From laid-back beach cottages along the Oregon Coast to luxury ski chalets in Vail to tropical getaways in Belize, Vacasa offers just the right retreat for any guest.

In today's busy world, a vacation is a precious opportunity to relax and reconnect with loved ones.

Vacasa offers the unique combination of professional management in privately-owned homes, making it possible for our guests to enjoy a one-of-a-kind vacation experience without compromising on service and convenience. Our team of passionate hospitality professionals is the finest in the industry, with each Vacasa team member (from housekeepers to reservations agents to local managers) working hard to ensure that each home and every guest is well cared for.

Vacasa is also committed to giving back to the local communities where we manage vacation homes.

Q: How old do I need to be to reserve a home?

A: In order to reserve one of our vacation homes everyone who is traveling must be at least 21 years old or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. In some areas, the age requirement may be higher. Please give us a call at 503-345-9399 for more information.

Q: Do infants count toward the maximum occupancy?

A: Generally, children under the age of 2 do not count toward the maximum occupancy.

Q: Can I bring my dog along?

A: Dogs are allowed in many of our homes. Prior to bringing your dog, you must check with Vacasa and pay the required nightly pet fee.

Q: What is the difference between FlipKey/VRBO and your site?

A: VRBO/FlipKey/HomeAway are advertising sites. We are the property management company that manages everything from marketing to maintenance and housekeeping. We advertise on VRBO and other sites to get our homes the most visibility.

Q: Can I bring more people than the maximum allowed listed?

A: Maximum occupancy does not only refer to the number a home can sleep, this is also the number of people allowed in the home at any given time. It is determined by the licensing authority based on the number of exits in the home and fire safety evacuation plan. Some counties or HOA's have codes that are strictly enforced. Please abide by the maximum occupancy number for the home at all times.

Q: What does Trip Protection cover? Is there a time-frame as to when I can add trip protection?

A: If Trip Protection is purchased, you will receive a full refund for any nights of your reservation cancelled due to a death in the family, illness, flight delays, flight cancellations, or road closures due to bad weather. You can add Trip Protection up to 30 days prior to your reservation. If you are booking and your check-in date is already within 30 days into your reservation, Trip Protection may only be added within 24 hours from the time of booking.

Q: I tried to book a reservation online but it gave me an error. How do I know my reservation is secured?

A: When booking online, if you hit the submit button more than once this will result in you receiving an error message that says either your dates are unavailable or that you already have a reservation. Typically the reservation goes through, but you are welcome to call us at 503-345-9399 to confirm.

Q: Can I get a breakdown of the total cost?

A: The rental quote includes all lodging, taxes, and fees. The breakdown of the total cost is in the green box on the website if you book the reservation online at vacasa.com. Simply click the green box to get the breakdown.

Q: What is Vacasa's cancellation policy?

A: You may cancel within the first 24 hours of booking the reservation with a full refund. Rental payments (less a 5% processing fee) are refundable up until 30 days prior to the reservation. We are unable to offer refunds on reservations cancelled within 30 days of the check-in date unless you purchase our optional Trip Protection plan and the reason for cancellation falls within the trip protection guidelines.

Q: What is the pet policy?

A: Pets are permitted in selected homes, depending on owner preferences. Some owners may have pet allergies and we ask that you only bring your pets into pet-friendly homes. The standard fee is $10 per pet, per night, with a minimum rate of $40 per reservation. The pet maximum and fee may vary by unit and will be listed on the home's webpage.

Q: Do you have any homes without a two night minimum stay?

A: Most of our homes have at least a two night minimum stay. We do have some condos and studios that allow for a one night stay and they should appear when searching for your dates.

Q: Do you take partial payments or must I pay in full upon booking?

A: All reservations under $2000 must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 but within 60 days of check-in must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 with partial payments and more than 60 days out must be paid in full 30 days before the start date of the reservation.

Q: Do you allow weddings in your homes?

A: Some of our homes do allow weddings with the owner's approval. Depending on the home, there may be additional fees, parking restrictions and guest count maximums. Please call us at 503-345-9399 for more details.

Q: How can I modify my reservation, and are there any fees associated with that?

A: Please call us at 503-345-9399 to help you modify your reservation. There could be additional fees depending on the change occurring, but we will walk you through everything before finalizing it.

Q: Do you have monthly rates for your homes?

A: The maximum number of nights one of our homes can be booked for is 29. Therefore, we do not offer monthly rates. The rates for our homes vary based on day of the week, local events, and season.

Q: I found a better unit than the one I booked, would I be able to modify my reservation and change it to the new unit?

A: It is possible to switch homes as long as the change is made more than 30 days prior to the reservation. If the modification results in a higher rental rate guests are responsible for paying the difference. Reservations can be modified without penalty up to 24 hours from making the reservation.

Q: Would I need to sign a rental contract for renting a vacation rental?

A: By booking a reservation, guests acknowledge and agree to abide by Vacasa's rental policies. Some of our homes will require you to sign a reservation contract agreeing to policies that are specific to that home. We ask that you review and sign the contract and return it to us via email or fax.

Q: How do I go about booking a vacation as a gift for a friend?

A: You can book and pay for a reservation for another person. However, you must ensure that the name and all contact information listed on the reservation, including the email address, are for the person that will be staying in the home.

Q: What is the difference between a hotel and a vacation rental?

A: All of our vacation rentals are owned by private home-owners and can be preferable to hotels for a number of reasons. They are typically more comfortable, offer kitchens for preparing meals and are more accommodating to those traveling with children and/or pets. Vacation rentals also offer a wider variety of accommodations which enables them to fit any vacation need, be that a mountain home for 25 or a beach cottage for 2.

Q: How do I pay for a reservation?

A: We accept the following credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express. We also accept electronic checks for reservations booked more than 30 days in advance.

Q: Is smoking allowed in the home?

A: Smoking is prohibited on the rented premises.

Q: Does the home come with linens and towels, or do I need to bring my own?

A: The home will be equipped with all the basic necessities. All the beds will be made with fresh linens and bath towels will be provided. If you would like beach towels, we recommend bringing those with you.

Q: What items can I expect to find in the home?

A: Please see the features and amenities section of the home listing. Vacasa also provides a few items to get you started, including: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, and small trash can liners. If there is something specific that you require, please make sure you bring it with you.

Q: What cable package does the home have? Will we be able to watch the game?

A: Rental properties are individually owned and each home will have a different cable vs streaming option. Vacasa cannot guarantee Television service or TV Channel availability.

Q: If I want to order the UFC Fight, a movie, or a game can I do so and have it charged to my credit card on file?

A: Our homes generally do not provide any sort of pay-per-view service.

Q: How do I obtain the keys?

A: We will e-mail check-in instructions 7 days prior to your stay including driving directions and the code to the lock box or electronic deadbolt.

Q: The lockbox only has one set of keys. Can we get another set?

A: We prefer the keys stay in the lockbox so that each member of your party can access the home at any time. This will eliminate the need for multiple key sets. It also prevents the keys from getting lost.

Q: There are two lockboxes here. Am I using the right one?

A: The lockbox closest to the door or on top is usually the guest lockbox. The other one is for our cleaning and maintenance staff. Occasionally the plates get swapped. If you are having trouble getting in using the code, try it on the other lockbox.

Q: Can I not pay the cleaning fee if I clean the home myself, rather than using your cleaning services?

A: No. Guests are not allowed to clean after their own stay. Our housekeepers meet very strict guidelines and are required to clean the home after each guest vacates.

Q: We've run out of toilet paper. Can you bring us some more?

A: Vacasa provides a starter kit of supplies only. If you think you will need more than what is provided, please make sure to bring some with you.

Q: We can't find any paper towels or dishwashing detergent. Can you bring us some?

A: Please check in all cabinets (under the sink, above the refrigerator) and if you cannot find what you are looking for, we will gladly reimburse you for picking some up. The same goes for the following items: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, small trash can liners, and propane for the grill.

Q: We can't get the fireplace/internet/hot tub/etc. working. Are there instructions in the house?

A: You should have received an email from us with check-in instructions that includes a link to a digital guest binder. With your reservation number, you will have access to all your house instructions. However, if no instructions are found or if you need further assistance please contact one of our Customer Service Agents at 503-345-9399.

Q: I am allergic to pet dander and other smells, but I want to stay in a pet friendly home. Is there any way to ensure that I won't be bothered by them for my stay?

A: All our homes are thoroughly cleaned after each stay. However, we are unable to guarantee that you will not have a reaction to a home that has been regularly occupied by pets.

Q: What are the check-out procedures?

A: Check-out is at 11AM and upon your departure we ask that you start the first load of laundry if there is a washer and dryer in the home. If you have time to begin a second load it is greatly appreciated by our housekeeping staff. A $75 per hour fee will be assessed for failing to vacate the unit by the agreed upon check-out time.

Q: Do I have to check in by a certain time?

A: Check-in is at 4 PM and guests can arrive any time after. There are some cases when early check-in is available. If that is the case, we will email you the morning of your stay to inform you that an early check-in option is available. Please note that we will not be able to confirm or deny an early check in request prior to the day of check in due to our cleaning schedules.

Q: Do you allow early check-ins?

A: An early check-in is dependent on whether or not the housekeeper has time to fully clean the home before your arrival. If guests are checking out the same day that your reservation begins, an early check-in is not allowed as it will not allow the housekeeper enough time to fully prepare the home for you. We will email you the morning of your check-in if early check-in is available.

Q: Can I get a late check out?

A: Late check-out is available if we do not have another reservation that night. There is a fee (plus taxes) associated. The fee varies from house to house. We can tell you if a late check-out is available three days before check-in. If you pay for late check-out you will have the home until midnight the day you check-out.

Q: What is your lost and found policy?

A: We will return your lost item to you if you call us within two weeks of your departure date. We do charge a $25 fee, plus shipping to cover the cost of labor, drive time, and postal fees. Any items not claimed within two weeks will be donated to a local charity.

We are not a single office, position, department, city, or region - we are a team! Every employee at Vacasa is critical to our success and our mission. We encourage employees to take advantage of each of our teammates' skills and talents for problem-solving - and treat other teammates with the same respect that they want to receive.

As we grow, both learning and teaching are critical to our team's success. Each team member should take the time to teach their co-workers how to be successful in areas in which they excel, and ask for insight from their teammates. Continually seek growth for themselves as an individual, for their role within Vacasa, and for Vacasa itself as a company.

3. We count on you

Behind each positive guest experience are countless Vacasa employees that were involved in creating that result. Any missing part to our machine jeopardizes our ability to deliver. We count on each employee to be on time, to complete their tasks, and to excel in their role. Each employee's input is crucial to our success!

4. Do the right thing

Be honest, be trustworthy, be ethical - even when no one is looking.

Vacation rentals made easy." We conduct business simply to create a consistent experience for owners, guests, and employees alike.

We help create amazing memories and fun experiences for our guests and owners. Our employees carry that into the workplace to create a positive and enjoyable environment with their teams every day.

Lots of growth requires lots of change - so embrace it! If an employee thinks a process could be easier or more efficient, they are encouraged to talk to their manager and take ownership to drive change in that area and each employee is asked to support the changes their teammates are driving in other areas.

Because "This is the way it has always been done" is never good enough. Instead, employees are encouraged seek out new ways to improve our policies and practices - and always be open-minded to new ideas, pushing the limits, and willing to think outside the box.

Here at Vacasa, we help travelers experience unforgettable vacations...and we look at working at Vacasa as an epic adventure of its own!

When you grow as quickly as we have been, every year (and month, and week, and OK, every day!) is an exciting one. We embrace opportunities, and have a tendency to hand out responsibilities to our employees to see how they can stretch and challenge themselves. This is a place to grow as an individual, and to be part of our collective growth as a company and a team...and so far, it's been an unbelievably rewarding journey together.

Day-to-day, we also have a lot of fun. We don't all work in the same office, of course—there's our Portland headquarters, our second office in Boise, and hundreds of amazing Vacasa teams across the country caring for homes, helping guests, and growing our business. Our local teams become very tight-knit, but we also love to gather in bigger groups at our regional Vaconferences, where our Vacasa leaders make sure that every employee understands the company's vision, our mission, and how much we appreciate every Vacaser from coast to coast!

Since our founding in 2009, Vacasa has grown from a single home in Long Beach, WA to managing thousands of homes, from beach cottages on the Oregon Coast to ski cabins in Vermont to tropical retreats in Belize—and beyond! We were ranked #9 on the Inc 500 in 2014 and continue to expand exponentially. The secret to our success? Exceptional local team members, a system that makes things easy, and a strong passion for the work we do!

Our rapid growth offers tremendous potential, and our company is committed to cultivating individual talents and skill sets. If you're looking to get out of a dead-end job, Vacasa is the place for you! Vacasa is looking to fill numerous job openings in our several growing regions.

Vacasa's success and continued growth would not be possible without our team of valued employees. Interested in becoming a key player and joining the Vacasa family? View our job openings to find a career that excites you!

When Eric and his wife Alia took responsibility for caring for Alia's family’s summer home, he learned firsthand how much work vacation homes can really be. And when he discovered there wasn’t a professional management company on the West Coast that could provide the services he was looking for, he decided to start one? and that’s how Vacasa was born. Today, the family's Long Beach, Washington cottage is one of over 1900 Vacasa homes spread throughout the globe - and our motto remains “vacation rentals made easy”.

Problem-solving, creativity, and openness: that’s our founder, CEO, and fearless leader in a nutshell. Eric has always driven Vacasa with his strong vision, but he’s also made it a priority to empower employees to help shape the company and their roles within it. Eric's conversations with Vacasa employees often start with three questions: “What do you like most about your job? What are you best at? OK, how can you spend more of your time doing that?”

Eric lives in Boise with his wife Alia and their two sons, Rhys and Rowen. He bikes to work daily, runs year-round, spends the summer mountain-biking, and spends the winter skiing - either backcountry, or in-bounds with his three year old son Rhys. And during Eric?s considerable travel to Vacasa destinations across the Western US, he stays in vacation rentals - to spend as much time as possible with friends, family, and employees.

Cliff is Vacasa’s co-founder, Chief Development Officer, and the most good-natured attorney you’ll ever meet. While still a member in good standing with the Colorado and California State Bars, Cliff’s role at Vacasa has always been more about relationship-building.

Since he first joined Eric at his kitchen table to launch Vacasa back in 2009, Cliff has overseen the expansion of our family of Vacasa home owners. Today, he leads our business development team with his obvious passion for connecting with our owners and sharing how Vacasa can make their lives easier.

Cliff lives in Southeast Portland with his wife Kate and their lab/pit mix Muddy, adopted from Portland's Pixie Project. In addition to his role at Vacasa, Cliff serves as a board member for Eugene-based MAPLE Microdevelopment. He has also completed the Eugene Marathon in 2012 and 2013 as part of a benefit for MAPLE, and he has produced, directed, and acted in several theatrical productions from Boston to Denver... and Cliff leads Vacasa’s Portland kickball team (although we don’t hold our abysmal 2014 record against him).

Kimberly’s current title is Vice-President of Operations, but she’s worn a lot of hats since being hired in 2010 as Vacasa’s third-ever employee. Today, she applies her attention to detail and hands-on leadership style to nearly all the areas she previously worked in: housekeeping, property management, maintenance, owner services, and guest experience.

With a professional background in interior design, Kimberly’s been known to rearrange furniture constantly (her own, her friends’, whomever doesn’t try too hard to stop her) and fulfill the Portlandia stereotype by making jewelry on the side.

If you want to talk about numbers, Scott’s listening - or two steps ahead. Since joining Vacasa in 2013, he has introduced our company - and in many ways, the vacation rental industry - to the power of data. From our rate optimization algorithms to the nitty-gritty of our marketing strategy, Scott has helped use data to deliver a better experience to our owners and our guests.

Scott's a tried-and-true Northeast Portlander, where he lives with his wife Lisa and hound dog Juno. He’s been actively involved in community-building, from serving as Chair of the King Neighborhood Association to co-founding the Friends of Last Thursday Art Walk organization. When not crunching numbers or supporting civic functions, you'll find Scott snowboarding on Mt. Hood or exploring the bountiful hikes Oregon provides. Scott also likes to stage his life milestones on mountaintops: he proposed to Lisa on Mount St. Helen’s, and they tied the knot at Skibowl’s warming hut on Mt. Hood.

Erik-with-a-K is our wizard behind the curtain: as CTO since 2011, he oversees all of our in-house technology, from our business applications to our website to our Smart Home Automation systems. And he does it all from his farm in southwest Washington, where he lives with his wife Jenni, daughter Maple, and a menagerie of horses, chickens, geese, dogs, and a guinea pig.

Erik’s professional background and personal interests are centered around open-source hardware and software. His “side project” is Digistump, a company he began after creating three of the most successful Kickstarter projects in the Portland area (Digispark, DigiX, and Digispark Pro). This led to Erik being featured in Steven Osborn’s book “Makers at Work: Folks Reinventing the World One Object or Idea at a Time”. And in his nearly nonexistent free time, Erik continues to be involved in the tech community by serving as an advisor to start-ups like Glowdeck and Brewbot.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Mendocino/
The villages, vineyards, and stunning natural beauty of the Mendocino Coast - or just "the Coast," as locals prefer - make this oceanfront slice of California an unforgettable destination for a laid-back adventure. Mendocino vacation rentals offer you a comfortable and cozy homebase for exploring one of the most remarkable locations on the West Coast.

Three hours north of San Francisco (and just shy of five hours from the Oregon border), you'll find a secluded, arts-minded paradise nestled between old-growth redwood forests and the churning waves of the Pacific Ocean... and there's no better way to experience this region than by living like a local in one of our Mendocino vacation rentals.

The village of Mendocino itself, once a logging boomtown, is now a little quieter and laid-back, with around 1,000 full-time residents. Thanks to the visiting tourists who arrive from the Bay Area on summer weekends, however, you'll find some truly wonderful restaurants, shops, and galleries to keep you entertained throughout your stay. Stop by Patterson's Pub for a pint of local beer and a bowl of clam chowder, or stock up on picnic supplies at Mendocino Market and head for the beach.

The entire coastline around the village is comprised of Mendocino Headlands State Park - the perfect spot for picnics, as well as hiking, beach combing, or simply soaking up the views of the rugged coastline and crashing waves. To get a little closer to the scenic wilderness, pay a visit to the knowledgable folks at Catch a Canoe & Bicycles Too to rent kayak, canoe, or bike for the day. The Big River, which empties into Mendocino Bay just south of town, is ideal for an afternoon of paddling - and Catch a Canoe even specializes in dog-friendly canoes so you can bring your four-legged best friend along for the ride!

The region surrounding Mendocino is full of fodder for excellent day trips. Head south to tiny Elk, California for breakfast the legendary Queenie's Roadhouse Cafe, or stop in Albion for a romantic oceanfront dinner at the Ledford House. Head out for a hike along the gorgeous, redwood-lined Navarro River. Or, drive north along Highway 1, stopping by the beautiful Point Cabrillo lighthouse on the way to funky Fort Bragg.

However you choose to spend your time in Mendocino, it's guaranteed to deliver that unmistakable Northern California sense of laid-back beauty. And Vacasa has the perfect Mendocino lodging in store, from dog-friendly beach houses to luxury country estates. Book one of our Mendocino vacation rentals today, and get your adventure started!
#Pathname:/usa/Utah/Park-City/
Between top-notch skiing, the star-studded Sundance Film Festival, and year-round natural splendor, you'll find that a getaway to one of our Park City vacation rentals guarantees to be an unbelievable adventure! Surrounded by fantastic ski resorts like Park City Mountain Resort, Deer Valley, and The Canyons, and home to world-class dining and shopping, there's something special for everyone to enjoy in this beautiful Utah resort town, and our rentals located in places like Bear Hollow keep you close to the action and surrounded by Northern Utah's impressive landscape. Thanks to its early days as a silver mining boomtown, Park City is full of wonderful Victorian mansions, homes, shops, and hotels - many restored to peak condition after skiers discovered Park City's powder in the 1950s. Since then, Park City has become a world-renowned destination for winter adventures, even hosting many Olympic events during the Salt Lake City games in 2002. There's much more to Park City than its slopes, though. With over 400 miles of wooded trails for hiking and mountain biking, Park City keeps outdoor lovers busy all year. Head out of town just 20 minutes and spend the day at Jordanelle Reservoir. Culturephiles will adore attending annual festivals celebrating food, music, and art, while every day of the year, historic Old Town Park City wines and dines its guests with excellent restaurants and bistros. And there's no better way to experience this beautiful destination than from the comfort and privacy of our Park City vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sunriver/

The Village includes rental outfitters and guide outposts where you can book fly fishing expeditions, guided horseback tours, ski lessons, snowshoe trips, and kayaking excursions. After you swim, fish, or shoot the rapids in nearby Deschutes River, you've only begun to experience what Sunriver has to offer. Try your swing on the links at one of the four golf courses in Sunriver: Meadows, Woodlands, Crosswater, and Caldera Springs. Some of our Sunriver houses and condos look right out over the green! There are two public parks for barbecues, softball, basketball, tennis, volleyball and horseshoes. Grab your bike, and head out on the 33 miles of paved paths that criss-cross the resort and connect you to the Village's shops, restaurants, and seasonal ice-skating rink. Sunriver's newest attraction is SHARC, a fully outfitted aquatic center with swimming pools, a lazy river, and hot tubs. With very few exceptions, all of our Vacasa homes offer complimentary passes to SHARC with your reservation! Whether you're seeking an outdoor adventure or a relaxing weekend curled up with a good book by the fireplace, there are a wide range of Sunriver vacation rentals to choose from, ensuring that you and your family will feel right at home during your Sunriver getaway!

Family Home between the Fairways with Views!

That 70's House on the Water

Offering activities, views and unique experiences for every type of traveler, planning a great escape to a Lake Tahoe vacation rental unlocks a world of adventures. Tahoe is more than just the meeting place of California and Nevada; it includes the crystal blue waters of Lake Tahoe, snow-capped mountains, and long hikes through lush natural forests. From lakefront cottages to cozy ski cabins, Tahoe vacation homes offer access to world-class skiing at resorts like Heavenly, Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, and Northstar. Enjoy the sparkling nightlife at area casinos Crystal Bay and Harvey's Resort, and practice your golf swing at any number of greens - Old Brockway, Coyote Moon, or the Bijou, just to name a few.

Foodies also have much to get excited about in this cosmopolitan mountain region. Local eateries showcasing fresh, regional ingredients in a variety of establishments for every taste and mood is the norm. Whether it's a plate of Sierra Powder Sushi Rolls at The Naked Fish in South Lake Tahoe, pints of Manifesto Pale Ale and Chicken Wings at Fifty Fifty Brewing Company in Truckee, or Durham Ranch Filet Mignon at Wolfdale's Cuisine Unique in Tahoe City, everyone will be sure to find something that delights their palette.

Nestled in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Truckee is just a hair west of the Nevada state line. Boasting 270 trails, 43 ski lifts, eight mountain peaks, and six terrain parks, this town is for the true outdoor adventurer. But wait: there's also an abundance of dining options, coffee houses, galleries and shops to satisfy a variety of visitors.  Nearby Northstar-Truckee is home to the famous Northstar Resort, with year-round activities from skiing and snowboarding to golfing and hiking.

Right on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe is Kings Beach, a community brimming with outdoor activities! Kings Beach State Recreation Area has over 700 feet of sandy beach for beachcombing, sand castle building, and just plain relaxing. Close to skiing and fishing as well, there's also casino gambling and entertainment nearby just across the Nevada state line at Crystal Bay.

An outdoor lover's dream, Tahoe Vista is a small community just west of Kings Beach, joined by its charming neighbor, Carnelian Bay. Picture yourself in a cute vacation getaway right near the water in either of these two postcard-perfect spots!

If you like a little more liveliness in your destination, Tahoe City is a vibrant, fun-filled playground right on the lake, with three great beaches - Tahoe City Commons, Tahoe State Recreation Area, and Lake Forest Beach. From here, you can take your pick of activities - enjoy a cruise around the lake, play golf at Tahoe City's historic course, raft the river, or in winter make the short drive to a number of ski resorts.

Just northwest of Tahoe City along Highway 89, Olympic Valley lies on the banks of the Truckee River. Home to Squaw Valley Ski Resort, this is the spot for world-class skiing and snowboarding. With a stay in a cozy ski condo, in addition to all the winter sports, you'll be ideally located to take the aerial tramway 8,200 feet to the resort's High Camp to enjoy dining, swimming in the heated pool, and a spectacular view of the surrounding peaks.

Not too far away, the ski resort towns of Alpine Meadows and Homewood are veritable winter wonderlands. From a private vacation lodge, to a ski-themed condo, these two locations are a great choice for avid winter sports enthusiasts. Just south of Homewood lies Tahoma, an area surrounded by natural scenic wonders. From your cabin in the woods, it's just a short distance to dog-friendly Bliss State Park, with its amazing mountain and lake views. Close by there's also Meeks Bay Resort and Marina, a popular place for water skiing, picnicking, and relaxing on the pristine sandy beach.

What can we say about South Lake Tahoe? There's the restaurants, clubs, and casinos. But then there's also canoeing  on the lake, golfing on a sunny afternoon, and hiking in a grove of pines - all with the backdrop of the majestic Sierra Nevadas. This is a truly unforgettable destination with something special in store for every kind of traveler!

The communities and cities around Lake Tahoe are as diverse as the many different year-round activities available in this scenic outdoor utopia - and we have the perfect Tahoe vacation rental just waiting for your next adventure!

The Chalet at the Lodge at Vail #4

It's no wonder the Vail Valley is one of the top destinations in the country for spending an adventure-packed vacation in cozy ski cabins or luxurious Vail Valley rentals! Boasting the second largest ski mountain in North America, five-star dining, fantastic festivals, countless trailheads, and more natural splendor than your senses can absorb, this premiere Colorado resort region attracts thousands of visitors each year in hopes of experiencing an authentic taste of Rocky Mountain living at its best.

It's surprisingly easy to get around the entire valley with the largest free transportation system in the country. You'll find convenient shuttle bus access near many of our rentals to whisk you away to the heart of Vail - even if you decide to stay in a peaceful cabin rental closer to a rushing river than a bustling ski resort.

For those who do like to keep their finger on the pulse of the town, you won't find a better spot than our luxury vacation ski homes in Vail itself, within walking distance to dozens of hotspots in Vail Village, Golden Peak, and Lionshead. Bavarian-style villages and pedestrian streets exude an Old World charm and host diverse boutiques and dining, from sandwich shops to five-star cuisine. Sunny pub decks invite you to share a mid-day beer, while dance clubs, live music, and karaoke bars bring the village to life once the sun sets. And, of course, the carefully manicured slopes of Vail Mountain are just steps away.

Looking for peace and quiet in your Vail Valley vacation home? Just five miles east, with stunning mountain and valley vistas, over 18 bikes paths, and a plethora of hiking trails just out your front door, our East Vail ski home rentals will provide an ideal gateway to the natural beauty and outside attractions of Vail Valley, without the crowds. Fish along Gore Creek, hike up the six mile trail to awe-inspiring Booth Falls, then take advantage of the hot tubs, pools, steam rooms, and recreation center at the Vail Racquet Club. For the more daring souls, the East Vail Chutes provide difficult terrain and a unique challenge for more advanced skiers. On the other side of town, West Vail was originally an expansion of Vail Resort, but is now a quiet, residential neighborhood. It's only a short drive or free shuttle ride away from the world famous resort, but a vacation rental here is a little less hectic than Vail Village, and ideally situated to exploit both the sunshine from the north, and the scenic alpine vistas from the south.

Head further west and you'll have your choice of not one, but two renowned ski resorts within close reach when you choose from our private vacation homes or condos in the quaint town of Avon, just 10 miles from the Vail slopes, and home to the fabulous Beaver Creek Resort. Known for its upscale and family-friendly accommodations, Beaver Creek Resort is comprised of three villages: Beaver Creek Village, Bachelor's Gulch, and Arrowhead, each connected by catwalks and boasting 25 ski lifts and 1,832 skiable acres. Visitors will enjoy ice skating in the center of the village, art galleries, and plenty of dining and shopping. In the summer, go paddle boarding on Nottingham Lake and don't miss the largest fireworks display over the Colorado Rockies.

Further west and set in a more quiet and residential community, our mountain homes in Eagle-Vail and Edwards will attract those looking for a more peaceful retreat. Located between Avon and Vail in the heart of the Eagle River Valley, Eagle-Vail is home to one of the finest golf courses around at the EagleVail Golf Club, as well as a deluxe public pool in the summer and excellent cross country ski trails in winter. A bit more removed, yet just 10 minutes to Beaver Creek and 20 to Vail, Edwards offers its scenic Riverwalk dotted with boutique shops, a world-class spa, and upscale dining at exquisite bistros and wine bars. Fresh waters, like the nearby Eagle River, will delight fisherman and entice kayakers, rafters and floaters alike.

About 25 miles further west, the small town of Gypsum occupies a prime spot right in the middle of the Rocky Mountains. From a vacation home surrounded by Red Mountain and Tenmile Peak, explore miles and miles of off-roading, hiking and biking trails, and cross-country and snowshoeing the backcountry in winter.

Choose your perfect vacation rental from our large selection of Vail Valley ski rentals including homes, cabins, and condos to discover how each of these charming mountain towns offer its own vantage point and unique access to the bountiful recreation activities throughout the White River National Forest that awaits each season.

The Christophe at River Run - The Executive

The Christophe at River Run - The Maven

A Sun Valley vacation rental is the perfect location for world-class skiing, snowboarding, fly fishing, rafting on the Salmon River, hiking, biking, snowshoeing and so much more. But besides being an ideal location for almost any outdoor adventure you could dream of, you'll also be surrounded by galleries, shops, a thriving arts scene, and wonderful eateries right in town! All that, plus over 200 days of sunshine a year! Interested?

Start with a cozy ski in/ski out condo in the cosmopolitan, resort-town of Sun Valley for a fun family vacation. Then hit the slopes at Dollar Mountain for beginner to intermediate runs, cross-country skiing at the Sun Valley Nordic and Snowshoe Center, and even holiday sleigh rides your whole group will enjoy. Of course, the more experience skier may want to check out the action at Bald Mountain, with its 3,400 vertical feet of slopes - but that mountain is just on the other side of town!

Now, don't go thinking that Sun Valley is just for winter. In nice weather, take a trip up the ski lifts and mountain bike down on dirt trails past wildflowers. Or gear up and check out trout fishing on some of the world's best fly fishing streams. With some luck, later you'll be sitting down to a perfectly cooked Trout Almondine in your comfortable Sun Valley vacation rental!

Like Sun Valley, nearby Ketchum (it's less than two miles southwest) is sandwiched between Bald and Dollar Mountains and right by all the resort action, but Ketchum is also a bustling little town in its own right. Set against snow-capped mountains, sparkling freshwater streams, funky galleries and shops downtown, with a lot of bright, year-round sunshine. A four season destination just like its neighbor to the northeast, it's the ideal location for vacation lodging like a golf condo or a cabin  in town.

In summer, its bright sun and warm afternoons make Ketchum a prime setting for a round of golf. Just north of downtown, the Bigwood Golf Course is a 9 hole, par 36 course and nearby, the Sun Valley Resort Golf Course has 18 holes for your tee off enjoyment. And after your game, head back to your Ketchum vacation home to lounge on the deck with a glass of wine before walking to the charming downtown for a delicious dinner out. If you visit in July, you may be able to check out the Ketchum Arts Festival, with over 100 artist booths, live music, food, and kids' activities.

Like many of the great Western ski towns, Sun Vally and Ketchum have it all - excitement, beautiful scenery, and lots to do, but here you'll find it all at an unhurried, laid back pace. So, leave the lines behind and pick your perfect Sun Valley condo or Ketchum cottage from our growing list of Sun Valley / Ketchum vacation rentals and start exploring the beautiful, central Idaho mountains.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Mexico/
A land of ancient ruins, bustling metropolises, sandy beaches, and hospitable people, Mexico has lured travelers for many centuries. A confluence of Meso-American and European culture, Mexico enthralls thanks to its colonial architecture, vast plateaus and mountains, and the majestic Rio Grande. Our gorgeous Mexico vacation rentals are a great base from which to explore this proud and beguiling land, from sea to shining sea.

Encompassing nearly 760,000 square miles, Mexico is as complex and varied as its people and history. The Mayans, Toltecs, Aztecs, and Spainards have all laid claim to its vast riches and you can see remnants of these ancient civilizations in places such as Teotihuacan, Chichen Itza, Monte Alban, and Tulum. "New Spain," as it was called for nearly 300 years, is responsible for the lovely colonial cities of Puebla and Zacatecas as well as numerous cathedrals and forts scattered throughout the country. During this time, Mexico introduced the world to tequila and what has become the most popular ethnic cuisine in the United States, both of which you can enjoy from your Mexico vacation rental.

Mexico abuts the Pacific Ocean, and the west coast affords visitors many quaint small and large towns along nearly 4,600 miles of coastline, from the Baja peninsula to the border of Guatemala. Head to Cabo if you're into tony resorts and celeb sightings. Puerto Vallarta still appeals to lovers - 50 years after Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton put it on the map - thanks to soft breezes, white sand, and lush orchids. Acapulco, the "Pearl of the Pacific," is just that: a shining jewel filled with charming cliffside restaurants and secluded beaches. The Michoacan Coast, between Nayarit and Oaxaca, boasts secluded beaches and coves amid mango and papaya groves. Punta Mita features many luxury resorts as well as restaurants catering to the jet set. Costalegre is truly the "Coast of Joy," thanks to an abundance of picturesque sleepy fishing villages.

Heading west, you'll encounter Mexico's capital and one of the largest cities in the world. With nearly nine million residents, Mexico City is a bustling financial capital but still retains a bit of vintage appeal. The neighborhood of San Angel, just five miles south of the city center, boasts cobblestone streets, Colonial-era architecture, and a variety of world-class museums. Xochimilco is another appealing Colonial-era gem, thanks to its floating gardens, brick streets, and 50 miles of canals. Condesa and Roma, two adjacent neighborhoods, are famous for their hipster vibe - think Williamsburg meets St. Germain - as well as their Art Deco buildings.

Further west towards the Gulf of Mexico, you'll find bustling resort towns with a decidedly more American flavor than those on the Pacific rim. From colonial resplendent Merida to the shopper's mecca of Playa del Carmen, the Yucatan Peninsula boasts myriad places to savor Mexican hospitality. Explore the Gran Museo del Mundo Maya in Merida before heading to the Mayan ruins in Uxmal. Playa del Carmen plays host to many a cruise ship so don't be surprised if you spy boat loads of tourists at the pre-Colombian walled city of Tulum (40 miles away) or the Sian Ka'an biosphere reserve (86 miles away), a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Regardless of which of our Mexico vacation rentals you choose to stay in, you'll be sure to enjoy the sun, sites, and flavors of Mexico.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Panama/
The land of "abundant fish, trees, and butterflies" is also the land of abundant sunshine, mountains, rainforests, beaches, and friendly locals! From cosmopolitan Panama City to coffee-centric Boquete to quaint El Valle de Antón, Panama is a country of sharp contrasts and cultural diversity.

More than 12 percent of the people are indigenous, with a large segment of the rest being of Afro-Antillean or Chinese origin. The food is a confluence of these cultures, as is the music and the colorful native dress, the pollera. Dance with other revelers during Carnaval in Panama City, or celebrate the Fiesta de San Juan Bautista in Chitré. Whatever you choose, our Panama vacation rentals are a great place to call home in this beguiling land.

Like other Caribbean nations, Panamanian culture is a mix of African, Native American and European influences, making it an appealing travel destination for anyone looking for urbanity and tradition. Pre-Columbian cultures included the Chibchan, Chocoan and Cueva peoples, all hunter gatherers. Once the Spanish arrived in 1501, courtesy of Rodrigo de Bastidas, the country became an economic and strategic powerhouse. Spain ruled for more than 300 years, using the tiny nation as a gateway to the lucrative Orient. Today it remains a gateway from west to east, thanks to the impressive Panama Canal.

The nation's capital, Panama City, is an international banking center divided into corregimientos, or quarters, with the old quarter attracting the most visitors thanks to its well-preserved colonial architecture and myriad old churches and plazas. Explore Panama Viejo, the old capital just minutes from downtown Panama City. This UNESCO World Heritage Site includes the ruins of the first Spanish city on the Pacific.

Heading out of the capital, visitors will come across white sand beaches, lush rainforests, and a plethora of coffee plantations. The Archipelago de Bocas del Toro is on Panama's west coast border with Costa Rica. Sink your feet in the white sand or explore a hidden cove on a lazy summer day. The Archipelago de San Blas is old-school Panama with nary a condo or mall in sight, but plenty of palm trees, soft sand and turquoise water. The uninhabited Cayos Los Grullos, Holandeses, and Ordupuquip are popular with yachters and off-the-beaten-track types. Playa Coronado is just one hour away from Panama City, and boasts white powder and big city conveniences. Playa Barqueta near the town of David is popular with surfers and turtle-hatching enthusiasts.

Near the Costa Rican border lies the province of Chiriquí. Mountains give way to beautiful valleys and waterfalls. Head up to the small town of Boquete, famous for its coffee. Many of the area's producers - some of the world's best - host tours and tastings throughout the year. A thriving expat community in town means more chances to go river rafting, hiking, or biking near Volcán Barú, the country's highest point.

A stay in one of our Panama vacation rentals isn't complete without a journey into the country's intriguing and dynamic interior. The provinces of Veraguas, Los Santos, Herrera, and Cocle offer a pleasing variance to the popular coastal towns. Isla Colba, a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its pristine rainforests, sits in the Pacific and is a draw for scuba divers. Penonome boasts the Omar Torrijos National Park, a vast wildlife refuge with great hiking trails. The Sarigua National Park in Parita features 8,000 hectares of semi-desert and a pre-Columbian settlement. El Valle de Antón is a quaint town in the middle of an extinct volcano and lush forests, luring hikers and bikers galore.

If it's sun, sand, and culture you crave, then head down to Panama. Our luxurious Panama vacation rentals await your arrival!

Belize is known for its laid-back attitude, diverse ecosystems, and ample adventure opportunities, which all combine to form a wonderful vacation destination! Bordered to the north by Mexico, the south and west by Guatemala, and the east by the Caribbean Sea, Belize is one of the top travel spots in Central America.

There's a ton to love about Belize, but perhaps its biggest attraction is the beautiful beach. With hundreds of miles of coastline, you can relax while strolling barefoot along the soft sand - working only on your tan! You could also explore the coastal mangrove swamps or rent some snorkeling or scuba gear and dive underwater to discover the sea life around the Belize Barrier Reef. With more than 450 small offshore islands, an abundance of fresh seafood, and some of the most scenic coastline in the world, the shores of Belize may just be the perfect place for a beach getaway. Spots like Placencia exemplify Belize's laid-back, picture-perfect beach getaways!

Things to Do in Belize

If you prefer to seek out adventures, the interior of the country has many tantalizing options. The pristine, sunny beaches of the coast quickly give way to a rainforest-type atmosphere that is teeming with life and excitement. In the western Cayo District, you will find dense hardwood forests with hidden waterfalls, mysterious caves, and hundreds of species of wildlife. This jungle is an ideal place to enjoy a breathtaking hike through the trees, kayak down a river, go spelunking, or take a scenic guided horseback ride. Belize still has a prominent Mayan influence, but for a real taste of history you will enjoy taking a daytrip to numerous Mayan ruins, including Caracol, Xunantunich, Altun Ha, and Lamanai, where you can marvel at the architectural feats and dream of days past.

Eco-tourism brings many visitors to Belize, and the country is well-known for its toucans, tapirs, and monkeys. It even features the world's premier jaguar refuge at Cockscomb Basin. A large portion of the wilderness is protected, so the land is as unspoiled - and as beautiful - as possible. With a low human population density and a huge expanse of jungle, plants and animals truly thrive here.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Australia/
It's been called the land Down Under, OZ, and Great Southern Land. Immortalized in book, music, and film, Australia beguiles the senses with beautiful coastal beaches, verdant valleys, snow-capped peaks, and a savage and majestic interior. With only 23 million people in a country approximately the size of the United States, there's plenty of space to roam as wild and free as the land. From cosmopolitan Sydney to chic Melbourne to trendy Brisbane to laid back Perth, our Australia vacation rentals will place you in a holiday mindset the minute you walk through the door!

First sighted by Europeans in 1606 and first settled more than 150 years later, Australia has a unique and somewhat turbulent history. Established as a British penal colony - many modern-day Aussies proudly trace their lineage back to the original convicts - the country became a gold rush and agricultural mecca in the 1800s, increasing the population tenfold. Today, Australia's demographics are as diverse as the country itself. You'll find Asian, Greek, and Eastern European businesses in many of the big cities.

Abutting the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Australia is a land of sharp contrasts across seven unique territories. The eastern territories - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania - features sun-kissed beaches, green valleys, and majestic rivers. While the central and western territories - South Australia, Northern Territory, and Western Australia - boast rugged landscapes and laid back cities.

New South Wales is the most popular state and the one that gets the most foreign visitors. Sydney boasts beautiful beaches filled with beautiful people - Bondi Beach is a can't-miss stop! Don't forget to dine at one of the Michelin-starred restaurants or take in a performance at the iconic Sydney Opera House. Throughout New South Wales you'll find plentiful beaches and friendly small towns, from blink-and-you'd-miss-it Bungowannah to surfing mecca Wollongong to koala paradise Port Macquarie.

?Queenland is the state of sunshine and surf, with gorgeous coastal hamlets and a vibrant surfing culture. Brisbane is the largest city and features 12 months of sunshine, as well as beautiful parks, art galleries, and an increasingly hip populace. The Sunshine Coast is just 64 miles to the north, offering exactly what it describes. Cairns is your entry to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the most pristine natural wonders of the world. Grab your snorkel gear and make sure to take pictures since it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience!

Heading south and to the west, you'll come across stately Victoria. Chic Melbourne is known for its world-renowned fashion houses and cultural offerings, including the Victorian Arts Centre and the Australian Ballet. Victoria (and part of New South Wales) is also home to the Australian Alps, the only snow-capped areas in the country and the land's sole ski destination.

Tasmania is the island off the island, featuring unique flora and fauna - don't worry, the Tasmanian Devil won't hurt you - and a host of festivals throughout the year. The capital, Hobart, is the second oldest in the country and is a popular port for ships of all varieties, although most specifically for scientists heading to Antarctic bases. The city is also known for its well-preserved Georgian and Victorian architecture.

The center of the country is as beautiful and awe-inspiring as the coastal portions! South Australia is known for its 18 world-class wine regions, most notably the Barossa Valley. Make a day of savoring the award-winning Shiraz and Colombard! Regal Adelaide boasts numerous dance companies, as well as a love for Aussie Rules Football, rugby, cricket, and even basketball.

Head north and you'll enter the Northern Territory, the least populated of the Aussie states and one of the most ethnically diverse. You'll find numerous national parks within its half million square miles. The capital of Darwin is tropical in climate and relaxed in nature! Most of the population lives along the Stuart Highway in the towns of Palmerston, Alice Springs, Katherine, Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek. Hop on the legendary Ghan railway, one of the most epic train journeys in the world. The locomotive traverses nearly 1,900 miles of desert terrain from Darwin to Adelaide. Stop off in Alice Springs and head to Uluru (Ayers Rock), the red monolith sacred to the Aboriginals. You'll find springs, rock caves, and paintings at this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Western Australia is the largest territory in the country and is so wild and untamed that few reside outside of the Southwestern border. Much of the interior has been unfortunately abused by farmers, leading to its designation as a biodiversity hotspot. Perth is the largest city, with arts organizations aplenty and a strong local music scene. The town of Freemantle features many well-preserved 19th century buildings.

Arrow Point, Lake Coeur d'Alene Views At Their Best

Boasting an incredible variety of activities, our Coeur d'Alene vacation rentals have something for everyone - from a sleek and modern condo in the city, near galleries, restaurants, and shopping to a cozy cabin in the wilderness, where you can fish, hike, and enjoy being surrounded by nature.

You'll be able to take in all the sights - lakes, the Coeur d'Alene National Forest, and even a segment of the northern Rocky Mountains (the Bitterroot Range) from here. This part of the Idaho Panhandle will definitely delight vacationers with a wide range of activities and multitude of incredible landscapes. There's even a blossoming North-Central Idaho wine region for wine connoisseurs to discover, a movement led by Coeur d'Alene Cellars, a small, family-owned winery.

Where to start your northern Idaho adventure? Couer d'Alene itself is much smaller than its big city neighbors towards the west coast, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in style. From a swanky, modern condo downtown, you'll have a prime location for the monthly Second Friday Artwalk, numerous dining options, a cruise on Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Sunday Market, even a relaxing afternoon at Spa Coeur d'Alene. And if you hear the call of the outdoors,  you're still close to skiing at Silver Mountain Resort, the 24 mile, multi-use Centennial Trail, and kayaking out on the lake.

A mere 37 miles south of Coeur d'Alene, lies quaint and historic Harrison, a terrific choice for a cycle-centric getaway. Home to a spot along the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes, a 72 miles paved trail that goes all the way from Mullan by the Montana border, through Harrison, and straight on west to Plummer, near Washington. In addition, outdoor adventurers will have parks, trails, and lakes to explore, jog, hike, and boat. A charming Harrison cabin in the woods puts you right in the middle of the great outdoors, but still near an historic downtown with a small selection of shops, galleries, and eateries.

North of Coeur d'Alene, only six miles to be exact, is another small town full of Idaho charm. Hayden, right near scenic Lake Hayden, is your home base for enticing getaway packed full of water sports like fishing, jet skiing, and boating, to more leisurely activities like golfing, or just plain relaxing on the front porch. From your Haden vacation home, you'll be right near over 40 miles of shoreline, as well as only a short car ride from all the action in bustling Coeur d'Alene to the south.

On your next Pacific Northwest vacation, you may just want to head a bit inland to Idaho. Whether you choose a modern retreat in the city, a quiet lakefront cabin, or a condo on the edge of a meticulously manicured golf course, a stay in a Coeur d'Alene vacation rental will leave you counting down the days until your return to this beautiful, full-of-surprises Idaho destination!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Italy/
Ahh, Italia… even the name of this beautiful country is easy on the taste buds! Known as lo Stivale (the boot), Italy is the fifth most-visited country in the world, and for a variety of reasons. Home to exquisite artwork, varied terrain that includes everything from sky-high mountains to sweltering seasides, and, of course, outrageously delicious food, you can't go wrong in practically any corner of this sprawling country. Whether you're gazing at the Tower of Pisa or devouring a plate of carbonara, Italy has something for everyone to enjoy!

This stunning area is known for its towering mountains, colorful cliffside towns, sparkling lakes, and fashion-forward cities – each of which has its own unique history and attractions.

Mont Blanc (15,781 ft.), located just between the border of France and Italy, is the highest mountain in the Alps as well as the prime destination for many adventurers looking for skiing, snowboarding, and mountaineering. Lake Como and Lake Garda are world-famous for spectacular views and waters, and you’ll lose yourself shopping in Milan and Turin, which serve as business and fashion epicenters.

Along the coast, the Italian Riviera beckons with the vibrant port city of Genoa, as well as the five charming fishing villages called the Cinque Terre!

Best-known for the flooded streets and canals of Venice, this part of Italy boasts several fantastic cities as well as famous menu items that will keep your mouth watering for days. Although it is technically sinking, the water-built city of Venice maintains a cultural richness that’s difficult to beat – the gondolas slowly cruising the canals, the fantastic art galleries and recitals, the naturally romantic backdrop - it’s all still alive and well in Venice!

The rugged limestone cliffs and mountains of the Dolomites provide epic views and great hiking options, not to mention more ski resorts. Verona, Bologna, Ferrara, Parma, and Padua are all other fabulous cities with varied cuisine and shopping options to discover.

History buffs, art addicts, and nature-lovers alike will delight in Central Italy's diverse options for indoor and outdoor activities. Whether you're wine-tasting in the rolling hills of Tuscany, admiring ultra-famous artworks in Florence, immersing yourself in the 'City of Soul' (aka Rome), or wandering the lush green national parks of Abruzzo, this region has something for everyone to appreciate.

Although La Santa Sede, or the Vatican, is technically its own independent state, the views of Rome from the top are mind-blowing - regardless of your religion!

Rich in diversity, agriculture, and spectacular landscapes, Italy's south is a must-see for anyone looking for the full Italia experience.

Filled with coastal charm and a gritty, city-centric ambiance, Naples is the heart of the south. It stubbornly adjoins the base of Mt. Vesuvius (4,203 ft.), which is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, providing for ample excitement. The Pompeii ruins are one of the most visited attractions in Italy, and the numerous rustic castles, villages, and beaches along the Amalfi Coast attract thousands of tourists each year.

The Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Sicily each boast their own varied cultural escapes and attractions as well, not to mention absolutely gorgeous coastlines and delicious cuisine.

Wine, cheese, gelato, espresso, pasta, prosecco, pizza... did we mention the wine? Spend the day exploring different terrains or stuffing your stomach, and the nights filling your ears with classical opera music, or the chatter of the passionate Italian language!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/chile/
Chile’s unique landscape—situated between the endless Pacific coastline and the towering Andes Mountains—fill this South American country with major bucket-list items worth checking off! About 17.3 million people live in this beautiful and diverse nation, with the bustling capital of Santiago home to about six million. Whether you’re learning the Cueca (the national dance), climbing a massive volcano overlooking a bright blue lake, or kicking around at the locals’ fútbol game, Chile provides endless options for cultural and outdoor activity. Through a history of mixing of European colonization and indigenous people, this part of South America has a unique culture, language, and landscape that's all its own.

Bordering Peru and characterized by the Atacama Desert, the Norte Grande (far north) of Chile is best known for its extreme climates. The Atacama Desert, a plateau that runs east from the Andes, is so arid that it’s known as the “driest place on earth” – most of it receives barely an inch of rain per year, and some places haven’t seen a drop for centuries. Besides its reputation for dryness, the Norte Grande also boasts spectacular scenery like salt flats, geysers, volcanoes, and coastal bluffs. Many types of vegetation and animals grow and thrive north of the Atacama near the Loa River and surrounding valley. Chile’s most precious copper, nitrate, and silver deposits and mines are also found in Norte Grande and worth seeing, especially the Chuquicamata, which is the biggest open-pit copper mine in the world. Antofagasta, the largest city in this region, has incredible coastal views and an economy based on the port activity and minerals found nearby.

Just south of the Norte Grande region is Norte Chico (the near north), which stretches from the southern border of the Atacama to just above the capital city of Santiago. Home to Chile’s highest peak, a stratovolcano named Ojos del Salado, as well as Laguna Verde (its ultra-famous lake), this region is mountainous and has distinct valley ranges that run all the way from the Andes to the Pacific Coast. The climate is a bit more forgiving than its northern neighbor, with moderate temperatures and more rainfall. The Elqui Valley is the most famous part of the Norte Chico, ideal for cattle-raising and growing fruit, and almost all Pisco (the ubiquitous and delicious Chilean brandy) is grown here. On the western coast, high bluffs that overlook the Pacific form more distinct microclimates, and La Serena is popularly for its beautiful beaches.

Known as the “heartland” of Chile with the largest urban areas and rich agricultural resources, the Zona Central is a beautiful and diverse region to visit. Home to the Central Valley (located between the Andes to the east and the coastal mountain ranges west), this area has a fertile Mediterranean climate ideal for growing fresh fruits, grapes for wine, and other agricultural exports. There’s great alpine skiing in the Andes due to higher precipitation, and there are also lush old-growth forests and national parks to the south. Four incredible urban areas call the Zona Central home: the capital of Santiago, the populous Concepción, and the colorful coastal cities of Valparaíso and Viña del Mar. The Zona Central holds about two-thirds of the country’s population, and for good reason!

Reaching from the waters of the Río Bío-Bío in the north to the Isla de Chiloé in the south, the Zona Sur is known as the “lake district” of Chile. With the rugged backdrop of the Andes mountains to the west, there are numerous turquoise lakes that spot the horizon amidst snow-covered volcanoes and green farmlands. Adrenaline-pumping adventure sport meccas beckon tourists from all over the world to the Zona Sur with tons of hiking, kayaking, volcano-scaling, and snowboarding options abound. Pucón and Puerto Varas are known for their sports-centric audiences, while Temuco, Valdivia, and Osorno hold most of the region’s population.

Perhaps the most spectacular yet extreme part of Chile, the Zona Austral offers a variety of landscapes all the way from the glaciers of Patagonia down to Punta Arenas, the largest and southernmost city on the planet. Much of the Zona Austral is not properly explored, providing exciting and untouched landscape for thousands of miles. The gorgeous granite peaks of Torres del Paine National Park are rightfully a well-known destination in this region of the Chilean Patagonia bordering Argentina, and a series of snow-capped mountains and volcanoes lead down to the coastline. Thousands of islands surround the coast off of Punta Arenas and Tierra del Fuego, including the well-known Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez.

Whether you're braving the heat of the sprawling Atacama Desert in the north or hitting the Andes for some world-class skiing and snowboarding in the south, the diverse and stunning country of Chile offers something for people of all ages and backgrounds to enjoy. With the popularity of outdoor sporting options and a rich, diverse language and culture, find out for yourself why this country is quickly becoming a top tourist destination with a stay in one of our Chile vacation rentals!

I am a Junior at Boise State University studying Psychology. I love people and hope to become an Occupational Therapist in order to help them overcome difficulties.

I am recently graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management. Winning the Vacasa scholarship last year was fantastic! I was/am an adult learner, with two children, and work a full time job. Every little bit helps when you're trying to support a family and go to school! I would encourage every student to apply for scholarships. I especially loved the Vacasa scholarship because I was able to write about something I love, the area I happen to live in!

Aspen is planning to graduate in the spring of 2016 and apply to be a student within Boise State's new Political Science Graduate Program and later pursue a career in public service. In her free time, Aspen enjoys discovering coffee shops around town and spending time with her friends, family, and her

My name is Jose Contreras. I was raised in the west coast (PDX), aka the best coast. I am currently at the UO working on obtaining a degree in advertising, my focus is art direction. During my down time I love designing random things. When school gets busy I'm still designing, because that's what I do. I am an od ball, a bit weird. I guess I embraced the whole "keep Portland weird." I love being different.

My name is Melanie and I am a stay at home mother of four. I am currently in college working towards my Masters degree in teaching. I am a native to the Pacific Northwest, born and raised.

My name is Katrina Dickinson. I'm 18 years old. I work as a receptionist at a real estate company. I babysit on "the side". I attend Portland Bible College and I'm one out of 6 children.

I am Alondra Duran, and I am incredibly grateful for being one of the selected winners from last year! I?m trying to save up as much money as possible in scholarships to be able to attend college and hopefully law school in the future! I am a junior in high school who loves photography as my creative outlet, and hope to turn my hobby as a photographer into a side business while I build a career in the Law field!

I was born in South Carolina but moved to Newport, Oregon when I was five. I love living amongst the trees and the ocean, but life often keeps me too busy to enjoy the outdoors. I am a team captain on the NHS Swim Team and spend my hours in chlorinated water instead of the salty sea. Next year I will graduate from Newport High with an IB Diploma and then go off to university. I hope to spend the rest of my life here in the Northwest.

I'm a current college student from Eugene, Oregon, and I received $300 from Vasca scholarships for last fall term. This really helped me out with going to school; I'm so thankful for the opportunity Vacasa helped me acquire.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Fort-Bragg/
Fort Bragg, with a newly revitalized downtown and a decidedly hippie bent, is the laid-back commercial center along the Mendocino coast. For the most relaxing getaway, reserve one of our lovely Fort Bragg vacation rentals: from cooking your own meals to soaking in your private hot tub, there's no better way to experience this unique California town!

Fort Bragg is a military town only in the historic sense: in 1857, it was established as a military outpost that was abandoned within a decade (that other Fort Bragg is in North Carolina). Today, Fort Bragg's order of business is primarily tourism. With over 7,000 year-round residents, it's the largest town along the Coast, and home to the highest concentration of shops, restaurants, and other services in the area... but surrounded by peaceful beaches and hiking trails to explore.

The downtown area is a lovely spot to while away the occasional rainy day. Stop by Headlands Coffee for a latte to sip as you wander among the unique shops and galleries: downtown Fort Bragg is home to everything from a specialty sock store to a tattoo museum and a fantastic art collective. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants to keep you well-fed, along with North Coast Brewing Company and the excellent Roundman's Smoke House for smoked sausages, fish, and cheeses of all kinds.

Pack up your picnic supplies and head for the great outdoors! Nature lovers of all types will find the perfect afternoon activity in and around Fort Bragg. The Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens are just south of town, a beautiful cliff-top hideout of flowers, streams, picnic areas, and walking trails. Fishermen and kayakers will find plenty of spots to launch a boat or drop a line, thanks to the two creeks that flank downtown and the numerous sea caves and quiet bays lining the coast.

Just north of town is MacKerricher State Park, with miles of trails suitable for hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. And, of course, there are plenty of smaller villages and hamlets to explore during your stay. Charming Mendocino is just 15 minutes south, and the more rural hamlets of Albion and Elk, California are within a 40-minute drive as well. Each offers its own unique take on the peaceful, laid-back pace of life that epitomizes the Coast.

For those who want to explore the Mendocino coast without getting too far away from it all, consider booking one of our Fort Bragg vacation rentals today.

#Pathname:/usa/Florida/Panama-City-Beach/
The bustling resort town of Panama City Beach beckons vacationers with its 27 miles of sparkling sandy beaches, kid-friendly activities, and some of the best sport fishing in Florida. From family vacations to romantic couples' retreats, our Panama City Beach vacation rentals offer a wonderfully private and refreshing way to experience this gorgeous destination.

Just ten miles from Panama City proper in Northwestern Florida, the town of Panama City Beach is easily accessible and conveniently located halfway between Pensacola and Tallahassee. The Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport is just 20 miles away, making travel a breeze for visitors arriving by air.

Of course, the top attraction for guests staying in our Panama City Beach vacation rentals is the beach. The sand is famously white and pristine here, and there are more than two dozen miles of shoreline to explore. Make sure to pay a visit to St. Andrews State Park, often recognized as one of the country's best beaches - and also home to fishing jetties, hiking trails, and marshes.

If the sand takes top honors in Panama City Beach, then the water is a very close second. Sport fishing is incredibly popular here, with marlin, snapper, grouper, mackerel, and trout just a few of the species of fish that you can pursue on a charter boat. Divers can explore some fascinating shipwrecks off shore, as well as 50 artificial reefs crawling with sea life...and back on land, can check out the deepwater diving exhibits at the Museum of Man in the Sea.

Any good resort town has a plethora of restaurants, bars, and shops to visit on a rainy day, and this one is no exception. While most of our Panama City Beach condo rentals include excellent kitchens, you won't want to miss the city's dining scene. Grab a burger and fries at The Front Porch, or head to Firefly for the famous "She Crab" bisque and a friendly fine-dining experience. David's New Orleans Style Sno-Balls offers a huge array of sno-balls, as well as truly authentic po-boys and daily specials like jambalaya and gumbo.

If you need a new bathing suit or souvenir during your visit, Pier Park is literally a one-stop shop: this beachfront retail and recreation center has big names like JC Penney and Target, as well as restaurants, a small amusement park, and a movie theater.

Founded in 1864 as a result of the California gold rush, Tahoe City has always been a resort town for seekers of thrill and relaxation alike. To this day, Tahoe City vacation rentals are as desirable as discovering a shiny gold nugget.

Sitting on the shores of Lake Tahoe, this historic town is easily accessible via CA 89 off of Interstate 80. Tahoe City lodging is often located in quiet neighborhoods close to the California ski attractions and outdoor activities that you visit the lake for.

Lake Tahoe beaches are beautiful! In the summer, Tahoe City Commons offers live music. To the north at Carnelian Bay, you’ll find the dog-friendly Patton Beach. Into boating? You can launch it over at the free Coast Guard boat launch between Tahoe City and Dollar Point. If you're more of a river person, the Truckee River, with its fishing, rafting, kayaking, and more, is less than a mile away.

Other than the pristine blue waters of Lake Tahoe, the area is heavily visited for its ski resorts. Our Tahoe City vacation rentals are within five to 20 miles from the best resorts in California. Perhaps the most popular are Alpine Meadows and Squaw Valley in Olympic Valley, named for being the site of the 1960 Winter Games.

Enjoy a meal in one of Tahoe City's 32 eateries, or take an evening cruise on the lake. This area hosts a number of seasonal festivals. Kick off summer at the annual Heart and Solstice Festival in June. July beckons yogis to the Wanderlust Festival. Celebrate Oktoberfest at the Tahoe City Harvest Festival. Sand, snow, or surf, Tahoe City is a great place to stay any time of year!

For your next North Lake Tahoe getaway, check out our Tahoe City vacation rentals for a perfect balance of convenience and relaxation.
#Pathname:/usa/Idaho/McCall/
From summertime boating to winter skiing, there's always an outdoor activity to enjoy while spending time in a McCall / Valley County vacation rental! The year-round resort town of McCall is small but lively, offering a wonderful mix of quaint charm and world-class adventure. Waterski on Payette Lake, hike through Ponderosa State Park, snowboard at Brundage Mountain - or just relax by the fireplace in your own private McCall cabin rental. The choice is up to you! Much of the activity around McCall is centered on gorgeous Lake Payette, where there's swimming, water and jet-skiing, sailing and every sort of fun thing you can do in the water.

Further inland, there's also a world of things to do! Anglers: Drop your line in the nearby Salmon or Snake Rivers and see if you can snag one of the trout, salmon, steelhead, perch and smallmouth bass. You can kayak or canoe on those rivers as well, or sign up for an adventure on the rapids with one of the five whitewater rafting businesses in the area. Nearby Ponderosa State Park has numerous hiking and biking trails and spectacular views from Osprey Point. Golfers won't feel left out! You'll be able to tee-up at McCall Golf Course. Jug Mountain and White Tail golf courses are also nearby.

For skiers, Brundage Mountain is less than ten miles from town. There are plenty of snowmobile trails around McCall and places to ice-skate as well. At the end of a busy day on the lake or the slopes, this charming resort town offers a surprisingly wide selection of cafes, brewpubs, and family-friendly dining to enjoy. Of course, when you're staying in a McCall vacation home, you can craft your own five-star meals in your fully-stocked kitchen or around a backyard barbecue.

From luxury log cabins to affordable lakefront studios, all kinds of travelers can find their perfect getaway here in beautiful McCall!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Bandon/
With a world-class golf course and one of the most beautiful beaches along the entire Oregon Coast, quiet Bandon is truly a can't-miss destination. Perched at the point where the winding Coquille River empties into the Pacific on the Southern Oregon Coast, a stay in one of our Bandon vacation rentals will leave you feeling utterly relaxed - or pleasantly exhausted from all your adventures. In Bandon, you can have it both ways!

Bandon is famous as the home of the Bandon Dunes Golf resort, with jaw-dropping ocean views right from the courses, but there's much more to this charming town than first meets the eye. The beach itself, for one, offers some of the most picturesque sunsets scenery, with jutting rocks breaking out of the long stretch of sand. To the north of town lies Bullards Beach State Park, home of the historic Coquille River Lighthouse, and to the south is Bandon State Park. In between lies Bandon itself.

For a little window shopping, head to quaint Old Town Bandon, home to an eclectic collection of shops and galleries where you can pick up a piece of local art or handmade chocolates. For heartier dining, visitors will find all kinds of eateries ranging from fine dining to wine bars to laid-back crab shacks.

Little Bandon has a lot to offer: plan a visit to an Oregon Coast vacation rental here and explore Face Rock, visit the neighboring cranberry bogs, or learn exactly why Bandon is often called "The Storm Watching Capitol of the World". From sunny summer days on the beach to chilly winter evenings curled up by a fire, you'll find Bandon delivers lifelong memories every day of the year.

The Gentleman Farmhouse on the Bluff

People are drawn to Portland for all kinds of reasons: Bicycle culture. City parks. Food carts. Farmers markets. Artisan coffee. Charming neighborhoods. Easy access to the ocean AND the mountains. And, of course, the beer. Whatever brings you to a Portland / Willamette Valley vacation rental, it's a good bet that that you'll find a dozen other things to love (and even a few reasons why you should just stay!). For lovers of nature and the great outdoors, Portland is a veritable paradise. Just west of downtown, accessible by bus, light rail, or a long walk, sits Forest Park. With over 5,000 acres full of hiking and biking trails, it is the largest natural forested area within city limits in the country. Adjacent to Forest Park is the more developed Washington Park, with the famous International Rose Test Garden, the Oregon Zoo, the Japanese Garden, and the Children's Museum. When you want to get out of the city for a day trip, the options are endless! Just half an hour east of your Portland vacation rental, the gorgeous Columbia River Gorge begins with its miles of scenic viewpoints, waterfalls, windsurfing meccas, and mountain biking trails. In just over an hour, you can be on the snow-capped peak of Mt. Hood, or in an hour and a half, sticking your toes in the Pacific Ocean along the beautiful Oregon Coast. Wine lovers will want to head south to explore the majestic Willamette Valley, where gorgeous vineyards bump up against humble hazelnut farms in this exceptionally idyllic slice of Oregon, all less than an hour from downtown Portland. After all that hiking, mountain biking, snowboarding, windsurfing, and wine tasting, you'll certainly have worked up an appetite. Luckily, Portland is home to an ever-increasing food scene with excellent restaurants, brewpubs, food carts, wine bars, and markets offering locally grown (and brewed) fare. From March to December, the Portland Farmers Market is a must-taste experience every Saturday, and you can barely walk two blocks without tripping over a new food cart carving out its own delicious niche (think specialty grilled cheeses, Surinamese noodles, gourmet pot pies, and the now-ubiquitous Korean tacos). In Portland's locavore-focused restaurants, you're more likely to see exposed brick walls and reclaimed driftwood barstools than white tablecloths, but you certainly won't have any trouble finding a five-star meal for that special night out. Imbibers should make a point to check out the Inner Eastside neighborhood, just across the Willamette River from downtown proper, where some of the city's best breweries, distilleries, and wine bars all sit within walking (or stumbling) distance of one another. Life is good in a Portland vacation rental, and getting around is easy. The public transit system makes it possible for visitors to explore the entire city without a car. Of course, if you want to really want to experience Portland like a local, rent a bicycle and explore some of the city's charming neighborhoods full of coffee houses, boutiques, bookstores, and parks. Just be warned: you really might not want to leave!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Florence/
The living is good in Florence, Oregon. With a charming downtown, easy access to amazing sandy beaches, and impressive sightseeing just outside of town, Florence is bigger than the average coastal town; over 6,000 lucky residents calling Florence home year-round. Still, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in town has a friendly and slower-paced atmosphere that puts visitors instantly at ease.

Florence sits on the Siuslaw River, separated from the Pacific by the northern end of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Wind-sculpted mountains of sand stretch for forty miles south, making a gorgeous backdrop for unusual activities such as dune-buggy-riding and sand boarding; or, simply take a blanket and a beach chair to enjoy some of the coast's most beautiful beaches.

For a different kind of scenery, head north from your Florence vacation rental about 12 miles to one of the Coast's most photographed spots, the elegant Heceta Head lighthouse at the stunning Devil's Elbow State Park. Nearby, the wildlife viewing made possible at the Sea Lion Caves will win over even those normally skeptical of roadside attractions. Back in Florence, the historic Old Town is a delightful waterfront business district, home to restaurants, antique shops, art galleries, and a history museum.

Eating well is not difficult in Florence. Plenty of seafood restaurants, chowder houses, and cafes line Bay Street, but make a special point to stop for the crab-encrusted halibut at local favorite The Waterfront Depot. The best beer list in town is found at the laid-back Beachcomber Pub, or for something less potent, grab a cup of freshly-roasted coffee at Siuslaw River Coffee Roasters and enjoy the waterfront views from the patio.

A Florence vacation rental is less than an hour and a half from Eugene, about two and a half hours to Salem, and just over three to Portland. Within two hours, visitors can be exploring the aquarium at Newport, enjoying the vistas of Cape Perpetua near Yachats, or golfing at the famous Bandon Dunes; but in all fairness, Florence herself offers plenty to keep the whole family busy, happy, and well-fed!

Just west of Tillamook sits charming Oceanside, a small village home to beach getaways, a beautiful sandy shoreline, and easy access to the best attractions the Northern Oregon Coast has to offer.The hillsides over the ocean are dotted with beautiful beach houses, providing the lucky residents with panoramic views of the Pacific and the not-too-distant Three Arch Rocks Natural Wildlife Refuge.

An Oceanside, Oregon vacation rental nestles you just south of Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint, a park that includes hiking trails, a historic lighthouse, and old-growth Sitka spruces. The park is a stop off point along the Three Capes Scenic Route, a 40-mile loop drive that showcases some of the Oregon Coast's most  spectacular viewpoints, rocky cliffs, and undisturbed beaches. The town of Oceanside offers its own beautiful stretch of sandy beach, with views of the Three Arch Rocks in the distance and some truly awe-inspiring wildlife viewing. The area is known as a refuge for puffins, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and sea lions, plus seasonal whale-watching. For more active types, the beach and surrounding natural areas are perfectly suited for hiking, surfing, horseback riding, kayaking, and kite-flying.

While more of a quiet residential community than a bustling tourist destination, Oceanside does include a few local spots that visitors will greatly appreciate. Of course, a good Oregon Coast town will have a local coffeeshop, and Oceanside's Brewin' in the Wind is a very good one. For nights (or mornings) when cooking in your beach house's full kitchen sounds like a chore, Roseanna's Cafe serves fresh seafood and homemade desserts. Many weekenders stop in Tillamook, just twenty minutes from town, to stock up on groceries before settling into Oceanside's delightfully slower pace of life.

An Oregon Coast vacation rental in the quiet, peaceful beachfront community of Oceanside makes an excellent spot for a weekend getaway, but is also ideal as a home base for a longer Oregon Coast adventure. Oceanside is just over an hour from popular tourist towns to the north, such as the upscale boutiques of Cannon Beach and the souvenir shops along the Promenade at Seaside. Heading south, Newport's waterfront attractions such as the Oregon Coast Aquarium are just over two hours away; within an hour and a half, visitors can reach the casinos of Lincoln City or quieter charm of Pacific City. All the attractions of the Northern Oregon Coast are within easy reach, but returning to the peace and natural wonder of your Oceanside vacation rental makes for an unforgettable experience.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Cannon-Beach/
Meet Cannon Beach Cannon Beach is one of the Northern Oregon Coast's most popular getaways, but still offers the charm and peacefulness of a beach resort community. Tucked between the evergreen-covered mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, a Cannon Beach vacation rental is a treasure trove of beautiful scenery and natural attractions. The area is home to the iconic Haystack Rock, some of the coast's most lively tide pools, and spectacular seaside cliffs, while supporting a vibrant local business district and arts community. Some of the region's finest restaurants, wine bars, clothing boutiques, galleries, and local theaters dot the quaint downtown streets, making the area a prime Oregon Coast vacation rental destination for those who want to enjoy the finer things in life along with the rugged beauty of the Oregon Coast. Cannon Beach Outdoor Recreation The beach itself, considered one of the state's finest, is dominated by the monolithic Haystack Rock. At low tide, curious beachcombers can be found examining and photographing the starfish, sea anemone, and crabs that make their homes in the tide pools at the rock's base. The sandy white shores are popular with sand castle builders, kite fliers, swimmers, sunbathers, horseback riders, and four-legged Frisbee chasers alike. From your cozy beach house, beautiful state parks and recreation areas surround Cannon Beach, with a number of spectacular hikes and scenic vistas. Ecola State Park lies just north of town, and don't forget your camera. You'll want it as you hike up to the viewpoint at the Tillamook Head Lighthouse... or reach a deserted stretch of sand at the end of the Indian Beach Trail... or follow in Lewis & Clark's footsteps along the Clatsop Loop Trail. Other nearby attractions include the sandy shores at two state recreation areas, Arcadia Beach and Hug Point. Cannon Beach Attractions Carefully guarded development has kept many of the big-name chains out of Cannon Beach, resulting in a unique sense of community in the small town. Here, some family-run businesses have become local institutions, so don't be surprised when residents politely insist you try the bacon-wrapped dates at Sweet Basil Cafe or pick up a bottle of huckleberry balsamic vinegar at The Oil & Vinegar Bar. We suggest you take their advice! Only an hour and a half from Portland and under four hours from Seattle, a Cannon Beach vacation rental makes a great home base to explore the scenic Northern Oregon Coast. The more touristy attractions of Seaside, including the Promenade's souvenir shops, arcades, and buzzing atmosphere, are only fifteen minutes north on Highway 101; head south for a slower pace in sleepy Arch Cape (five minutes away) or laid-back Manzanita (twenty minutes).
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Rockaway-Beach/
In 1909, developers established Rockaway Beach, Oregon as a seaside resort in the tradition of its Long Island namesake. The small community connected by train to Portland, and served as a popular getaway for "city folk" for well over a hundred years. Today, it's a somewhat quieter but equally desirable Oregon Coast vacation rental destination for those seeking a quintessential beach town experience. With seven miles of picturesque sandy shoreline and a chain of inland lakes left behind by a long-ago channel of the Nehalem River, Rockaway Beach is one of the coast's most popular spots for outdoor enthusiasts. Boating, fishing, crabbing, sea kayaking and sand-castle building are just a few of the area's star attractions. Just south of town, photographers flock to the beautiful Twin Rocks for a jaw-dropping image of the sun sinking below the horizon. During the summer months, take a ride along the historic Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad, departing from Rockaway Beach's iconic "Little Red Caboose". With a full kitchen back at your cozy Rockaway Beach vacation home, you'll be able to catch your own dinner, be it Dungeness crab, Coho salmon, or clams. All the equipment needed can be found and rented at facilities such as the iconic Jetty Fishery. When you've had your fill of cooking, head out for oceanfront dining at the Sand Dollar for a change of pace! Rockaway Beach is less than two hours' drive from Portland, and only fifteen minutes north of Tillamook's dining, shopping, and famous Cheese Factory. A Rockaway Beach vacation rental makes an excellent home base to spend a day exploring the best of the Northern Oregon Coast; the shops & galleries of Cannon Beach, boardwalks of Seaside, and laid-back lifestyle of Manzanita are all within an hour's drive north. Head south and take in the awe-inspiring beauty of the Three Capes Scenic Drive, or just relax on the beach at Rockaway. After all, that is why people have been flocking here for over a century.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Waldport/
Waldport is the perfect Oregon Coast vacation rental destination for those who like their beaches less crowded, their streets less congested, and their pace a little slower, while still staying close to all the action of the Central Oregon Coast. This sleepy fishing village is just half an hour's drive from Newport's star attractions, but provides a much more relaxing and laid-back atmosphere to enjoy at the end of the day. Plus, the town itself is surrounded by beautiful state parks and recreation areas, offering plenty of reasons to avoid the crowds up north and enjoy the great outdoors. Fishermen will be thrilled to find that the Alsea River winds through Waldport, bringing with it some of the region's best salmon and steelhead runs. Crabbing and clamming are also excellent here, with the Alsea Bay Bridge being a popular spot to drop traps and pots during Dungeness season. Stop by the Dock of the Bay Marina to rent all the equipment needed to catch the freshest dinner on the coast. Even non-fishermen will delight in paddling around Alsea Bay and its surrounding estuaries; visit the Kayak Shack, a rental shop run by entrepreneurial students at Waldport High School. Just outside of town, be sure to spend time exploring the tide pools at Seal Rock, beach combing at Ona Beach, or Governor Patterson Memorial State Recreation Site. Or, head inland to hike through the beautiful old-growth Sitka spruces in the often-overlooked Drift Creek Wilderness Area. A Waldport vacation rental offers more in the way of peace and quiet than lively restaurants or shopping, but is close to Newport (thirty minutes north) and Yachats (twenty minutes south). Both towns offer enough high-quality seafood restaurants, family-friendly burger bars, and cozy beach-town pubs to please everyone. For rainy day activities, Newport's aquarium, historic lighthouses, museums, and art galleries provide plenty of entertainment; to explore one of the Coast's most charming downtowns and stunning views, head to Yachats and the nearby Cape Perpetua Scenic Area. Waldport is only an hour from Corvallis, two from Salem, and less than three hours from Portland. Close to the hubbub of Newport, the charm of Yachats, and surrounded by natural beauty, a vacation rental in peaceful Waldport is certainly one of the best-kept secrets on the Central Oregon Coast. Don't miss out!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Seaside/
Seaside is the Northern Oregon Coast's most popular and family-centric destination, with its bustling beach side tourist district offering plenty of entertainment and activities for visitors of all ages. Only an hour and a half from Portland, the resort town has been an oceanfront getaway for "city folk" since the mid-1800s. With an ample selection of pizza parlors, seafood shacks, antique shops, and souvenir stands, a Seaside, Oregon vacation rental is an ideal destination for those who want to enjoy the beauty of the Oregon Coast without giving up easy access to plenty of dining, shopping, and entertainment options. The beach itself is wide and sandy, with amenities such as public bathrooms and the 1.5-mile paved Promenade providing an easy stroll along the shore. The young and young at heart frolic in the surf, build sand castles, fly kites, or rent bicycles for a beachfront ride. During the warmer months, nearly every weekend brings an event or festival town. The entertainment district near the Prom (as locals call it) is full of rainy-day activities, ranging from arcade games and carnival rides to the Seaside Aquarium. For those who like to cook, Bell Buoy of Seaside offers local seafood such as clams, oysters, and Dungeness crabs, ready to take home to your beach house's kitchen. More adventuresome chefs can dig in the sand for razor clams or toss a crab trap over the 12th Avenue Bridge (just make sure to get the proper licenses at a fishing or sporting goods store first!). Dining out, of course, brings a multitude of options. A few classic Seaside dining experiences include carne asada tacos at Casa del Sol, hazelnut-crusted halibut at Maggie's on the Prom, and a giant pepperoni pie from Fultano's Pizza. We also suggest stopping by Yummy Wine Bar & Bistro for a glass of Willamette Valley's finest paired with exceptional cuisine and McKeown's Restaurant & Bar for its friendly atmosphere and fresh Northwest seafood. A Seaside vacation rental offers convenient access to all the highlights of the region. Cannon Beach's upscale shopping and dining options are only fifteen minutes south, with the beautiful hiking trails of Ecola State Park in between. Heading north, charming Gearhart offers a slower pace just five minutes away, or travel twenty minutes to historic Astoria with its bigger-city amenities. Sitting only ninety minutes to Portland and three and a half hours to Seattle, a cozy beach house in Seaside makes for a uniquely fun-filled home base to explore all the Northern Oregon Coast has to offer.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Welches/
Cozy cabin the woods or an amenity-packed golf condo? An afternoon of skiing or snowboarding? Hiking or golfing first thing in the morning? A stay in one of our Welches vacation rentals will have you pondering tough decisions like those! Now an outdoor destination year-round, the town's humble beginnings took place back in 1882, when Samuel Welch and his son William started developing the land around the creek that would come to bear their names. From that first small getaway in 1893 to Oregon's first golf resort in 1928, Welches is now home to three golf courses, so be sure to bring your clubs! When you take a break from the links, grab your fishing rod. From its origin way up in Reid Glacier, the Salmon River runs right through Welches and with it come wild salmon and steelhead. (Fish populations are strained, so it's catch and release.) Check out The Fly Fishing Shop along Mt. Hood Highway to pick up gear, book an area fly fishing excursion, or just swap fishing tales with the staff. For a more hands-off approach to wildlife, hike the Cascade Streamwatch Trail where you can view wild fish in their natural habitat. A Mt. Hood vacation rental in Welches is the perfect destination if you're into cycling, pick from one of 45 bike routes around town. Hikers can choose from 31 trails of varying lengths and difficulty in the Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness Area. And, of course, there are plenty of places to climb, raft, horseback ride - whatever your outdoor activity of choice, it's here! But, no matter how you spend your time, you'll want to unwind after your adventure with some sweet potato fries, local grass-fed beef burgers, and cold beer at the Rendezvous Grill. Of course, just like the neighboring towns of Brightwood and Rhododendron, Welches does double duty in winter. There are four ski resorts nearby, as well as opportunities for cross country skiing, snowshoeing, tubing, and snowmobiling in the ample National Forest lands. Around the holidays, take a festive sleigh ride around the downtown. At the end of the day, you'll find there's nothing better than heading back to your Welches vacation rental, sitting down in front of a warm, toasty fire, and enjoying some hot cocoa!

By the Bay Cottage in Old Town

Few crowds, excellent restaurants, and close proximity to the breathtaking views of Cape Perpetua: it's no wonder the picturesque village of Yachats is nicknamed "Gem of the Oregon Coast". Nestled along the mouth of the Yachats River, halfway between Newport and Florence, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Yachats offers the all-too-rare combination of a charming downtown, beautiful beaches, and a sense of real tranquility. While the town of Yachats itself is charming, the biggest draw in the area is Cape Perpetua, arguably the site of the best viewpoint along the entire Oregon Coast. The 803-foot-high viewpoint offers a panoramic view stretching 150 miles north-to-south, and almost 40 miles out to sea on a clear day. Just a few miles south of town, the official Cape Perpetua Scenic Area includes an informative visitor's center and over twenty miles of hiking trails leading to unforgettable scenic vistas. Nearby parks at Neptune Beach, Cummins Creek, and Smelt Sands offer additional spots for hiking, picnicking, wildlife watching, and fishing. Before or after a long day of exploring the surrounding scenery of your Yachats vacation rental, fuel up or unwind at one of Yachats' many eateries or pubs. There are a surprising number to choose from given the size of the town, but a few local favorites include the Green Salmon for organic coffee and pastries; the historic Drift Inn for drinks, pub fare and live music; Luna Sea Fish House for fresh, local seafood; and the Yachats Underground Pub & Grub for beers and burgers. Yachats is just over three hours from Portland, two from Salem and Eugene, and just an hour and a half from Corvallis. It's a little more secluded than many of the Coast's other destinations, but still within an hour of Newport's bustling attractions, Florence's photogenic scenery, and plenty of deserted beaches and sleepy fishing villages in between. After a stay at a charming Yahacts beach house, it will be easy to see how Yachats earned its nickname, and why many locals (and Arthur Frommer) consider it one of the top destinations along the Oregon Coast.

These resort town getaways include kitchenettes or full kitchens and are right near the slopes at Brian Head Resort.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Cambria/
From the dreamily dubbed Moonstone Beach to the quirky Nitt Witt Ridge, Cambria is a Central California Coast destination for the free spirited and fun-seeking families alike. Plan a relaxing beach escape slightly off the beaten path and stay at one of our cozy Cambria vacation rentals.

Stretched out over eight-and-a-half square miles on scenic route Highway 1 and halfway between Monterey Bay and Santa Barbara, Cambria is one of the prettiest towns in California. Its closest major metropolitan area is Fresno, 135 miles northeast, but this village is easily accessible via many state and US routes, as well as the San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport.

With miles of coastline, native Monterey pine groves, and wandering wild turkeys, this seaside town of roughly 6,000 friendly residents is all about the beach habitat. Nature thrives here among the protected areas, including the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve with its coastal Bluff Trail, Cambria State Marine Park where snorkelers and kayakers can observe seals, and White Rock State Marine Conservation Area, at which researchers study the rich inter-tidal zones.

For a relaxing Cali coast experience, go to Moonstone Beach. Bring snacks from the year-round Cambria Farmer's Market or fill up on brunch at Moonstone Bar and Grill at the southern end since you'll likely get lost in moments spent meandering the well-maintained boardwalk, combing for semi-precious jasper, and holding hands on the many benches. Make your way to Leffingwell Landing to search for whales and surfers as the wind whirls scents of fragrant flora all around you. Leffingwell Landing is part of Hearst San Simeon State Park, which includes a gorgeous beach hike along the ocean bluffs.

Why not tour the Piedras Blancas Light Station? This Pacific lighthouse first guided sailors in 1875 and still shines today. Just a mile south is the largest elephant seal rookery on the US west coast. Observe the mighty marine mammals safely from the large parking lot or boardwalk. After all of this exploring, you’ll be grateful for the comfy beds at your Cambria beach house.

Unique Cambria attractions include Nitt Witt Ridge, a folk art destination that could only exist in California. The Pewter Plough Playhouse is considered a hidden gem. Share in coastal Californian cuisine at Cambria restaurants from the sophisticated Black Cat Bistro to the rustic Boni’s Tacos food truck. Craving craft beer? Grab a seat at Cambria Beer Company. With Paso Robles wine country just over 30 miles east, you'll be inspired to hang out at the Moonstone Cellars tasting room. Bring home a bottle to pop and share at any of our Cambria vacation rentals!

As part of San Luis Obispo County, Cambria is surrounded by other beach hamlets and Central California towns. An easygoing day trip from Cambria could start with homemade breakfast in your vacation rental then a jaunt south on Highway 1. Stop to stretch your legs in the "old west" town of Cayucos and pick up sweets at Brown Butter Cookie Company. Continue onto Morro Bay for lunch and a stroll on its dog-friendly beach, crowned by the impossible-to-miss Morro Rock. From Morro Bay, Highway 1 leads inland toward the county seat, San Luis Obispo. Stroll downtown and stay for a movie at the Art Deco Fremont Theater or Sunset Drive-In.

Northeast of Cambria is Lake Nacimiento for boating and swimming. Unlike the frigid and rough Pacific waves that only surfers and sea otters dare to tackle, Lake Nacimiento allows you to get down to your bikini and swim under the hot sun. Rent stand-up paddle boards or go for a speedy raft ride.

Get to know or reacquaint yourself with California through one of our Cambria vacation rentals for a getaway filled with beautiful beach vistas and wildlife.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Carpinteria/
Located along the stunning oceanside in Santa Barbara County, a Southern California vacation rental in sleepy Carpinteria offers a quiet, charming beach community with good surfing swells, as well as peaceful calm waves and a long, sandy beach.

At only 11 miles east of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria makes a great home-base for exploring this beautiful, sun-drenched region of California. When you leave your beach bungalow, head to the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve for bird watching, the state beach for surfing, or Carpinteria Bluffs Nature Preserve for a day of hiking.

From here, you can head west along the coast to Santa Barbara for wine tasting or further southeast to spend time in the neighboring town of Ventura. Although you could opt for a scenic afternoon drive along Highway 101, if you stay put in town you can enjoy a sunny afternoon looking for shells along the beach and working up an appetite. Popular restaurants right in town include Zookers for banana-crusted salmon or the Worker Bee Cafe hearty breakfasts, lunches, and coffee drinks. Of course, at your Carpinteria vacation cottage you'll have a full kitchen to whip up your own culinary creations!

#Pathname:/usa/California/Carmel-by-the-Sea/
Our Carmel-by-the-Sea vacation rentals make a lovely home base for your next Central California Coast getaway. Carmel, California is also known as Carmel-by-the-Sea, and this quiet community offers beautiful beach vistas...and is especially dog-friendly!

Resting on the Monterey Peninsula, Carmel-by-the-Sea is just over a two-hour drive south from San Francisco. Below its cypress-covered hills and upscale homes is the scenic Carmel Bay. Just to the north, you can easily reach the family-friendly Monterey and the youthful Santa Cruz. This entire region offers a range of coastal atmospheres, so there's something for everyone!

Perhaps the best way to experience this hamlet is on foot, which is easy in Carmel. This place loves dogs, and many of the local businesses and outdoor attractions are pet-friendly. There are even restaurants offering dog menus!

Start by grabbing a latte for some window shopping at Carmel Village along Ocean Avenue, where many merchants welcome dogs. At the end of this street, you'll find yourself at the Scenic Road Walkway, a pedestrian-only path opening to views of the bay. Bring your camera!

Experience even more memorable scenes on the 17 Mile Drive, a coastal car and bike route accessible from Carmel. It winds through several visit-worthy points 600 feet above the shore, like the often-photographed Lone Cypress that has stood above Pebble Beach for 250 years. When you park your car to take in the views, you may spot a harbor seal in the surf - only to turn around and see mule deer grazing in succulent patches.

Carmel is also known for its rich arts history as many American writers, photographers, and actors lived in the area since the early 20th century. At the outdoor Forest Theater you can see the annual Carmel Shakespeare Festival. The Tor House hosts literary events and tours to commemorate its former resident, California poet Robinson Jeffers. Perhaps Carmel's most famous citizen is its former mayor, Clint Eastwood.

Just about a 20 minute drive north of our Carmel-by-the-Sea vacation rentals is Monterey where you'll find many family-friendly attractions. Perhaps the most well-known is the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a magnificent indoor and outdoor exhibition displaying and supporting California's coastal and ocean wildlife. It's conveniently located on Cannery Row, alongside restaurants and shops.

In the summer months, you may enjoy a jaunt farther north along Monterey Bay to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk. Here, you and your family can enjoy a charming amusement park right within steps of the beach.

Our Carmel-by-the-Sea vacation rentals will allow you to relax in a private setting while exploring one of the most beautiful and visitor-friendly regions of the California coast. Where will you stay?

Located just off of Highway 1, and equidistant from San Francisco and Los Angeles, this small town with a big beach is more than just the perfect stopover. Rich seabeds, awesome waves, and a vibrant history make Cayucos a primary destination for anglers, surfers, history enthusiasts, and anyone with a longing to relax inside a gorgeous landscape. And, our Cayucos vacation rentals will put you in the center of it all.

Things to Do in Cayucos, CA

Located between Morro Bay and Cambria, the rich environment of Cayucos means there are tons of opportunities for outdoor recreation, especially in and around Cayucos State Beach. Fishing off the open portions of the legendary pier is a treat. There are also plenty of touring and boat options for deep sea and kayak fishing. Biking, horseback riding, golfing...even skating in one of the four nearby skate parks, are all popular activities.

Both expert and newbie hikers will love the rugged terrain available for exploring here. Montaña de Oro State Park, with its infamous 661-foot volcanic peak named Black Hill, offers both easy and challenging routes. The California Coastal Trail and the grasslands of the Estero Bluffs also provide lush and rugged paths that dip in and out of ravines, weaving through some of the most bountiful land that California has to offer.

With its legendary fishing comes fantastic local restaurants! Spots like the Schooner's Wharf offer indoor and outdoor dining by the sea (though you'll feel like you are sailing away on the sea)! Foodies will love the Historic Cass House Inn and Restaurant, which prepares its award-winning dishes with all locally sourced ingredients. Of course, there are plenty of places to score dreamy seafood chowder and other delicacies of the sea. Wine lovers will want to be sure to book a tour of the peerless Central Coast wineries.

Cayucos is in the middle of a cornucopia of things to do on the Central Coast! In addition to being halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, it is within a day-trip's drive from many small towns and attractions. The Piedras Blancas Rookery on Highway 1 is home to elephant seals and a total of 15,000 marine animals. Cayucos is only about 20 miles from Hearst Castle in San Simeon. William Randolph Hearst's former estate is one of the only "castles" in the United States and is now a historical monument offering daily tours that often include a ticket to a movie about the history of the estate, to be viewed at the Hearst Castle Theater.

San Luis Obispo County boasts with many parks, campgrounds, a Monarch butterfly grove, and many other charming small towns. Cayucos is only an 18-mile drive from the "happiest town in America," San Luis Obispo which features the eccentrically gorgeous Madonna Inn. Cayucos is also only 30 miles from Pismo Beach, and 33 miles from Grover Beach, both of which offer wonderful recreation opportunities.

These hot springs are said to have restorative effects, so don't pass up an opportunity to try out the city's most famous attractions!

A little more quiet and peaceful than its better-known neighboring towns to the north, a stay in one of our Mendocino coast vacation rentals in Elk offers sweeping views and natural splendor along with true relaxation.

Despite its diminutive size, Elk offers some lovely dining options for its lucky visitors.

Sitting along California Highway 1 on the Pacific coast, Gualala is easily reached from US 101. It's south of Mendocino, Albion, and Elk, with Sonoma County bordering just below. At 115 miles north of San Francisco, Gualala is out of reach of the hustle and bustle of the Bay Area. Over the coastal ridges to the east is Northern California wine country; its neighbors are the similarly quiet Anchor Bay and Sea Ranch.

Say it aloud - "wha-la-la." That's how this seaside gem is pronounced, and it's just as delightful to visit as it is to say. The name comes from a Kashaya Pomo phrase that refers to the downward flow of the Gualala River into the ocean, which is a spot where gray whales migrate two each year.

Start off your day whenever you want, because there's no reason to be in a hurry here! Fix yourself a fabulous breakfast in the kitchen of your Gualala vacation home, then take your pick from relaxing and revitalizing activities like biking, fishing, and golfing at Sea Ranch Golf Links.

The Northern California Coast is all about escaping the hustle and bustle of the state's crowded cities. It's rustic and wild, yet serene at the same time. If you're looking for a taste of sophistication, take a day trip inland to heaven - a.k.a. wine country.

Get up early and take a leisurely drive south on California Highway 1, then turn east onto State Route 116 toward Duncan Mills, a charming village offering Cape Fear Cafe for a nice breakfast, as well as vintage shops and art galleries. Continue on 116 toward Guerneville, home to many must-visit Russian River wineries.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Indio/
When you choose to stay in one of our Indio vacation rentals, you’re signing up for bright blue skies, ever-present sunshine, and gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains.

The main appeal of choosing one of our Indio vacation rentals, of course, is the city’s proximity to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Known by most simply as “Coachella,” this two-weekend spring festival celebrates life, love, and music under the blazing heat of the desert sun.

If you’re looking for fantastic Coachella lodging to celebrate this world-class music festival in style, staying in Indio is a great option!

If Coachella isn’t your thing, no worries: Indio is also famous for its polo clubs. Spend some time at Empire Polo Club to get a taste of this exciting sport. During the winter polo season, games occur every Sunday, and general admission tickets are completely free.

Polo isn’t for everyone, but if you’re a golfer, you’ve come to the right place: the Coachella Valley is famous for its beautiful golf courses, and Eagle Falls Golf Course in Indio is one of the best. Designed by architect Clive Clark, this 18-hole, 6,715-yard course is simply stunning, and widely rated as a must-see for any novice or seasoned golfer.

There is plenty to see and do right in town, but if you’re looking for a little more, our Southern California vacation rentals in Indio open up the door for many exciting day trips and excursions!

Venture west and take a ride on the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, the world’s largest rotating tramcar. Visitors without a fear of heights are in for a treat: breathtaking views and a wonderful restaurant await those who make it to the top!

For travelers in search of even more adventure, Joshua Tree National Park is just a stone’s throw away.

Exuding an old-Tahoe mountain rustic appeal, with the added comfort of modern amenities, our vacation homes will put you within minutes to fantastic skiing at Homewood Resort, ranked one of the top 10 ski resorts in California/Nevada by SKI magazine in 2012.

Homewood Mountain resort offers 1,260 skiable acres and eight lifts, each with breathtaking and unobstructed lake vistas to accompany you downhill. Sheltered from high-range winds thanks to towering Ellis Peak, and with a handful of old-growth forest glade runs, the resort is a true Tahoe treasure.

While skiing may be the main draw in the winter, Lake Tahoe summers offer endless options for outdoor recreation. From your Homewood vacation rental, enjoy easy access to an extensive paved trail system that follows the lake all the way to Meeks Bay to the south, Tahoe City and Dollar Point to the north, and further along the Truckee River to Squaw Valley, encouraging runners, walkers, bikers, and rollerbladers to explore the North and West Shores more fully.

If you're staying in one of our Monterey vacation rentals, chances are you're planning a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. If not, you should! It beautifully showcases 35,000 different marine animals and plants, many native to the dense underwater kelp forests in Monterey Bay itself.

Try to go on a weekday to avoid crowds, and make sure you check the aquarium's schedule for free volunteer and marine biologist talks about exhibits. Fun fact: this site was prominently featured in the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home!

The aquarium is located on Cannery Row, which you may know from John Steinbeck's novel that captures the sardine cannery culture that once dominated the area in the 1930s.

As one of the Nine Sisters, a series of volcanic lava necks formed thousands of years ago, Morro Rock stands in the causeway between the ocean and the harbor. Perhaps you'll see its resident gulls, cormorants, and the endangered peregrine falcons. In the tide pools below, look for starfish, hermit crabs, and coral. If you're lucky, you may spot a wild sea otter lounging on a raft of kelp! You could also bring a kite or try out windsurfing at just north of the bay.

If you come during early October, the Morro Bay Harbor Festival highlights the best of the area's food, art, and music. In December, be ready to be dazzled by the town's Lighted Boat Parade.

Inland, less than an hour's drive, are tons of attractions for everyone. For even more outdoor reveling, Los Osos Oaks State Natural Reserve has trees hundreds of years old set among the ancient dunes. Bring your camera around sunset to capture amazing shots. Hikers of all levels could take the trail on Black Hill, another of the Nine Sisters. For sky-high views of the sea, go to Harmony Headlands.

If you like a little car-cruising, there are many spots to stop at inland. In nearby Santa Margarita you can conquer zip-lining and horseback riding; history buffs will enjoy the 18th century mission and museums in San Miguel. While each of these places have wineries worth visiting, the best central California vineyards are found in Paso Robles.

Northstar the resort is centrally located in Truckee, which sits along Interstate 80. The resort sits in the middle of highways 89, 267, and 28, which borders the lake. Five minutes away is Kings Beach, a popular North Shore escape. Nearby are Alpine Meadows, Squaw Valley, and Tahoe City.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Pacific-Grove/
If you want seaside splendor, look no further than quaint Pacific Grove, California. The coastal town is a popular base for Central Coast vacation rentals, and with good reason. Dubbed "Butterfly Town U.S.A," visitors flock here for the annual monarch butterfly migration, as well as for its stately Victorian manses and historic lighthouse. Sandwiched between tony Monterey and affluent Pebble Beach, Pacific Grove has a more vintage, homey feel than its more famous neighbors. John Steinbeck, Janis Joplin, and Frank Zappa all called it home, and a tour of the historic downtown harkens back to a bygone era.

With its location on the gorgeous Central Coast, Pacific Grove is a veritable outdoor paradise. From its famed Monarch Grove Sanctuary - best visited between November and February - to the dog-friendly and wheelchair-accessible Asilomar Beach to Point Pinos Lighthouse, built in 1855 and still the oldest continuously operated lighthouse on the West Coast, to its plethora of city parks large and small, visitors will find myriad ways to enjoy the beautiful coastal hills and blue ocean in this charming California town. So, grab a bike and head down the seaside bike trail!

Although in the cultural shadow of Monterey and Carmel-by-the-Sea, Pacific Grove still offers enough places of interest to keep visitors occupied. The historic downtown features a plethora of Victorian homes, most in great condition. The Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History boasts a killer whale skeleton, a native plant garden, and a Central Coast bird collection.

Pacific Grove remains a great base from which to explore the entire Central California Coast. Monterey is just over two miles to the south and boasts the Monterey Bay Aquarium as well as the Monterey Jazz Festival. Less than seven miles away lies picturesque Carmel-by-the-Sea, a town that is often on best of lists for its beach, romantic flavor, and art galleries. World-renowned Pebble Beach is also only minutes away. Head here in February for the annual AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am golf tourney and in April for the Pebble Beach Food & Wine fest.

So, whether it's whale watching from a private charter, admiring butterflies as they progress through life stages, or enjoying a nosh at a seaside eatery, this hidden gem is a great spot to explore the outdoors...and Vacasa offers an ever-growing selection of Pacific Grove vacation rentals to choose from!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Oceano/
Hitch up the dune buggy, because you're about the go off roading in Oceano, CA. After a day tracing sandy slopes, spying monarch butterflies, and horseback riding, you'll want a comfy, private place to rest your head. Our Ocean vacation rentals are just the ticket!

This small Central Coast beach town is home to just over 7,200 residents and neighbor to four other similarly-sized communities - the popular Pismo Beach, the quaint Grover Beach, the rustic Arroyo Grande, and Shell Beach. The closest major metropolitan area is Bakersfield, CA about 130 miles east. Oceano is easily accessed via US 101 or State Route 1.

Perhaps the area's biggest draw is its dunes, which are the only remaining off-road coastal variety in California. Of the 3,500 acres, about 2,000 are reserved for boisterous, bouncing buggies. March through September, this area is reduced due to the nesting season of the endangered snowy plover and California least tern. If you happen to visit in the autumn, look for these sea birds' chicks skittering in the surf - it's really cute.

Not so much into "cute" as you are "extreme?" Strap into your scrappy off-road ride and zoom on the dunes at the State Vehicular Recreational Area (SVRA). If you're visiting nearby Pismo Beach for its laidback vibe, mix things up with an Oceano ATV rental or guided tour. Each October, thousands congregate in this area for Huckfest, a truck-jumping event that boasts being the “gnarliest high-flying off-road action you will ever see.” Horseback riding and hiking on foot are also great ways to experience this unique ecosystem.

Early 20th century residents of these dunes included utopia-seekers, free spirits, and artists who believed they could channel the wild energy harnessed in this area. Perhaps you'll catch some of these frequencies as you sense the rev of an engine.

On the southern end of the dunes is the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center that focuses more on the delicate ecosystem than adventure. Follow one of its naturalists on a guided hike, enrich your mind with its educational programs and exhibits, and get inspired by its art gallery. The center also memorializes the largest film set ever built, that of Cecille B. DeMille's 1923 epic The Ten Commandments. Constructed on the area's dunes, it was eventually dismantled and, according to rumor, hidden in the sands. Fast-forward to 1983 when film buffs discovered the myth to be true and revealed the later named "Lost City of Cecil B. DeMille."

If you're not staying at one of our Oceano vacation rentals, there are other nearby communities offering delightful beach lodging and attractions. The closest are Grover Beach, with its charming atmosphere and annual concert series, and historic Arroyo Grande. No trip to this area is complete without a pilgrimage to the Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove in winter.

Find a new California point of view in this eclectic area while staying at one of our welcoming Oceano vacation rentals.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Palm-Springs/
Vintage glamour, sunshine, and swimming pools: there's no place quite like Palm Springs. Simultaneously known as the swinging playground for 1950s and '60s icons like Frank Sinatra and Elvis, a golfer's resort paradise, and a newly discovered mecca for LA hipsters, a visit to one of our Palm Springs vacation rentals is sure to leave an impression - and the certainty that this California destination is so much more than the sum of its parts.

If you haven't yet experienced Palm Springs, you're in for a pleasant surprise... and if your previous visits have been restricted to boutique hotels, the same rule applies.

Treat yourself to the privacy and space of a Palm Springs vacation rental, and find out what it's like to have a home away from home in this carefree destination.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Paso-Robles/
Our Paso Robles vacation rentals will inspire, delight, and enthrall you as much as this lovely city in California's Central Valley. Situated at the foothills of the Santa Lucia Mountains, Paso Robles, California, is one of the state's most desired holiday destinations.

First settled by the Salinan People, the Franciscans arrived in the 1700s, harnessing the power of the natural hot springs and planting the first vineyards in the area. Anglo Europeans arrived in the 1800s to farm the land and tourists soon followed - and have never stopped coming.

Today, Paso Robles is known for its verdant vineyards, olive groves, and hot springs. You can enjoy it all from one of our Paso Robles vacation rentals.

Hot springs are king here and you can still enjoy their therapeutic benefits at two locations. The River Oaks Hot Springs Spa has myriad rooms that offer relaxation in a beautiful setting. Franklin Hot Springs is still in its natural setting and boasts scenic wonder as well as native wildlife such as cinnamon teal ducks, bull frogs, and muskrats.

Built by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Hearst Castle is one of the most visited sites in town. This expansive historic estate, erected in the 1920s, showcases grand rooms and cottages boasting opulent furnishings as well as ancient art that rivals collections found in the world's great museums. Casa Del Mar is one of the most popular spots on the site due to its views of the Central Coast and its elaborate interiors.

The Paso Robles Pioneer Museum highlights the region's history and its founding fathers. Tour historical literature and displays dating back to the 1800s.

Wine is almost as popular as the hot springs, and when you stay in one of our Central Coast vacation rentals in Paso Robles, you'll be conveniently located to many excellent vineyards. With more than 200 wineries in the domain, you'll be sure to buy a case or two for family and friends back home. Proulx is known for its Cab Franc and Merlot. Head to Saxum Vineyards for award-winning blends of Syrah, Grenache, and Mourvèdre. Savor Napa-level Cabernet Sauvignon at L'Aventure Winery.

The Central Valley is resplendent in towns and sites that you'll want to explore.Visit the Montana de Oro State Park outside of San Luis Obispo, where golden flowers bloom in the spring, and guests can enjoy hiking up Valenica Peak or meandering along Spooner's Cove. Pismo Beach is 44 miles away and offers spots to surf as well as the Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove.

Soak away your troubles and tour world-class vineyards in lovely Paso Robles. Our Paso Robles vacation rentals are your gateway to this Central Valley town!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Pebble-Beach/
Golf fans and ocean lovers alike will love a stay at one of our Pebble Beach vacation rentals. This affluent community is home to the PGE Tour AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, and surrounded by stunning ocean vistas, old-growth Monterey pines, and your choice of Central California Coast attractions.

Easily accessible by scenic California Highway 1, Pebble Beach is nestled between the Monterey and Carmel Bays, just above sea level on the Monterey Peninsula. At under three hours south of San Francisco, an hour north of Big Sur, and next door to the nature habitat area Del Monte Forest, you might think you've slipped into a paradise while in Pebble Beach.

If you spend a lot of time on the green, perhaps you've aspired to play a few rounds at this popular golf destination. At less than 30 square miles in size, Pebble Beach has eight private and public 18-hole courses. From the Del Monte Golf Course (the oldest in operation west of the Mississippi) to Spyglass Hill Golf Course (one of the most challenging in the world!) you'll want to plan multiple visits to Pebble Beach just to cover them all.

Pebble Beach is largely residential (with a few famous folks in the area) and doesn't have sidewalks, so you'll want to have a car while visiting. That said, you'll find many outdoor points of interest while zipping around on your wheels.

Pack your camera and cruise on the 17 Mile Drive. Pay a visit to Pescadero Point to see its enchanting cypresses, dubbed “Ghost Trees.” Both Seal Rock and Bird Rock are viewable from 17 Mile Drive, and bring your binoculars to view their namesake marine life.

While part of your crew will enjoy the green, the rest of you can experience more Monterey Peninsula attractions. On the southern curve of the Monterey Bay, you'll find its biggest town of the same name. There's the Monterey Bay Aquarium on Cannery Row, which is a must-visit for both children and adults.

Have a ladies-only afternoon in Carmel-by-the-Sea on the southern side of the peninsula. Start with a light brunch at a cafe in Carmel Village before a round of shopping. You'll find that many merchants here welcome dogs into their boutiques, so don't leave your furry friend at home (or even back at one of our pet-friendly Pebble Beach vacation rentals!). Then, why not make reservations at one of the many fine restaurants in Carmel?

Even if you're not a seasoned hiker, take a day trip to Big Sur, even if it's just to drive the span of the Bixby Bridge (and snap a photo of the iconic view).

Pebble Beach is the premier California destination for a golf vacation or an unforgettable getaway by the sea. Enjoy it by staying at one of our luxurious Pebble Beach vacation rentals for the best experience of living like a local in this beautiful community.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Pismo-Beach/
Pismo Beach allows you to relive childhood memories at the shore while making new ones with your own family. It's about enjoying time together with a laid back vibe. This Central Coast beach town is where butterflies are free and surfers are happy. Our Pismo Beach vacation rentals will put you in the center of it all.

Though the name may sound familiar, non-Californians may not know where to spot Pismo Beach on the map. It's halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles and is the most prominent of the Five Cities Area of San Luis Obispo County (out of Arroyo Grande, Oceano, Grover Beach, and Shell Beach). Located along a narrow 13.5 square mile stretch on the San Luis Obispo Bay, with US 101 and State Route 1 (a.k.a. Highway 1) merging through most of Pismo Beach, getting in and out is super convenient.

While most beach vacations are taken in the summer, Pismo Beach offers attractions and events year round.

It's worthwhile to take a special trip between November and February to witness the massive monarch butterfly migration. These enchanting creatures take up temporary lodging among the area's eucalyptus trees. Concentrations of them can be observed at the Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove, a great family-friendly attraction.

In June, bring your binculars and claim a spot on the popular 1,200-foot long Pismo Pier for the annual visit from humpback whales. While you patiently wait for one of the massive marine mammals to breach the surface or even leap into the air, watch anglers fish for the occassional halibut.

Surfing in Pismo Beach is a pastime, being that it's on the California Coast. While sightings of the desired barrel waves that come with winter swells entice experienced surfers, beginners can train confidently with the aid of local guides. Standup paddle boarding, sea kayaking, and kite boarding are all nice alternatives for those eager to get out on the water.

Put on your clam diggers and learn how that pant style got its name as you hunt for the famous Pismo Clam. Once known as the "Clam Capital of the World," its beaches were dense with the vitamin-rich shellfish that have the potential to grow bigger than your hand. Due to overharvesting in the 1950s and hungry sea otters today, the Pismo Clam is a bit harder to find, but worth the dig. Make sure to obtain your salt-water fishing licences beforehand.

A serene visit with the butterflies and whales can be paired with a thrilling off-road romp. Rent or bring your own dune buggy to the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area just south of town. In the 1930s and 40s, this area was inhabited by mystics, writers, hermits, and other free spirits dubbed Dunites. It was believed that this unique ecosystem was a center of creative energy. Some level of high energy certainly thrives here today with the buzz and roar of buggies zooming over its slopes.

Frolic around the playground, walk your dog, or even host a wedding at Dinosaur Caves Park. All of these great attractions are within a few miles from our inviting Pismo Beach vacation rentals!

Just south of this admired Central California vacation destination are three little towns worth taking a spin through while staying at a Pismo Beach rental. The closest is Grover Beach, a tiny town with a big heart. Check out their Annual Sizzlin' Summer Concert Series and Farmer's Market. Next up is Arroyo Grande, slightly inland and hosting a Strawberry Festival each Memorial Day weekend. Finally, there's Oceano where you'll discover the dunes.

Thirteen miles northeast is San Luis Obispo, with the eclectic Madonna Inn along the way. Go wild on Instagram while meeting horses, shopping for souvenirs, and snacking on the historic inn’s Pink Champagne cake. The town of San Luis Obispo has a friendly collection of eateries and boutiques, plus cool vintage-style movie theaters like the Fremont and the Sunset Drive-In.

A short hop north on 101 gets you to Avila Beach and Avila Hot Springs, a must-visit spot to ease your tired clam-digging muscles under the shade of palm trees.

If you haven't already adopted the laid-back attitude California exudes, do so while staying at one of our Pismo Beach vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Rancho-Santa-Fe/
For the finest San Diego vacation rentals, look no further than beautiful Rancho Santa Fe! This highly desirable and exclusive community about 26 miles north of San Diego offers easy access to all the attractions of its larger neighbor to the south, but with a more secluded and scenic setting in the hills northeast of the city. At just about 11 miles from Escondido, the community of Rancho Santa Fe offers beautifully manicured landscaping, impeccably-groomed homes, and million-dollar views of the countryside below.

It's easy to see why celebrities and politicians of all stripes have long called Rancho Santa Fe their home. The area is peaceful and luxurious, but staying in a Rancho Santa Fe retreat still puts your family within easy reach of San Diego's excellent parks, museums, and - of course - the amazing Southern California shoreline. Right nearby, you'll have the Rancho Santa Fe Golf & Tennis Club, the picturesque beaches at Del Mar (some of the most scenic in all of San Diego County),  Torrey Pines State Reserve for hiking and wildlife viewing, the Rancho Santa Fe Historical Society for unique tour itineraries and exhibits, and popular eateries like Delicias and Mille Fleurs for when you work up an appetite.

And when you do want to venture out from your Rancho Santa Fe escape, there are so many attractions between here and San Diego, you'll have plenty of activities to choose from. Visit the world-famous San Diego Zoo (and it's Safari Park in La Jolla), take a tour around Coronado, hit the San Diego Museum of Art, or just spend your time relaxing the beach. Depending your getaway's list of amenities, you may not be able to tear yourself away from your private pool or patio with its breathtaking view of Rancho Santa Fe! For a top-shelf take on Southern California vacation rentals, consider gorgeous and exclusive Rancho Santa Fe, you won't regret it.
#Pathname:/usa/California/San-Luis-Obispo/
If you'll be exploring the Central California Coast, our selection of San Luis Obispo vacation rentals offer short drives to the shore, the vineyards, and much more!

This charming city is centrally located near US 101, about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles and only 10 miles east of the Pacific Ocean. Home to California Polytechnic State University and near the world-famous Paso Robles wine country, the town was established way back in 1772.

With roughly 13 square miles of verdant valleys, hardy Mediterranean flora, and easily accessible urban attractions, San Luis Obispo is a great home base for your Central Coast vacation. Start your day off with a Cali breakfast of avocados and eggs at one of many cafes in the pedestrian-friendly downtown. Dive into the city's past at the San Luis Obispo County Historical Museum and the nearly 250 year-old, still-functioning Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa. For a more offbeat experience, stroll by Bubblegum Alley...which is exactly as it sounds!

A few minutes' drive from downtown, you'll find the eccentric Madonna Inn, a baroque-inspired resort founded in 1958 that will please aspiring and professional photographers alike. If Art Deco and mid-century modern are more your style, catch a current release at the Fremont Theater or the retro-inspired Sunset Drive-In.

For both visitors and residents of Golden State, a road trip on Highway One is a must! Pick up the shoreline road near our San Luis Obispo vacation rentals and meet the Pacific at Morro Bay. On your way, you'll find El Chorro Regional Park for short hikes, birdwatching, and fishing. Once you reach the bay, grab local a seafood or fresh Mexican lunch for a beach picnic and take a moment to admire Morro Rock's peregrine falcons.

From Morro Bay, you could head north to San Simeon for the Piedras Blancas Elephant Seal Rookery, or a visit to the Hearst Castle on the publishing tycoon's La Cuesta Encantada estate. If you swing south, you'll find Montana de Oro State Park where you can windsurf, ride horses on the beach, or just take a stroll alongside grazing sandpipers. Part of your day-long adventure is in fact the scenic drive on top of seaside bluffs adorned with orange poppies and feathery pampus grass. It's a trip you'll never forget!

If you're visiting this area, chances are you came for the wines! Paso Robles (about 30 minutes away from downtown San Luis Obispo), thrives on 26,000 acres of vines and is known for its quintessentially California Zinfandels and Rhône-style vintages.

Don't know where to start? Book a guided tour so that everyone in your group can partake in tastings. If you have a designated driver, you could plan a fast and loose itinerary on the suggestions of friendly locals. Don't overlook the region's olive oils and honeys from bees that pollinate its almond groves. Then, finish your day with dinner at one of the top-notch restaurants in downtown Paso Robles.

While California is known for its world-class metropolises, it also holds a wealth of small urban gems like this one. When you choose to make your home base here, you'll find lovely San Luis Obispo vacation rentals you won't want to leave!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Santa-Barbara/
Located two hours north from Los Angeles on the longest east-west trending section of coastline on the West Coast is the beautiful city of Santa Barbara, a.k.a., "The American Riviera." The perfect spot for a Southern California Coast vacation rental, Santa Barbara is nestled in the gorgeous Ynez Valley and flanked on the south by the Pacific Ocean, Santa Barbara's climate - with 300 days of sunshine, annual rainfall of 15 inches, and average yearly temperature of 64 degrees - is reminiscent of its European counterpart. This stellar weather is linked to its east-west orientation, an alignment that moderates the ocean currents as they pass by. Also, mountains to the north and the Channel Islands 20 miles offshore also mitigate the weather. Whatever the reasons, the climate is great, making the area a magnet for vacationers seeking the perfect environment for outdoor activities.

But Santa Barbara isn't just about the weather. Though, like the French Riviera, it has a reputation as a playground for the wealthy, the average income for residents of Santa Barbara is only slightly higher than average California income. Families won't need a yacht or a limousine to enjoy the city's Zoological and Botanic Gardens, or the Museum of Art. Take the "Red Tile Walking Tour," a self-guided tour of many landmarks. (Factoid: A city ordinance makes it mandatory for buildings to comply with the dominant Mission theme of adobe architecture and red-tiled roofs).

There's also Santa Barbara's historic Stearns Wharf, California's oldest working wharf. Built in 1832 to serve cargo and passenger ships, the wharf is home today to shops, restaurants, and the Ty Warner Sea Center, an interactive marine facility that puts you up close and personal to the nearby marine life! And when you're done exploring, pull up a chair at one of the 283 eateries in the area that serve everything from Mexican to, of course, seafood. Considering Santa Barbara's wonderful climate, it's no surprise that there's plenty to do outdoors!

Right near your Santa Barbara beach cottage, there are four beaches in the area: East Beach, West Beach, Leadbetter and Butterfly. Hikers can choose from trails overlooking the ocean, trails starting at the crest of the Santa Ynez Mountains and in the Ynez Valley, and trails along the beach. Or, sign on to cruise where you can watch the sunset or whales frolic. Golfers: Santa Barbara has six public, 18 hole golf courses, four of which are within a half-hour of the city. Each exploits some natural feature of the area - ocean, mountain, or river - and all enjoy year-'round play afforded by the climate. And don't forget: Santa Barbara is wine country! There are a number of wineries within blocks of Downtown Santa Barbara where you can take a tour or tempt your palate with a tasting. A stay in a Santa Barbara vacation rental any time of year promises lots of fun in a year-'round great climate!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Sebastopol/
Sebastopol, CA is infused daily by cool fog drifting in from the Pacific. That makes for great pinot noirs, but there’s so much more than wine country here. Stay at one of our Sebastopol vacation rentals and find out what you’ve been missing.

As one of the boundaries of the Green Valley, a Sonoma County American Viticultural Area where over 100 wineries take root in the soil, Sebastopol is about 50 miles north of the San Francisco Bay Area and 100 miles west of Sacramento. Locals call this area West County, describing its closer proximity to the coast in relation to the more heavily toured Sonoma Valley to the east. Weary workers from nearby metropolitan areas are lured here by the embrace of the sun, the chill of the fog, and the promise of experiencing the terroir through remarkable food and wine.

Being the foggiest region of Sonoma County, Sebastopol once thrived on apple and plum groves. Today grape vines have taken over with pinot noir ruling and chardonnay, gewürztraminer, and zinfandel close behind.

Start your tasting tour at one of the premier Green Valley wineries, Dutton Estate. The family of this winery started with growing apples in the 1920s. DeLoach Vineyards features the area's mainstays as well as zippy zinfandels with a focus on small batches and biodynamic farming. Miramar Estate also utilizes biodynamic organic farming. For a switch from rich pinots and chardonnays, partake in the crisp, sparkling cuvées and bruts at Iron Horse Vineyards.

There are so many great tasting rooms within a 10-mile radius of our Sebastopol vacation rentals, it might be hard to know where to begin! Have a professional escort you through the narrow country roads. Try California Rivers Wine Tours or the luxe Executive Charters & Limousine that will happily chauffeur your Sonoma wine country wedding party. Go for one that will pick you up at your Sebastopol vacation home if you can.

Before you head out on your winery road trip, fuel up on local fare at the many fantastic Sebastopol restaurants. Start with a fortifying brunch at Hole in the Wall Restaurant, serving California comfort food. Savor an Instagram-worthy meal at French Garden, which serves produce harvested daily.

Sebastopol has a modest population of under 8,000, but it sure isn't a sleepy bedroom community. Nightlife and live music are easily found. Go to Aubergine Vintage Emporium and Cafe - a thrift shop by day and a pumping club by night under the name 755 After Dark. Get dinner and drinks, then get down at Hopmonk Tavern. French Garden also has a music schedule.

Ready for dinner? Peter Lowell's Restaurant offers California-inspired Italian cuisine from local ingredients. To match your dessert wine, pick up sweets at Sonoma Chocolatiers. Then again, you can always swing by the year-round Sebastopol Farmer's Market for fresh fruits, veggies, meats, and cheeses to fix a fine feast at your Sonoma County vacation rental.

Sebastopol remembers its history by hosting the "sweetest little fair in Sonoma County," the Gravenstein Apple Festival every August and the Apple Blossom Festival each April.

Take a break from wine with the many Northern California breweries in the cute towns dotting US 101. A short seven to eight mile drive east of Sebastopol is Santa Rosa. Go to Russian River Brewing Company for hoppy ales and barrel-aged micros (be sure to get in line early for a table). Further south on 101 is the community of Petaluma where you'll find Lagunitas Brewing Company and the taproom at Petaluma Hills Brewing Company.

For a unique family-friendly Sonoma County attraction, go to Rancho Obi-Wan, known as a mecca for Star Wars fans. In between Santa Rosa and Petaluma is the Graton Resort and Casino where retirees congregate before slot machines - so save up your dollar bills and take a chance at the jackpot.

Need to ease your feet into the sea? Just 15 miles west of our Sebastopol vacation rentals quietly lies Bodega Bay, a charming coastal town where your ocean fix will be fulfilled. Explore tide pools at Doran Beach or play a round of golf on The Links at Bodega Harbour.

Take a scenic drive on California State Route 116 across Green Valley to Guerneville, which sits along the Russian River. Rent a kayak to explore robust sections of the river or hike through Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve.

Wherever you roam throughout the Northern California Coast, let our Sebastopol vacation rentals be your home away from home!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Santa-Cruz/

#Pathname:/usa/California/Sonoma/
Imagine yourself surrounded by award-winning wineries nestled between the Napa Valley to the east and the Northern California Coast to the west in one of our deluxe Sonoma vacation rentals. This hub of eco-tourism boasts a popular, historic plaza right in the center of town. The capital of "slow culture," Sonoma is an idyllic place to take in the sights of rolling hills lined with flourishing vines, visit an outdoor cafe with a carafe of wine, or just walk along the cobblestones on a perfect sunny day.

Considered responsible for igniting California’s wine industry in the 19th century, Sonoma county is endowed with one of the most diverse vine-friendly terrains in the country. From the dry hills of the Carneros appellation on its eastern border to the home of old vine Zinfandels in the central Russian River Valley, and finally to the wind-beaten headlands of the Sonoma Coast, this New World wine region is truly enigmatic.

Within a few miles from your Sonoma lodging, you can sample varietals at more than 70 wineries throughout Sonoma county, including award-winning reds at Kenwood Vineyards, those from ancient vines at Ravenswood, and the sustainably farmed vinos of Sebastiani.

If you know what you like, buy a bottle, a wedge of Cowgirl Creamery brie, and charcuterie to enjoy on site at some of the best picnic-worthy wineries such as Gloria Ferrer (specializing in sparkling only), Kunde, and Cohn.

Having a designated driver willing to take you on a Sonoma wine country tour is a priority, but purchasing a professional guide to take the wheel allows everyone in your group to participate in the fun. Consider Valley Wine Tours (ask for Bob), Terrific Tours, or the Sonoma Valley Wine Trolley. Ask if they’ll pick you up right from any of our Sonoma vacation rentals. For a one-of-a-kind adventure, take a hot air balloon ride high above the vineyards.

The only thing better than discovering a new favorite Sonoma wine is experiencing it with a phenomenal meal. With Northern California’s Mediterranean climate, fresh produce and healthy livestock are abundant. Award-winning chefs invite locals and tourists alike to share in the bounty!

You can’t go wrong by picking a place at random in Sonoma Plaza, the small city’s downtown square. Reservations are best, however, for a full dining experience at such gems as The Girl & the Fig and Harvest Moon Cafe.

If wine isn't your thing, Carneros Brewing Company has a taproom that is open daily, as well as a beer garden for sharing snacks and pints on a relaxing afternoon. Sonoma Springs Brewing Company is a great spot as well. The town is also a hub of unique stores, artisan markets, and art galleries.

Feel the need to burn off all those liquid calories? Outdoor adventurers can take a canoe trip on the nearby Russian River, take a tour of a bee farm, or spend the day in scenic Jack London State Park. At Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, you can hike or horseback ride through beautiful oak and chaparral forests, right past waterfalls and peaceful streams.

From Sonoma, day trips can include San Francisco, the Point Reyes National Seashore, or even the sleepy seaside towns of Gualala and Bodega Bay. And when you get back to your Sonoma vacation rental, you can make dinner and sip souvenir wine in your very own kitchen.

Surrounded by redwoods, wineries, and peaceful hiking and biking trails, Vacasa's Sonoma vacation rentals are in the center of numerous California activities and attractions to pick from.

Just under 30 miles away are olive orchards in Ojai where you can sample exquisite oils, then spend the day hiking among cottonwoods and poppies in Rose Valley Falls in Los Padres National Forest.

For a taste of Hollywood without all the bustle, head 45 miles inland to Santa Clarita, a popular filming site for hundreds of television programs and movie sequences. The nearby community of Newhall retains its frontier-style appeal for Western movies - complete with a bison paddock. Each September, Newhall hosts an all-inclusive powwow.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Avon/
Just 13 mins (about 10 miles) from Vail, its more opulent counterpart to the east, Avon, Colorado is located along the Eagle River. Referred to by the indigenous Ute Indians as "the shining mountain," what began as prized hunting grounds for the Indians became, at the hands of settlers, an agricultural center for the production of lettuce. In order to serve markets months after the growing season, farmers would load railroad cars packed with ice from the Minturn Ice House. By 1972, however, neighboring Vail had become a world center for skiing, and Avon likewise made the transition from produce to winter and summer vacation rental fun!

Given Avon Colorado's proximity to two great ski resorts, Vail and Beaver Creek, the endless opportunities for winter sports - skiing, boarding, skating, etc. - go without saying. But summer offers its own treasure trove of activities during your vacation. Not only are there myriad hiking and biking trails in the area, why not go horseback riding or rafting on the Eagle River? Get a bird's eye view of the beautiful landscape with and exciting turn at paragliding. There are also numerous spas and health clubs in the area as well. In addition, enjoy access to the year-round amenities of the Avon Rec. Center ($14 a day pass) and Nottingham Lake for paddle boating and fishing.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Beaver-Creek/
Just 13 minutes (about 9 miles southwest of Vail), Beaver Creek was another brainchild of Vail's founder, Peter Seibert who envisioned Beaver Creek as a venue for the 1976 Olympics. It was, however, his successor - oil tycoon, Harry Bass - who brought the idea to fruition in 1980. In 1989 it hosted the World Ski Championship, thereby cementing its reputation as a go-to resort for world-class skiers. Beaver Creek Resort is, in fact, three resorts in one: Arrowhead, Bachelor Gulch, and Beaver Creek Village.

Nestled against the slopes of Beaver Creek Mountain, the resort also boasts a golf course designed by the renowned Robert Trent Jones Jr. Voted "World's Best Resort" by Travel and Leisure in 2012, Beaver Creek's motto is: "Not exactly roughing it." In summer, you can get a birds-eye view of the landscape from a ride up the chairlifts or attend one of the many festivals sponsored by Beaver Creek which include "Blues, Brews and BBQ" in May, concerts at the Beaver Creek Music experience in June, and the USA Pro Cycling Challenge in August. In Beaver Creek, you're smack dab in the middle of the Rockies, so the hiking, fishing, and sight-seeing possibilities are endless!
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Blue-River/
A great pick for a Vail / Beaver Creek vacation rental, is peaceful and charming Blue River, Colorado. This location offers a quiet, National Forest-surrounded landscape only a small distance away from it's bustling resort town neighbor Breckenridge to the north. You'd probably guess skiing is a popular pastime around Blue River (and you'd be right), but the summer offers just as many things to do! World class fly fishing can be found right on the actual Blue River - known by the locals as "The Blue." From the Upper Blue north of Breckenridge to the tail water below Lake Dillon, this river is home to an abundance of trout - some up to 24-inches long!

But don't feel like you need to rush out and get some fishing gear and waders as soon as you hit town, because nice weather activities in and around Blue River don't start and end with fishing! There's hiking and biking scenic trails past wildflowers, lakes, and waterfalls, swimming and boating on Lake Dillon, whitewater rafting The Blue, or even just relaxing on the deck of your cozy Blue River vacation home. With over 300 days of sun per year, you'll be able to spend a lot of time outdoors here, even if you need to wear a warm hat and scarf along with your sunglasses.

Of course, one of the most popular attractions near Blue River is Breckenridge Ski Resort. Like Vail and Beaver Creek, this resort attracts skiers from all over the world. Breckenridge boasts over 600 acres of daily groomed trails and almost 3000 acres of total skiable terrain. In addition, right in your backyard around Blue River, you'll have access to plenty of trails for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. You can even try ice fishing on Lake Dillon!

Even though you'll have a kitchen in your Blue River vacation home, no one says you have to use it for anything more than making coffee in the morning and heating up leftovers. While most of the dining options are in Breckenridge, it's only about a five mile drive to all of those eateries. And if you're already in the area skiing, you'll have your pick of restaurants to choose from on the way home. A stop at Salt Creek Steakhouse will result in succulent crab cakes and cowboy rib eye steaks, or hit up the Motherloaded Tavern for your fill of comfort food favorites like mac and cheese and fried chicken while you listen to live music. But for those that do like to cook, a stop at the grocery store is all that's needed for a home cooked meal back at your charming Blue River abode.

At less than a two hour drive from Denver, a stay at a Blue River vacation rental makes a ski getaway, annual fishing trip, or just a retreat with friends and family a memorable, fun-filled vacation experience.

The town of Eagle is bustling with an active Main Street, a renovated shopping district, and plenty of opportunities to let loose and enjoy yourself. This is a community-oriented town, and they will eagerly invite you to join in with their favorite past times, festivals, and celebrations all year round.

"Active" is the verb of Eagle: Bike to Work Day, Yoga in the Park, a quirky bowling alley and, of course, countless trails for Nordic skiing, biking, or cross country running make this a town of movement. Our Eagle vacation rentals will make the perfect resting place for you and your family and/or friends after a busy day bustling about.

A typical day in Eagle would include a visit to one of the local eateries in town, such as Yeti's Grind or Red Canyon Cafe, after a relaxing yoga session at Yoga on Broadway. If it's winter time, you're a car or shuttle ride away from Beaver Creek Ski Resort and Vail Ski Resort, both offering phenomenal terrain, lessons for all ages and levels, and an enthusiastic atmosphere. If it's summer time, hike up one of the many trail heads that start right in town such as Mayer or Abrams Gulch, take a drive to Sylvan Lake State Park, or knock a ball around the green at the Eagle Ranch Golf Club.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/East-Vail/
After snaking downward over 2, 200 feet from the 10,000 foot summit of Vail Pass, I-70 delivers you into a beautiful and pristine community. Welcome to East Vail - the gateway to Vail Valley. A little rougher around the edges than its glamorous neighbor 5 minutes to the west, it offers the traveler a truly alpine experience. And for skiers, East Vail has a unique challenge not to be found in the smartly manicured runs of Vail Resort down the road.

Majestic and dangerous, the snow-covered caps of the East Vail Chutes are one of the best kept secrets of skiers worldwide. They are an exhilarating and dangerous (check for avalanche conditions) backcountry temptation for more advanced skiers looking for the proverbial unbeaten path. In summer, those same slopes that were dotted with intrepid skiers are home instead to cascading waterfalls. East Vail is less developed, and that's its greatest virtue. Everywhere are the unspoiled advantages that come with the natural beauty of the Vail Valley.

Hiking is, of course, very popular. Among the trails are: Big Horn Creek - length: 3.6 miles one way (moderately difficult); Booth Creek - length: 6 miles one way (difficult); Deluge Creek - length: 4 miles one way and, Deluge Creek Trail: length: 4 miles one way (difficult).

And if you want to tour the area on four wheels, consider driving some of the "San Juan Skyway" - a 236-mile loop through the San Juan Mountains and the towns of Mancos, Durango, Telluride, and Dolores.

In ski season, Purgatory, the Durango Mountain Resort, about an hour northeast, has both skiing and snowboarding, with an annual snowfall of over 21 feet. In summer, this same resort is home to disc golf, hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding.

Special events that draw visitors to Mancos include an Open Art Studio Tour in June, a Farmers Market that runs June through September on Thursday afternoons, Friday night summer gallery walks, and fall balloon rides. The Sugar Pine Ranch motorcycle rally is also every Labor Day weekend and to all of this you can also add a small, but vibrant downtown with galleries, eateries, a coffee house, and the Mancos Valley Distillery, producers of small batch, hand-crafted rum! When you leave your Mancos vacation home, one thing is sure - you'll have many options!
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Mountain-Village/
Luxurious and upscale, Vacasa's Mountain Village vacation rentals offer a getaway for groups of family and friends looking to experience the warm hospitality and the surrounding recreation that Colorado has to offer.

At 9,545 feet above sea level, Mountain Village is the base location of the Telluride Ski Resort, on the slopes above Telluride, Colorado. It's a six mile shuttle ride or drive from the regional airport, but there's no need for a car while you're here. Guests of our Mountain Village vacation rentals will enjoy quick access to the gondola system, offering a scenic 13 minute ride from Mountain Village to town for free. From the gondola to the town's free bus system, transportation is easy here.

Teaming with recreation, eateries, and shops, this mini-town is almost completely self-sustaining, and offers ample opportunities for guests to experience the best that Southwest Colorado has to offer.

Our Mountain Village vacation rentals offer first-class access to one of Colorado's most popular ski resorts. Some of these Telluride area lodges are even ski-in, ski-out, where guests only have to put on their snow gear, click on their skis or boards, and go! The base of Chair 4 offers access to most of Telluride's extensive, varied terrain, and guests need only walk a short distance to get to the Adult Magic Carpet ski lift and the top of Chair 1 for newbies.

The gondola connects Mountain Village Center to Town Plaza Station for guests who may be in Mountain Village but slightly away from the base of the slopes.

Mountain Village is also home to several winter sports shops that offer rentals, repairs, and merchandise, plus the main building for the Telluride Ski & Snowboard School, ticket sales, and the Kid's Magic Carpet. Private lessons, child care, adaptive sports, and ski bike classes are all available to guests and are supervised by enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff.

Mountain Village in wintertime is a snowy wonderland filled with people from all over the world. Guests will find ice skating and a community firepit in the Plaza, plus many eateries and shops.

Take the kids to family-friendly spots like Hot Diggity Dog for amazing hot dogs loaded with toppings, Crazy Elk for pizza, and the Sweet Life for candy and ice cream (or a fun T-shirt!).

Those not traveling with children will enjoy adult-friendly spots like Tomboy Tavern for apres ski cocktails and beer and monster-size hamburgers while you watch the busy slopes and listen to multiple languages and accents floating about you.

When the snow melts, our Mountain Village vacation rentals transform from the hub of activity to a removed retreat with a fine balance between activity and relaxation.

Take it easy with a visit to the Market on the Plaza during the day or a Movie on the Lawn at dusk. Set the kids up with the "Gravity Play Combo", including bungee trampolines, a rope course, and Water Walkers (human-sized bubble-like pool floats). Try your hand at bouldering Adventure Rock.

Bikers will adore Mountain Village for its access to great trails varying in degrees of difficulty - just put your bike on the gondola rack and head out. Fantastic views and a gorgeous landscape are guaranteed no matter where you end up.

Try disc golf on Double Cabins, or regular golf at the Telluride Golf Course. If you enjoy water, visit Elk Pond for a romantic kayak or canoe paddle, a waterside picnic, or a bit of fishing.

Don't forget your hiking shoes - the San Juan Mountains in which this scenic hamlet sits are covered in trails for all kinds of hikers, for those seeking anything from a casual stroll through town to climbing a local fourteener.

Our Mountain Village vacation homes make for excellent Telluride festival lodging, starting in May with Telluride MountainFilm and ending in September with the Telluride Film Festival which both include showings, lectures, and meet-and-greets right in Mountain Village.

A mountain escape full of down-to-earth hospitality with upscale glamour, perfect for groups of friends or a family escaping to a scenic, magical place of wonder and high places, these Mountain Village vacation rentals will inspire, center, and connect you.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Minturn/
Choosing a Minturn vacation rental means choosing charm and history without compromising on convenience. As the oldest town in Vail Valley, Minturn offers a lovely, slower-paced alternative to its glamorous neighbors like Beaver Creek or Vail, but is still quite close to world-class ski resorts and year-round outdoor adventure. Minturn's charms include antique stores, galleries, and great local restaurants. After a day of skiing, stop for margaritas at the Minturn Saloon or stop by the Sticky Fingers cafe on the way to the mountain for a latte and a cinnamon roll. The winter months find skiers and snowboarders enjoying the historic charm just ten minutes from Vail proper, and the summer finds visitors flocking to the weekly Minturn Farmer's Market or to the Eagle River for kayaking and fishing. This old Western town has historic heft and a laid-back appeal you may not find in all parts of the Vail Valley, along with all the amenities and convenience of a resort town. When you're looking for an unconventional spot to book a Vail Valley vacation home, consider the charms of our Minturn rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Mt-Crested-Butte/
It’s no mystery why Mt. Crested Butte vacation rentals are some of the most sought-after in Colorado – with superb skiing and snowboarding, beautiful hiking and mountain biking trails, back country, plus all the incredible rivers and creeks available for rafting and swimming, it’s hard to stay away from this beautiful area.

When it comes to the Rocky Mountains’ finest outdoor offerings, it doesn’t get much better than Crested Butte—no matter what time of year! While Colorado is known for its incredible ski areas, Crested Butte Mountain Resort is special because it’s a bit smaller and boasts some of the best powder shredding, stunning panoramic views, and tons of variety for beginner to advanced skiers.

Staying here means you’re as close as possible to everything this area has to offer, even if you aren't a skier. Take a hike to the summit (your muscles will certainly burn afterwards), go tubing, or even snowshoeing - every family member will have a great time! Mt. Crested Butte vacation rentals have the best peak views around, and there are so many choices for hiking trails, mountain biking, and even swimming and rafting nearby.

Mt. Crested Butte may be a small ski town, but it has everything you need to enjoy your vacation, with a few wonderful restaurants, bars, spas, and some truly amazing ski-in/ski-out vacation rentals!

The town of Mt. Crested Butte proper is tucked directly at the base of the ski resort, so you can't get any closer to the lifts. Three miles south is the similarly named but separate (and larger) historic town of Crested Butte. This larger town center offers many more boutiques, dining options, and happy hours, along with its own selection of fantastic Crested Butte vacation rentals that put you a bit closer to the vibrant heart of town.

Luckily, in Colorado, many of the incredible vistas and ski areas are within a few hours of each other. The surrounding Gunnison Valley is stunning, with many different mountains for your climbing craving, including the Gunnison National Forest, beautiful Black Canyon, and Hartman Rocks Recreation Area nearby.

The bigger ski resorts such as Vail, Copper Mountain, and Keystone, plus the diverse and urban city of Denver, are all within a four to five-hour drive. Take a night or two away from your base in Mt. Crested Butte to explore everything Colorado has to offer!

Our ever-growing selection of Mt. Crested Butte vacation rentals truly have it all for anyone in your crew.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Rico/
Visitors looking to for a laid-back alternative to the glitz and glam of many resort towns will enjoy a Colorado vacation rental in secluded, peaceful Rico. Nestled among the high mountains in the San Juan National Forest, Rico offers a small-town hideaway that's hard to beat.

Located about 28 miles from Telluride, and about 55 miles from Mancos, this scenic small town is truly hidden away from the noise of its larger counterparts.

Active folks will thrive in Rico's rich natural environment. Surrounded by forests and peaks, clear streams and steep cliffs, the outdoor enthusiast will have a hard time sitting still. The Lizard Head Wilderness is an astounding stretch of terrain perfect for hikers and mountain bikers - an excursion in the fall means coming face to face with some truly gorgeous colors.

Road bikers will love the challenge of biking Lizard Head Pass, a 28 mile paved road between Rico and Telluride, while hunters and fisherman will find Rico's nearby forests and streams teaming with game (proper licensing and fees apply).

Backcountry adrenaline seekers won't be able to resist tracks of deep powder in the winter time. And if backcountry isn't your scene, Nordic skiing and snowshoeing trails are endless. Alpine skiers will enjoy nearby access to the Telluride Ski Resort for varied terrain and an excellent customer-oriented experience.

Thoughtful introverts will particularly love our Rico vacation rentals for the town's single main street and handful of historical buildings. Visit the Rico Historical Museum, or wander through the nearby forests and see what you can find - a handful of old mining structures still stand, perfect for photo opportunities.

Nature lovers will enjoy the abundant wildlife. This is a great place to bird watch, with around 300 species of birds living in the San Juan forest region, from meadow larks and bluebirds to bald and golden eagles. Watch the mountainsides for bighorn sheep, and keep your eyes peeled for pika and marmots on your hikes.

When you stay in a Rico vacation rental, you're saying yes to a mountain experience that will truly refresh your senses and open your eyes to the natural beauty of Colorado.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Pagosa-Springs/
Experience the glorious Western slope of Colorado when you stay in rustic Pagosa Springs. Tucked into the upper basin of the San Juan Mountains along the Colorado Sunbelt, Pagosa Springs is "simplicity on a grand scale" - this is a resort town in disguise. Our Pagosa Springs vacation rentals will lead you to a land hardly touched: Pagosa Springs is surrounded by over 3 million acres of national forest, wilderness preserve, and native tribes' lands, leaving the surrounding landscape greatly undisturbed. The luxury of this Western Slope destination is in more than just the fabulous, man-made accommodations: it's in the natural beauty that thrives right outside every threshold.

The geothermal hot springs is what draws so many visitors to this little town. The world's deepest geothermal hot spring, or "Mother Spring" resides here, offering its warm, mineral-laced waters to the bodies of weary travelers. The Southern Utes used the phrase "Pagosah", or "healing waters" (hence the town's name), and these springs have long been reputed to have therapeutic benefits. If you're looking for a place to seriously unwind, then a Pagosa Springs vacation rental is the best choice for you. Pagosa offers three soaking locations of various sizes - from a single large pool, to 23 smaller pools of varying temperature. All three hot springs offer full-service spas - treat yourself to some serious pampering!

Take advantage of all the wild space around you to do some major exploration. Like most Colorado towns, this is a place bustling with activity and made with the outdoorsy in mind. Pagosa Springs is a great place to try something new and different: try whitewater rafting in the San Juan River in May and June, and tubing/floating in July and August. Always had an interest in rock climbing, or paddle boarding? Ever taken a hot air balloon ride, or seen the Continental Divide? Pagosa is the place to try! Classic summer activities like hiking, ATV and Jeep tours, and mountain biking are a must. Interested in learning about the wildlife? Stop by the Rocky Mountain Wildlife Park, a facility dedicated to the education and rehabilitation of Colorado wildlife. If wintertime is more your speed, Wolf Creek Ski Resort is just 30 minutes up the road for alpine and cross country skiing. And who would say no to a guided dog-sled tour?

Downtown Pagosa Springs is a hub of activity due to the proximity of the soaking pools, and there are plenty of art galleries, shops, and dining options to keep every guest entertained. Shop at the Lantern Dancer or Home Again, and visit Shy Rabbit Contemporary Arts for art collections and professional workshops. Want to head outside of Pagosa Springs? Try visiting Durango and Silverton for mining and railroad history, or Mesa Verde National Park for archaeological sites. And when it's time to eat, you'll have a myriad of choices from Riff Raff Brewing Company to Side Street Sushi. Our Pagosa Springs vacation rentals will take you away from the ordinary to the extraordinary and beyond - your wild haven and rejuvenating retreat awaits.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Snowmass-Village/
The allure of the Rocky Mountains is fully expressed in the charming nature of our Snowmass Village vacation rentals in beautiful Colorado. Surrounded by peaks and valleys, this ski resort village is a self-contained, family-friendly resort that offers a little something for each member of your varied group. From intense glade skiing and park riding to hot air balloons and photography, our Snowmass Village condos and getaways are the launch pad for adventure.

Located nine miles from downtown Aspen, and operated under Aspen/Snowmass Resort, the Snowmass ski resort boasts over 3,300 acres of varied terrain. Expert and local skiers/riders flock to Snowmass for its intense rides in the Burnt Mountain Glades and The Cirque, and park enthusiasts love the runs in the Snowmass Park and Superpipe. First and foremost, however, is this mountain's accessibility to all levels. In addition to the exceptional ski/ride school and friendly service, there are nine on-mountain restaurants to unbuckle and regroup while enjoying remarkable views. Sign your children up for ski lessons and child care services at the Treehouse Kids Adventure Center, while you ski and ride at your own pace (with breaks for adult beverages), or take an adult lesson!

Extreme mountain enthusiasts will want to sign up for First Tracks - a run with the Snowmass staff first thing in the morning, before the lifts are even running. Families will thoroughly enjoy Ullr Nights, every Friday night of the season. The celebration of the Norse god of snow includes some mountain tubing, winter eats, and ice skating.

Snowmass offers guests various opportunities to experience the mountain in the winter. Strap on the snowshoes for a naturalist-guided snowshoe tour (also available as a ski/snowboard tour) to experience Snowmass as an ecosystem. Try out Nordic skiing, or visit the Ice Age Discovery Center to learn about the recent archaeological discovery at Ziegler Reservoir.

This Colorado town winds down in the summertime, transitioning from a high-intensity ski resort to a peaceful, local haven. When you stay in a Snowmass Village condo with Vacasa, you'll have access to all the fun. Late spring through the fall mean warm days spent outside: biking Snowmass - one of the summer highlights for locals and visitors alike - hiking the alpine meadows, or strolling through Snowmass Village and downtown Aspen. Take an early morning hot air balloon ride and watch the sun kiss the tops of the Rockies, or plan a trail ride with a local stable. The Snowmass Recreation Center offers year-round athletic classes, a pool, and a rock climbing gym - or try your hand at outdoor climbing! Parents looking for an opportunity to take a couple's hike/bike ride will love the kids' day camps offered for a range of age groups.

There's always something to do in Snowmass Village - there are free concerts every Thursday night in the summer, bonfires and s'mores during Valhalla Nights, and the Jazz Aspen Labor Day Festival. While Aspen is close at hand for more activities, Snowmass is its own entity, boasting a grocery store, and even a bowling alley!

Though known for its outdoor, adventurous lifestyle, this luxurious Colorado town isn't just about skiing/riding, the biking, the hiking, or even of the surroundings. It's the feeling of connection - to the mountains, to the people, to the land - that makes a stay in a Snowmass Village vacation rental a truly special one.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/West-Vail/
Nothing grows like a good idea, and West Vail is proof. In 1962, after WWII ski trooper Peter Seibert decided to build a replica of the ski resort he saw in Zermatt, Switzerland. The product of his efforts - Vail Resort - became so successful, it had to expand in both directions to accommodate the flood of winter sports enthusiasts. West Vail became the western edge of that expansion.

Though it's mostly residential, West Vail is actually larger than Vail Village and still just a short drive or free shuttle ride away from the world famous resort. It's a great place to stay, not only because it's a little less hectic than Vail Village, it's ideally situated to exploit both the sunshine from the north, and the alpine vistas from the south.

From the beginning, Vail has been, of course, mostly about the snow. Surrounded by White River National Forest, Vail Resort is actually leased from the U.S. Forest Service. From a base elevation of 8,120 feet, Vail Mountain soars to a height of 11, 570 feet. The mountain's 5,289 ski-able acres of diverse difficulty are accessed by three base areas: Lionshead, Vail Village, and Golden Peak, each of which has its own distinctive, state of the art gondola or chairlift system to whisk skiers and snowboarders quickly to their chosen destination. And there are plenty of other winter activities in and around West Vail like snowshoeing, ice climbing, snowmobiling, dog sledding, or just a nice, tranquil sleigh ride. Or, try the slopes at one of the neighboring resorts, like Beaver Creek, or Ski Cooper. Aspen, Winter Park, and Breckenridge are other venues accessible by car. And that's just winter.

In summer, the area around West Vail and Vail is a magnet for hikers (a popular hike is one around Booth Falls) and backpackers, anglers, cyclists, horseback riders, climbers, kayakers, and canoe-ers. How about a hot air balloon ride or just a leisurely ride on a gondola with breathtaking views of the Rockies all about you! Though West Vail does have a few eateries where you can grab everything from a sandwich to sushi, the gold standard for dining is just a few minutes to the east in Vail Resort where you'll have your choice of 23 restaurants catering to diverse tastes from haute cuisine to a quick snack.

#Pathname:/usa/Florida/Key-West/
For an island that is only two miles long and four miles wide, you'd think it would be a quiet place, demanding long trips outside the immediate area to reach attractions, good food, and historical sites. However, that's far from the case when you book one of our Key West vacation rentals! With a vibrant arts culture, a variety of opportunities for outdoor adventures, and a welcoming small-town attitude, Key West promises a unique and memorable vacation.

When you book a stay in one of our Florida vacation rentals in Key West, you're not just booking a vacation; you're booking an experience!

Our Key West vacation rentals are on the last island of the Florida Keys chain, about 160 miles from Miami and 98 miles from Key Largo. Whether you chose to arrive to this interesting island via plane, ferry, or car, the first sight of the expansive Atlantic Ocean promises to take your breath away. With its vibrant wildlife, you may even be lucky enough to spot a few dolphins splashing around and welcoming you to Key West!

Although the island is relatively small, the number of attractions are vast and varied! Key West has a diverse arts and history culture, including plenty of galleries, delicious restaurants, and landmarks that are as unique as the Keys themselves. The Hemingway Home, located in Old Key West, is a historical treat for guests who enjoy literature (and six-toed cats). With look-out towers and detailed exhibits of the wrecking business, the Shipwreck Museum is definitely worth a visit.

Other points of interest on the island include the Southernmost Point, and Wyland's Whaling Wall, a gorgeous mural of some of Key West's local aquatic residents. Key West has a laid-back attitude, but its night life isn't lacking! Let loose on Duval Street, starting in Mallory Square with its famous Sunset Celebration and working your way down the main drag to the (in)famous Sloppy Joe's.

Feeling hungry after a long day full of excitement and adventure? Our Key West lodging is conveniently close to many dining options, including restaurants like Help Yourself, an organic cafe and juice bar, and Square One, a fine-dining establishment.

With so many diverse outdoor activities near our Key West vacation rentals, it might be difficult to decide where to start. However, one thing is for sure - water is Key West's playground! Book a charter with Sunset Sail Key West and admire the wildlife or catch one of those famous Florida sunsets. With early morning sunrise cruises, starlit float trips, snorkeling, and themes like "Cruise Concert" and "Wine and Wind" at dusk, there's something for everyone!

While sandy beaches are not as common in the Keys due to the reef barrier, there are a few favorites that are worth a visit, including Smathers Beach, Ft. Zachary Taylor State Park, and the Dry Tortugas National Park, home to epic sandy beaches and historic Fort Jefferson.

The natural beauty of Key West has been preserved thanks to the recent emphasis placed on ecotourism. With options for kayaking, scuba diving, or snorkeling, you'll be able to admire wildlife in its natural habitat while helping conservation efforts to maintain the Keys. View the reef up close with a trip on a glass-bottom boat, or try a dolphin-viewing charter!

A vacation destination that combines the modern conveniences and comforts of home with a growing environmental awareness (and a memorable nightlife scene!), this beautiful island offers a glimpse into all that Florida has to offer. Plan a visit to one of our Key West vacation rentals for a memorable trip full of relaxation, exploration, and unforgettable experiences.

#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/Atlanta/
Sweet Georgia peaches, lazy days at Turner Field, the Coca-Cola factory, and Civil War battlegrounds - these are just four things that come to mind when one thinks of Atlanta, and the many attractions that abound when you plan a stay in one of our Atlanta vacation rentals!

The capital city of Georgia sits in the north of the state, flanked by the Appalachian Mountains and the Chatahootchee River. With nearly half a million residents, the city has a diverse and unique populace that embodies Southern hospitality at its finest. The Creek and Cherokee tribes were the first settlers; Europeans arrived in the early 1800s. Reconstruction brought unprecedented growth and prosperity, making the city a national transportation and education hub. Today, Atlanta enjoys a reputation for good food, good drink, great art, and culture, and our Atlanta vacation rentals provide the perfect base from which to tour and admire this bustling metropolis.

As the largest urban center in the state, Atlanta boasts myriad attractions from the high-brow to the recreational. As the international headquarters of Coca-Cola, visitors can expect an effervescent experience at The World of Coke. Tour the two-level museum and admire Coke memorabilia from yesteryear, as well as interactive exhibits in the 4-D theater. The highlight of any visit is the Taste It! room, which features more than 100 different Coke varieties from around the world (there's even one that tastes like vodka)!

Just down the street lies the Georgia Aquarium, one of the largest and best in the country, boasting six permanent exhibits about various sea mammals, from the Cold Water Quest (Beluga whales) to Ocean Explorer (whale sharks) to Dolphin Quest (dolphins, naturally!). Designed by Richard Meier and Renzo Piano, the High Museum of Art is the top museum in town, thanks to its enviable collection of contemporary and folk art and photography. Admire Target by Elizabeth Catlett or Queen's Mesh by Alan Saret.

Civil rights aficionados flock to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. Tour the late leader's birthplace as well as The Peace Plaza. You'll be captivated by the "I Have a Dream" World Peace Rose Garden, and messages of peace from local schoolchildren.

As the site of many important battles during the Civil War, Atlanta is a history buff's wonderland. Head to the Peachtree Creek Battlefield, currently occupied by Tanyard Creek Park and Oakland Cemetery or the Battles of Ezra Church, Brown's Mill, and Utoy Creek. You'll find historical markers, statues, and tombstones commemorating the dead.

For a less somber excursion, spend the day watching baseball at Turner Field. The ballpark, built in 1997 and named for native son and media mogul Ted Turner, is the home of the Atlanta Braves and is known for its old-school feel and modern amenities. It's considered one of the best parks for innovative dining.

Atlanta is world-renowned for its numerous parks and outdoor spaces. At nearly 200 acres, Piedmont Park is the city's version of Central Park, with a greenmarket, pool, dog park, and fishing site. Stone Mountain is a hotspot for hiking as well as kid-friendly activities such as gondola rides, treetop treks, and rope bridge tours. As the second largest natural rock formation after Uluru (aka Australia's Ayers Rock) it's also considered the "Mt. Rushmore of the Confederacy," due to its Confederate memorial carving.

The Atlanta Botanical Garden is a paradise for flora, from orchids to roses and everything in between, across 30 acres. One of the gardens' highlights is the Kendeda Canopy Walk, a 600-foot-long walkway above one of the last remaining urban forests in the city.

An urban oasis with a wealth of outdoor and indoor attractions, Atlanta is a world-class destination. Stay at one of our Atlanta vacation rentals and you'll see why!
#Pathname:/usa/Florida/Sugarloaf-Key/
Let the tropical island trio of warm breezes, white sand beaches, and fun in the sun guide you to deep relaxation in one of our Sugarloaf Key vacation rentals.

Deriving its name from a type of pineapple once grown in the area, Sugarloaf Key is comprised of an upper and lower island and belongs to Florida’s lower keys. The area’s abundant wildlife and great fishing make it a sportsman’s paradise, while the white sand beaches and laid-back island atmosphere appeals to casual vacationers including families, couples, and retirees.

Located between Saddlebunch Keys to the west and Cudjoe Key to the east, both upper and lower islands of Sugarloaf Key sit on open, shallow waters that play host to world-class sport-fishing. Home to tarpon, bonefish, grouper and many more large fish species, this area is particularly well-suited for those looking to land a trophy fish. Hire a guide for the day at any of the island’s fishing charters, and head out by boat to the area's prime fishing grounds, known as flats, where you’ll hook a 150-pound tarpon and have the fight of a lifetime trying to reel it in.

Non-fisherfolk will also find plenty to do! Rent kayaks and paddle into the Upper Sugarloaf Sound, where you can the explore mangrove swamp coastline alongside dolphins playing in the surf. If you prefer to have your adventures on land, grab your family and head down to see the Sugarloaf Key Bat Tower a tower built in 1929 to entice bats and provide a solution to the area’s mosquito problem. Kids will love watching the bats fly frenetically around the structure, catching insects in mid-flight.

Our Florida Keys vacation rentals in Sugarloaf Key are only 15 miles from the region's biggest draw: Key West. Head into the larger city for an afternoon touring the Hemingway Home & Museum, then take in the sunset and spectacle at Mallory Square Dock. Grab a margarita and some fresh fish tacos at one of the local restaurants...unless your fridge back in Sugarloaf Key is full of your own daily catch!

Want to avoid the Key West crowds? Head 15 miles back toward the mainland to the kayaking, scuba, and snorkeling paradise surrounding Big Pine. Divers can explore the undersea wreckage of the Adolphus Bush, and snorkelers will be well-rewarded with a trip out to the coral reefs at Looe Key.

For a fantastic home base with direct access to the best of Florida’s world-class fishing and island adventure, a stay in one of our Sugarloaf Key vacation rentals can’t be beat!

#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/St-Simons-Island/
With a fantastic year-round climate and the famous Marshes of Glynn, St. Simons Island vacation rentals have long been a destination for discerning Southerners looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city. Beautiful beaches, multiple golf courses, places to fish and canoe, and great restaurants and spas make this Georgia island a popular vacation spot each yet.

Like its fellow tranquil Golden Isles - Sea Island, Jekyll Island, and Little St. Simons Island - St. Simons is camera-ready, with streets full off moss-laden oaks and sailboats drifting through the harbor. First settled by Native Americans and then Spanish colonists, St. Simons has managed to retain a rich cultural heritage. Summer barbecues are the norm, as are lazy days spent swimming and kayaking on the water.

St. Simons packs a lot in 18 square miles. The beaches are the most popular attraction, and East Beach is the best of the bunch. It offers a wide stretch of sand, concessions, and a Coast Guard Station. Neptune Park is especially popular with kids. Relax at one of the picnic tables, take a dip in the public pool, or try your hand at miniature golf. Visitors can also fish on the pier or enjoy events during the summer at the bandstand.

The St. Simons Lighthouse Museum was constructed in 1807 and features a restored lighthouse and keeper's home, both built in 1872 after the originals were destroyed in the Civil War. Climb to the top and admire an Instagram-worthy view of the Golden Isles.

Colonial and Civil War buffs will enjoy the trolley tour through the island's historic sites. Fort Frederica National Monument is the site of a bloody but deciding battle between colonists and the Spanish in the 1600s. Admire the Spanish moss and pecan trees as you meander through the prison barracks and other remnants of the fort. Don't forget to pay your respects at the Bloody Marsh Battle site.

The two-story First African Baptist Church was built in 1869 by former slaves, and still serves as the spiritual center for the island's African American community. The lovely and amazing Avenue of the Oaks ?beckons visitors to the grounds of the Sea Island resort and its world-class golf.

The picture-perfect Marshes of the Glynn are first visible as you cross the F. J. Torras Causeway from the mainland. Made famous by poet Sidney Lanier, you'll spy salt marshes as well as fishermen harvesting shrimp, blue crab, and oysters.

Day trips from St. Simons Island are easy, and well worth a detour. The historic squares and excellent restaurants of Savannah is just an hour and a half away, offering a rich heritage and world-famous architecture. If you can't get enough of the coast, Tybee Island is also interesting, boasting a marine science center, a national monument, and two lighthouses.

#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/Tybee-Island/
Savannah is not just about stately homes and historic gardens. Tybee Island, aka Savannah Beach, attracts thousands of tourists a year and with good reason: with two well-preserved light stations, the Fort Screven historic district, and a wealth of quaint shops and restaurants, visitors have much to see and do on this barrier island 18 miles south of the city. Our Tybee Island vacation rentals are a great home base from which one can explore the area's myriad delights.

Fort Screven is a must-see for any first time visitor to Tybee.

Guests can still access Battery Garland, one of six original batteries at the site and home to the Tybee Museum.

Tybee boasts two impressive lighthouses, the most notable being the Tybee Lighthouse, built in 1736. The five-acre site offers a black and white tower and many places for quiet reflection. Tiny Cockspur Lighthouse was built in 1855 and features a 46-foot-tower that once saw 30 hours of battle during the Civil War. Grab a picnic and head to Fort Pulaski National Monument. Soldiers used the former battle site to train and march or even play baseball, and you can see remnants of the fort's construction village from the 19th century.

Not much of a history or lighthouse buff? Enjoy the natural wonder at the Tybee Island Marine Science Center. Exhibits focus on conservation and research and are perfect for a small party or larger group. Anglers of all ages head to Tybee Pier and Pavilion for the peaceful views and plethora of fish.

Tybee is close to several area hotspots, most notably beautiful and lively Savannah, which is just 18 miles away. Stroll through the lovely boulevards as you admire the stately architecture or nosh on a wonderful repast at an area restaurant. Nearby Beaufort, South Carolina, and Cumberland Island, Georgia, are also well worth a day trip, thanks to nationally-protected wildlife and land.

With natural splendor and friendly locals, you're sure to enjoy your stay at any of our Tybee Island vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/Savannah/

Here you'll find dozens of great restaurants and shops. Rent a bike or a kayak and explore!

There's so much to see in Savannah, you might want to spend your entire trip exploring the city. But if you'd like to hit the road and explore the greater coastal area, the options are plenty! From your Savannah lodging, you can see the lovely and historic coastal city of Charleston, South Carolina, in a day - it's located just about 100 miles to the north.

#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/Woodbine/

The Georgia Coast Rail-Trail is part of the national Rails to Trails Conversancy, and the Woodbine portion boasts three miles along the Satilla River with views of cedar, pine, and other indigenous trees.

Beyond outdoor adventure, Donnelly is well-known for its lively festival scene.

#Pathname:/usa/Idaho/Hayden-Lake/
Idaho is loaded with lakes. There's Coeur d'Alene, and Pend Oreielle, to name two. They're both pretty big: Coeur d'Alene is 49.8 sq. miles, and Pend Oreielle, a whopping 148. Squeezed between them, at a humble 24.75 sq. miles, is Hayden Lake -- an ideal spot for a Coeur d'Alene region vacation rental. Considering its comparatively miniscule size, one would think Little Hayden Lake would be shunned and neglected in favor of the watery behemoths sitting astride it; and one would be wrong. What Hayden Lake lacks in size is made up for in reputation.

Its shoreline has more exclusive homes per square inch than many other places in the country. Despite a population of a little over 500 souls, Hayden Lake has its own country club. Bing Crosby, we're told, liked it here, and if you're into golf, there are no less than 13 golf courses in and around Hayden Lake and nearby Coeur d'Alene . But if you think Hayden Lake is snooty, you'd be wrong about that too! From your Hayden Lake vacation rental you can enjoy the water and all the fun stuff to do nearby. Bring your boat and launch it at one of the three boat ramps located at Honeysuckle Beach, Sportsman's Park, and Tobler's Marina. Take the family over to Triple Play Fun Park where you can do everything from bumper cars, to laser tag, bowling, and rock climbing. Ride the roller coaster at Silverwood Amusement Park, test your skateboarding mettle at "sk8ts" skatepark, or slip and slide your way around the Raptor Reef Water Park.

A Hayden Lake vacation rental offers a bit of everything - the lake, golf, amusement park fun, and seemingly endless afternoons of just relaxing at your charming Hayden Lake cabin.
#Pathname:/usa/Idaho/Horseshoe-Bend/

Located about 40 minutes north of Boise and an hour and a half south of McCall, Horseshoe Bend is named after the perfect U-shape curve of the Payette River that cradles this small town. Our Horseshoe Bend vacation rentals offer rustic charm and a rural feel, without losing access to the urban thrum of Boise and the year-round recreation opportunities of McCall.

One of Horseshoe Bend's highlights is the operation of Idaho's only scenic train tours - the Thunder Mountain Line traverses along the Payette River to the town of Banks, where guests can explore the gold mine exhibit before climbing back aboard.

The South Fork of the Payette River near Horseshoe Bend offers great opportunities for fishing, kayaking, and white water raft tours. Check out hiking, bird watching, and mushroom foraging as well in the Boise National Forest. Wintertime means snow sports - resorts like Bogus Basin, Cottonwood Butte, and Tamarack all wait within a two-hour drive!

For a quiet retreat close to outdoor recreation yet not too far from Boise, consider booking one of our Horseshoe Bend vacation rentals for your next Idaho getaway!

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Bar-Harbor/
From its majestic granite cliffs to its rocky windswept shore, Bar Harbor has been a playground for Northeasterners for more than a century. Thanks to a well-preserved downtown, scenic lighthouses, and access to the nearby 47,000-acre Acadia National Park, any of our Bar Harbor vacation rentals make the perfect home base from which to explore this lovely island town and its environs.

Bar Harbor is a outdoor-lover's dream destination. Much of that is due to its location on its own island off the mainland. Most visitors head first to nearby Acadia National Park. Avid hikers have been heading here since 1919, thanks to groups such as The Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal organization, that constructed many of the trails - 120 miles in all - and campgrounds used today.

With all the comforts of home and a wonderful location to explore the surrounding region, our Maine vacation rentals in East Boothbay make a fantastic home base for your next getaway.

One of five villages in the Boothbay Harbor region, East Boothbay impresses due to its small-town feel and friendly populace.

Local boat captains allow guests to accompany them on lobster-hauling expeditions and families are welcome to take a trip on a windjammer around the harbor. You can even rent a boat to explore the numerous coves and area lighthouses on your own, or take your turn trolling for tuna and striper on a sport fisherman.

Not everything in East Boothbay is about the sea - there's plenty to do on land as well. The

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Edgecomb/
Named for an English lord who sided with American colonists, the town of Edgecomb, Maine, is a tiny hamlet in Lincoln County. Although dwarfed by bigger towns nearby, Edgecomb has its own unique appeal, thanks to small-town hospitality and a historic fort that attracts numerous history buffs every summer. Founded in 1774 but settled three decades earlier, this charming spot is home to mom-and-pop shops, tree-lined streets, and well-maintained historic buildings. Our Edgecomb vacation rentals offer a beautiful and tranquil place to holiday in the gorgeous, verdant state of Maine.

Edgecomb is located in the heart of Lincoln County and is less than three hours from Boston, in the rugged and beautiful Boothbay region. The town has less than 1500 inhabitants and retains much of its old-school feel as a result. You're not far from the Atlantic Coast and myriad fishing spots.

Fort Edgecomb State Historic Site is the premier tourist spot in town. Built in 1808, the fort was a stronghold for the port of Wiscasset and saw a lot of action during the bloody War of 1812. Tour the interior and admire the stonework. High Head Point is a favorite spot nearby for picnickers in the summer and leaf peepers in the fall. The John Moore House is listed on the National Register of Historic places. The white clapboard home on Crosspoint Road is a private residence, but can be admired from the street.

Although it's tiny, Edgecomb boasts a surprising number of quaint businesses. Savor a relaxing massage at Island Spa, one of the top spots in town for locals and anyone traveling through. Learn how to shuck oysters and take some home with you at the eco-friendly Gidden Point Oyster Sea Farm.

Edgecomb lies in the heart of the Boothbay region, which offers plenty of recreation sites as well as historic structures. The neighboring towns of East Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, and Boothbay  are all within close proximity, offering plenty of coastal splendor, hiking trails, botanical gardens, and sea adventures. Nobleboro is also nearby, boasting several great fishing sites, as is Bar Harbor, with its granite cliffs and the Abbe Museum. For a more urban environment, Boston and its plethora of cultural and historical sites, not to mention sport venues, is less than three hours away by car.

Coastal splendor amid a truly small-town feel is what you get when you stay at one of our Edgecomb vacation rentals in Maine!
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Kennebunkport/
Kennebunkport, Maine, though scintillating in the summer months, evokes the quintessential quaintness of coastal New England all year round. Known most famously for hosting George H. W. Bush's summer home, Kennebunkport attracts tourists and visitors who venture to the town for a peek at the Bush compound but stay and return annually. Regulars spend lazy afternoons on the beach or mornings perusing the downtown's eateries, boutiques, and art galleries. Once you stay in one of our Kennebunkport vacation rentals, you'll become a regular, too.

The allure of the mighty Atlantic along the bluffs of Ocean Avenue inspires nostalgia for vanished days of yore when mighty ships cruised the sea. In Kennebunkport, you can channel your adventurous spirit on a boat tour or fishing charter, shop for nautical treasures downtown, stroll through history in local museums, or simply marvel at the majesty of the sea from your beach chair, all with the satisfaction of knowing you'll be returning to one of our comfortable Maine vacation rentals at the end of your daily excursions.

During the summer months, there is no clearer indication that tranquility is near than the feeling of soft, white sand between your toes. Goose Rocks Beach definitely delivers in this department, making it a perfect place for a romantic evening walk or a quick beach chair cat nap before searching for shells and sea glass on the shoreline (we dare you to say that five times fast). Occupying three miles of coastline, Goose Rocks boasts scenic views and ample space to get your serenity on. Just note that a parking permit, available at the Kennebunkport Police Station, is required for your vehicle.

Visitors of varying political affiliations will find novelty in snapping a quick picture of Instagram-worthy Walker's Point, the aforementioned Bush compound, from a small, easily found pull-off on Ocean Road that peers directly at the promontory on which the former president's stately pad is located. However, you'll still feel like a VIP as a guest in our Kennebunkport vacation rentals!

The Seashore Trolley Museum transports visitors back in time on an electric railway car. It claims the title of largest electric railway museum in the country with about 250 trolleys, acquired from every major US city with a trolley system, on display. The museum regularly hosts public events, from ice cream nights to themed "speakeasy" gatherings for celebration with libations in Prohibition-era trolley cars.

A trek downtown to peruse Kennebunkport's quirky shops for souvenirs and support local small businesses is a must for anyone spending time in this seaside destination. Meander with a mission to Maine-ly Drizzle, a specialty gourmet olive oil and vinegar store, or to Scalawag's Pet Boutique to pick up a new chew toy for Fido. Those looking to commemorate their getaways with a work of Kennebunkport art can purchase pieces by local artists in the W. Robert Paine Gallery and the Mast Gallery, among others.

When the sea beckons, there is only one way to truly feel the motion of the ocean and appreciate its delicious bounty. Rugosa Lobster Tours offer "a hands-on lobsterman experience" as well as a tour of the Kennebunk River. If there is one thing that Kennebunkport locals know, it's that salt water and sea breezes are good for the soul.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that any vacationer staying in a coastal New England town must be in want of lobster (or any other kind of fresh seafood, for that matter). Nunan's Lobster Hut opens up at five every evening and is regularly packed by six, serving up fresh Kennebunkport-born-and-caught lobster to all who come with an appetite only the juicy red shellfish dunked in butter can satisfy.

For upscale dining with stellar views, Kennebunkport's aptly-dubbed restaurant Ocean at the Cape Arundel Inn is just the place to trade sandy beachwear for evening attire and settle in for an intimate dinner for two or food and drinks with good friends.

When it comes to the Kennebunkport art scene, perhaps no craft is as widely appreciated as the métier of exquisite ice cream, a specialty of the dairy virtuosos at Rococo Artisan Ice Cream. Sticky meets sophisticated with flavors like standard Honey Vanilla, specialties Maple Fig Jalapeño and Banana Salted Almond Caramel, and seasonal Spice Pumpkin Pie, among countless other unexpected gourmet concoctions of mouth-watering sweet and savory ingredients.

Though liveliest during the summer, Kennebunkport is picturesque when dressed in the gold and crimson hues of October foliage, enchanting under the twinkle of holiday lights in December, and romantic and cozy beneath a duvet of snow in February. This seaside town can be enjoyed year round, so there is no wrong time to book one of our Kennebunkport vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Newcastle/
Verdant hills, quiet tree-lined streets, and a beautiful riverside location make Newcastle, Maine, the perfect spot for a relaxing getaway...and our Newcastle vacation rentals offer an idyllic base to explore this lovely, small town.

Named for the Duke of Newcastle, an advisor to King George II, the town was first settled by Europeans in the 17th century. Within 50 years, there were more than 100 residents. The town soon became a shipbuilding mecca, with many of the most prominent boats in the first American navy built here. Sawmills and grist mills became the norm but today, the sleepy hamlet enjoys a peaceful reputation as a place to enjoy nature and solitude.

Newcastle lies in the heart of Lincoln County, between the Sheepscot and Damariscotta Rivers in Mid-Coast Maine. It abuts Edgecomb, Nobleboro and Wiscasset, and sits near Great Salt Bay.

This town is all about nature, and you'll revel in the abundant flora and fauna. Visitors flock to Dodge Point Public Reserved Land on the Damariscotta River. This protected green space encompasses 521 acres  and boasts bald eagles, osprey, foxes, and pine forests. Four main trails offer a wealth of scenic vistas for all levels of hikers, and you can also swim or picnic here in the summer - or snowshoe and cross-country ski in the winter.

One of the most celebrated historic homes in all of Maine lies in Newcastle. The Frances Perkins Homestead celebrates the life and accomplishments of Frances Perkins, the first female Secretary of Labor for the United States. Stroll through 57 acres of meadows and woods as you learn about her enduring legacy.

Newcastle is conveniently situated near other Lincoln County towns, making day trips around the region an easy delight. Head to Nobleboro for its amazing fishing sites. Wiscasset is home to the Sortwell Memorial Forest and bucolic Morris Farm, both great spots for a walk or invigorating hike, and Edgecomb boasts historic Fort Edgecomb and scenic places to bike along the river.

Enjoy quiet reflection and room to breathe at one of our beautiful Newcastle vacation rentals.
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Nobleboro/
Sleepy and small, Nobleboro, Maine, sees an influx of visitors during the summer. Still, even with the many New Englanders seeking quiet refuge in July and August, the town never feels overrun or overcrowded. Friendly locals outnumber tourists, and there are plenty of spots to solitarily pause and reflect on life. Traditional clapboard homes sit on tree-lined streets, and the town's slower pace is reflected in the lack of strip malls and chain stores. It's small-town New England at its finest, and our Maine vacation rentals continue that feeling of authenticity.

Founded in 1788, Nobleboro occupies 23 square miles in the heart of Lincoln County, not far from Boothbay Harbor and the rugged Atlantic Coast. Many of the town's homes were built in the late 18th and early 19th century, and a majority of residents are descendants of the original settlers. Like other towns in the region, Nobleboro was once a shipbuilding mecca. Today, it's quiet and quaint, and the perfect spot for a peaceful getaway.

Visitors should first head to the Nobleboro Historical Society, housed in a schoolhouse built in 1818. The museum boasts records of early settlers and their families and happily provides a map to points of interest in town, from the historic homes scattered throughout the area to the once-mighty factories.

Damariscotta Lake, Pemaquid Pond, and Duck Puddle Pond are popular fishing sites, and bird watchers head to the bald eagle habitat on the edge of town or the waterfowl habitat wetlands found around the area. There's plenty of green space through which one can meander, you might not see another person for miles.

Nobleboro is near many popular Maine vacation spots and even some under-the-radar towns. Hip Camden is 25 miles away and boasts a plethora of great restaurants and art galleries. Both Boothbay Harbor and neighboring East Boothbay are a short drive away, offering small-town appeal, great coastal beaches, and hiking trails galore. Beautiful Bar Harbor is worthy of a full day's visit, as it's nearly three hours away, but offers great hiking through Acadia National Park.

Quiet, calm, and with unique charm, Nobleboro delights - and our Nobleboro vacation rentals are sure to please anyone looking for peace and relaxation!
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/South-Portland/
For a relaxing getaway to a lovely waterfront town, look no further than our South Portland vacation rentals. Situated on Portland Harbor with views of Casco Bay, South Portland is home to both the largest full-service marina and the largest shopping mall in the state of Maine. South Portland is also known for its many gorgeous parks and walking trails, making it a green paradise for visitors from all around.

First settled by Europeans in 1630, South Portland once boasted farms as far as the eye can see. During the Second World War it became a shipbuilding mecca, supplying cargo ships for England. While South Portland has never officially been a part of Portland, Maine proper, the larger town's skyline is visible from many vantage points in the area.

The waterfront is the premier spot in town, with picture-perfect views as well as several historic attractions. Head to Fort Preble, a stone and earthwork military fort built in 1808. It saw combat during the Civil War through the two World Wars. Stroll down the pier to the Spring Point Ledge Light. Built in 1897, it's the only caisson-style lighthouse in the United States that is accessible via a walkway. Visit the Portland Harbor Museum next door for its displays of maritime history. The Portland Breakwater Lighthouse, aka Bug Light, built in 1875, features cast iron plates and gorgeous Corinthian columns.

The Maine Military Museum showcases the service of military vets - specifically POWs - via artifacts and exhibits. The Liberty Ship Memorial features the SS Jeremiah O'Brien - one of the liberty ships that defended the United States during the Second World War - and preserves the sacrifices by the men and women who built the ships.

The city affords guests more than 500 acres of parks and green spaces. Part of the 3,000-mile-long East Coast Greenway, the Greenbelt Walkway trail extends nearly six miles from Bug Light Park to the 140-acre Wainwright Athletic Complex. Clark's Pond Trail, a 1.1 mile-long woodland trail, winds its way through historic sections of town. Long Creek Trail boasts the spot at which Native Americans and English settlers established a treaty. Other notable trails include Red Brook Tail, Thomas Knight Park, Hinckley Park Loop, Spring Point Shoreway and West End Trails, all offering scenic walkways and bike paths through lovely woodlands and ponds.

During the summer, locals and visitors alike venture to Willard Beach, a four-acre sand and pebble beach, for fun in the sun.

South Portland is a great base from which to explore all of Maine. Drive 60 miles up the coast and you'll hit the beautiful seaside towns of Lincoln County including Boothbay Harbor, East Boothbay, Wiscasset, and Nobleboro.

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/South-Bristol/
Charming, quaint, and pleasing to the eye are all apt descriptions of South Bristol, Maine. This small town - which also includes the villages of Walpole and Christmas Cove - boasts tree-lined streets and rollings hills, making it the perfect spot for a relaxation vacation. Our South Bristol vacation rentals make that dream a reality!

First spotted by Europeans in the 15th century, the town of South Bristol wasn't permanently settled until the mid-17th century. The Wawenock tribe gave way to English settlers who named the town after its sister city in England. A brick-making, ship-building, and ice-harvesting mecca, South Bristol today maintains a reputation as a bucolic hamlet with a friendly populace. Fishing, lobstering, and tourism are its biggest draws, and a stay at one of our South Bristol vacation rentals will make you see why.

The Thompson Ice House showcases the town's history as an ice-making stronghold. You can inspect how ice was harvested and stored before refrigeration. It's especially fun to visit during the annual ice harvest in February or the ice cream social in July.

The Boothbay Region encompasses miles of pristine land in the beautiful state of Maine, and South Bristol is a great starting point to explore the whole region. Boothbay Harbor is only 30 miles away and offers a wealth of cultural and natural activities.

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Southport/
Much like the rest of coastal Lincoln County, Southport, Maine affords guests scenic vistas, tranquil neighborhoods, and a rugged coastline nonpareil. Settled by Europeans in 1623 and once called Cape Newagen Island, Southport incorporates the tiny villages of Southport, West Southport, Cape Newagen, and Squirrel island.

Today it has less than 1,000 year-round residents, making our Southport, Maine vacation rentals a choice spot for solitude seekers.

Hikers come every summer and fall to traverse the 12 acres of peaceful tree-covered terrain near the ocean. It's Maine like it should be seen.

Like its bigger sisters to the north - Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, and East Boothbay - Southport boats myriad natural wonders. First-time visitors should hike the 12-acre, half-mile loop of the Hendricks Head Trail - operated by the Boothbay Land Trust - an easy hike, but one that has a few steep and slippery climbs. End the hike at the Hendricks Head Lighthouse at the mouth of the Sheepscot River. Originally constructed in 1829, the 40-foot brick lighthouse and the two-story cottage adjacent are the keepers of spooky tales, such as the infamous "Ghostlady of the Dark" who is said to wander the grounds late at night.

Cuckolds Lighthouse, built in 1892, sits on the opposite end of the island on a separate outcropping and boasts a short tower and a small inn. The Hendricks Hill Museum along the main thoroughfare features artifacts from the ancestors of current island residents as well pictures and navigational instruments.

Situated in Sagadahoc county south of Portland, West Bath lies between Brunswick and Bath and has a modest population of nearly 1,800 year-round residents over 12 square miles.

In Newcastle you can tour the Frances Perkins Homestead to learn about the US's first female cabinet secretary, or explore the banks of the  Damariscotta River at the 521-acre Dodge Point Public Reserved Land. With numerous fishing sites, it's no wonder anglers head to charming Nobleboro.

Long Sands stretches for nearly two miles and offers views of the noble Nubble Lighthouse. Surf the rolling waves to epitomize seaside cool and achieve the perfect windswept hairstyle. Duck out of the sun for a sandwich or some soft serve on the boardwalk. Don't worry about having to dress up - casual dining establishments where flip flopped feet are welcome are abundant on the boardwalk!

Family-friendly Short Sands is only a quick walk or trolley ride away and families with younger children will find hours of entertainment there. Though smaller than its sister beach, Short Sands has a public playground, several basketball courts, a lush open lawn area, and a bustling boardwalk. Once you've perfected the ultimate sandcastle at the beach, make the short trek into town for a sweet reward or to browse the trinkets and souvenirs in the quirky shops . Watch the hypnotic motion of the taffy pullers through the windows of The Goldenrod, a can't-miss-it destination where York's salt water taffy connoisseurs have been prepping and packaging their famous taffy "Kisses" (and other irresistible confections) since 1896.

York's Wild Kingdom, a zoo and amusement park combo, is a popular destination for those looking to take a break from the beach with the kids. Take a ride on the Ferris Wheel and enjoy a unique and heightened perspective of the town!

When the happiest hour of the day rolls around, there is no swankier place to be than on the deck at Gigi's Italian Restaurant for custom cocktails and half-priced oysters.

Short Sands is also the main venue for "York Days" which takes place annually in August and features a sandcastle building contest, a craft fair, and a softball tournament. Offering attractions and activities for guests of all ages and interests, York Days culminates in a fireworks show at the end of the weekend.

No stay at York Beach is complete without a trip (or two!) to the Nubble Lighthouse, a literal beacon of light located at the tip of the rocky bluff of Sohier Park. A popular Northeast tourist attraction, the Nubble is both stalwart and charming and is prominently featured in family photos of those who visit the area. The Nubble is the perfect backdrop for an after dinner stroll or an early morning run. Savor a juicy lobster roll or the final licks of favored ice cream flavor "Maine Survivor" from on-site restaurant Fox's Lobster House while snapping photos. Unwavering and photogenic, the Nubble always looks good in pictures!

York Beach is only twelve and a half miles North from hours of shopping at the Kittery Outlets. On the way to Kittery, sample fresh gourmet bread at the When Pig's Fly Bakery and test fine jams and jellies at Stonewall Kitchen's flagship store. Those looking to venture up the coast can explore beaches in Wells and Ogunquit or immerse themselves in the art scene in Portland, which is only about forty-eight miles North of York Beach. Book an early morning deep sea fishing trip out of Wells or observe the glittering Atlantic from the Marginal Way in Ogunquit. Inland, the Museums of Old York offer history buffs the opportunity to step out of the twenty-first century and into the historical heritage of coastal Maine!

Charming, cozy, and bursting with sun-soaked attractions and opportunities to indulge major lobster cravings, York is perfect for your next getaway!

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Wiscasset/
Our growing selection of Wiscasset, Maine vacation rentals provide the perfect home base to explore the rolling hills, freshwater streams, and plentiful wildlife make Wiscasset one of the main draws in Lincoln County. Friendly locals and a wealth of mom-and-pop shops lining Main Street keep the in-the-know tourists coming. With a long a fishing history, Wiscasset today enjoys a reputation as a boating and wetland mecca as well as the "worm capital of the world" (no wonder anglers love this place). Scenic rivers boast trout, and the bay and ocean are full of clams, lobster, and mussels.

Stay at one of our traditional Wiscasset vacation rentals and you'll see why this charming village continues to enthrall Maine visitors and locals alike.

Sandwiched between quaint Edgecomb and charming Dresden, Wiscasset is located in Lincoln County, in midcoast Maine, near Boothbay Harbor. It boasts more than 2,000 acres of preserved land, much of it part of a historic greenbelt.

If you love nature, you'll love Wiscasset. You can enjoy solitude, hiking nearly 20 miles of trails. Start in the village and enjoy the historic homes and scenic harbor views. The West Woods and Morris Farm trail will lead you through 200 acres of land, over streams and bridges and through the Sortwell Memorial Forest and Morris Farm. The latter is operated by a trust that encourages sustainable farming and hosts educational programs. You can admire Clydesdale horse, holstein cows, and a resident goat. The Water Trail is just what it says: a trail down the Back River that is best enjoyed in a kayak or canoe. The Back River Trail on the Cushman Mountain Reserve takes you through woodland and meadows to a scenic outlook. End your day traversing forest and salt marshes on Chewonki Neck, concluding at historic Eaton Farm.

More than 200 years old and made of granite slabs, the 1812 Jail is one the most visited sites in town. Once the jail for the entire state, it stopped housing prisoners in 1953. Today, guests can tour the facility and see what life was like for the 50 prisoners that were housed here, as well as the jailkeeper's family, who lived next door. Castle Tucker is a well-maintained Regency-style mansion that was built in 1807 and renovated in 2014. Once the home of a prominent shipping family, visitors can tour the interior and gardens and enjoy picture-perfect views of the Sheepscot River. A barn and carriage house still remain.

Another historic home built in 1807 that is well worth a visit is the Federalist-style Nickels-Sortwell House. Once a private residence, then a tavern and hotel, then a residence again, the home came into semi-public hands in 1958. You can admire antique wing chairs, braided rugs, and various portraits of the former owners.

Wiscasset is also known for its art galleries featuring local artists. The Wiscasset Bay Gallery highlights 18th, 19th, and 20th century paintings and sculpture, including works by William Trost Richards, Charles Woodbury, and Abraham Bogdanove.

Like other towns in the region, Wiscasset is a great base from which to seek day trips. The region is home to beautiful wetlands, great fishing sites, hiking and camping trails galore, and scenic lighthouses and sea vistas, along with many other charming small towns. Edgecomb is just next door, as are East Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Boothbay, and Nobleboro.

With a plethora of great hiking and kayaking trails, as well as historic homes worth a tour, it's no wonder Wiscasset is a traveler's paradise. Our Wiscasset vacation rentals provide the perfect retreat to explore this coastal wonderland.
#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Aquinnah/
The center of Wampanoag culture, Aquinnah, Massachusetts, offers gorgeous red clay cliffs, beautiful beaches, and historic structures galore. A stay at one of our Aquinnah vacation rentals allows you to see for yourself why this is one of the hidden gems on lovely Martha's Vineyard!

The Wampanoag tribe has lived in this community for hundreds of years and they still make up much of the populace. English settlers arrived in 1669 and turned the town into a whaling center of note.

Unfortunately, the Gay Head Lighthouse had to be moved in recent years due to beach erosion. Never fear, you can still visit this historic brick and sandstone structure originally built in 1799 to help whalers return home! It's just a mere 120 feet from its original location.

You've heard of the white cliffs of Dover, but here you can admire the red cliffs of Aquinnah! ?Considered a national landmark, these well-preserved red clay cliffs beckon everyone who arrives on the Vineyard. You can admire them up close at Moshup Beach, one of the town's only public beaches, or at the overlook atop the attraction.

#Pathname:/usa/Maryland/Ocean-City/
Maryland is filled with bonafide summer playgrounds, and one of its premier vacation spots is Ocean City. Ever since the Algonquins came here to fish hundreds of years ago, this coastal town three hours from Washington, D.C., has been a hotbed of activity...and our selection of Ocean City vacation rentals provide the perfect home base to explore this fun-filled area!

The Europeans first arrived in the early 1500s, but it wasn't until 1875 that Ocean City became synonymous with summer fun. With numerous outdoors activities - from sunbathing to windsurfing to horseback riding to biking - and a plethora of cultural sites, Ocean City enthralls all who visit. Every summer, thousands of people head to its sunny shores to eat, drink, and be merry. Try your hand at fishing for white marlin (the city is the world capital of the sport!), join a day camp in the activity of your choice, or venture on a sailboat and tour the barrier islands. Whatever you choose to do, our Maryland vacation rentals are the perfect home base for your family vacation in this scenic 10-mile coastal wonderland.

The historic boardwalk should fall under the can't-miss category on your itinerary. Originally built in 1900, the three-mile wooden gangway features food, arcade, and shopping options for the entire family. Take your bike down the wooden planks and try a bit of saltwater taffy - or a world-renowned Maryland crab cake. Ride the 100 year-old carousel at Trimper's Rides. The Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum sits on one end of the boardwalk and features exhibits and memorabilia about the Worcester County coastal region and the origins of the U.S. Coast Guard. Children will love the aquarium and shipwreck exhibitions. Another boardwalk attraction is Ripley's Believe it or Not!, featuring more than 500 oddities that have to be seen to be believed (there's even a real shrunken head!).

The Ocean City Center for the Arts boasts a two-story gallery that includes an art library and pottery studio. Exhibits change monthly and feature local and regional artists. The town has a couple of lovely green spaces at which to picnic and take in the scenery. The 58-acre Northside Park is the largest in town, and offers guests baseball fields and a soccer field as well as a fishing lagoon and expansive gym. Little Salisbury Park is a local favorite, with two tennis courts and a basketball court as well as the town's art league.

What would Ocean City be without sun, sand and surf? The 10-mile beach is what attracts visitors each summer, and it's where most spend the majority of their stay. Frolic in the waves, kite surf, or fly a kite on a warm summer's day. You can watch for dolphins or professionals at work building sand castles. Kids will love the beach volleyball nets and the weekly Family Beach Olympics (through July and August). The beach plays host to movie nights, as well as concerts and firework extravaganzas.

Nearby Assateague Island is a site to behold. A protected national seashore, you get secluded sandy beaches amid coast bays on this barrier island eight miles south of Ocean City. Look for the famous Assateague's wild horses, descendants of the domesticated variety who roam this barren land freely, or try your had at clam digging. The beach will draw you but the horses will make you return year after year.

Ocean City is situated on the Maryland-Delaware border, making it an easy gateway to the mid-Atlantic region. You're not far from the sleepy coastal hamlets of Maryland's eastern shore, nor sports-centric Baltimore or beautifully-maintained Annapolis, the state capital. Washington D.C. is also just a couple of hours away, as are the historic Virginia and Maryland towns that surround our nation's capital.

Sun and fun await you in this historic summer playground. Our Ocean City vacation rentals are your best bet to take in this action-packed town on the state's Atlantic coast!
#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Barnstable/
Lying midway on the Cape's "arm," the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, is one of historic splendor and coastal wonder. From a well-maintained and busy harbor to historic structures dating back to the mid-19th century, Barnstable was founded in 1638 and incorporates seven villages - from bustling Hyannis to quaint Barnstable to historic Cotuit - making it the largest town on the Cape. Our selection of Barnstable vacation rentals provide the most authentic way to experience this charming region!

Mom-and-pop shops abut traditional gray clapboard homes, making one feel as if he or she has stepped into the past. Preservationists have doggedly worked to maintain the historic nature of the villages - more than 75 structures are on the National Register of Historic Places - and with notable residents such as Kennedys, the visitors keep coming. Our Cape Cod vacation rentals in Barnstable offer traditional accommodations, with a bit of modernity thrown in. This summer, why not head to one of our Barnstable homes and see for yourself why this town is a destination nonpareil on the Cape?

Barnstable will keep you occupied however long you stay - and thanks to its historic sites and museums, you'll be entertained rain or shine. The Cahoon Museum of American Art in Cotuit showcases the work of Ralph and Martha Cahoon and other 19th century pieces. The Trayser Museum was once the custom house and post office but is now the U.S. Coast Guard Heritage Museum and boasts a 17th century jail and lighthouse.

One of the most popular spots in town is the Kennedy Compound. The former home of family Patriarch Joe Kennedy as well as his sons JFK, Robert, and Ted, the expansive estate features three houses and other structures on six acres of prim coastline. After Ted's death, the family donated the main house to the Edward Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate in 2012 to host public seminars and tours. The project remains ongoing, but you can still take pics and admire the Camelot splendor from afar. The John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum celebrates the legacy of our 35th president, and his love of Cape Cod.

History buffs should head directly to the Olde Colonial Courthouse. One of the oldest courthouses in the United States, this wooden structure played a pivotal role in the founding of our nation. It's here in 1774 that Samuel Adams and more than 1,500 men interrupted the King's Court proceedings that sought to deny a trial by jury for colonists. Today, it hosts "Tales of Cape Cod," a lecture series recording the voices of past Cape Codders.

Of course, Barnstable is also known for its duney beaches abutting the Atlantic. Sandy Neck Beach Park is one of the Cape's finest, with miles of dunes, marshes, and forests featuring local wildlife. Craigville Beach is on the Nantucket Sound and is popular with kite surfers in the summer.

With its unique position on the "bicep" of the Cape, Barnstable is the perfect base from which to explore the region, from forearm to upper arm. Our Barnstable vacation rentals make it easy. Hyannis is the transport hub, and offers flights to and from cosmopolitan Boston as well as flights and ferry service to tony and windswept Nantucket and beguiling Martha's Vineyard.

The towns of Dennis, Yarmouth, Falmouth, Plymouth, and Sandwich are less than an hour away, and each offers a multitude of delights, from historic structures to duney beaches to cozy restaurants where everyone is treated like a local. The rest of the Cape, from gay-friendly Provincetown to vintage Chatham, is just a drive away.

The Caleb Nickerson House, circa 1772, is a classic example of colonial architecture, with wooden wainscoting and pine board floors.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Falmouth/
Enjoy the spacious skies at one of our Falmouth vacation rentals, and see for yourself why this town is one of the most popular in Massachusetts.

One of the largest communities on Cape Cod, Falmouth is also one of the most historic, with eight villages inside its 55 square miles, and four districts - Falmouth Village Green, North Falmouth Village, Waquoit, and West Falmouth Village - on the National Register of Historic Places.

Filled with many sightseeing options, the town swells in the summer due to its reputation as a popular seaside destination on Cape Cod. Settled by Europeans in 1660, the town boasts tree-lined streets, clapboard homes, and plentiful beaches and parks. Fishing and windsurfing are popular activities through the warmer months, and you'll be hard-pressed to stay indoors when the balmy breezes waft from the shore. When native daughter Katherine Lee Bates penned "America the Beautiful," she must have had Falmouth in mind!

Built on nearly nine acres, the Falmouth Pumping Station, circa 1898, features a stock house, chlorination tanks, and a water treatment building around Long Pond. Nobska Lighthouse in Woods Hole overlooks Martha's Vineyard and dates back to 1826, although the current tower was built 50 years later.

Falmouth Museums on the Green includes the museum visitor center as well as two 18th-century homes filled with antiques, textiles, art, and artifacts about the town's history. There are even guided walking tours of town. Highfield Hall & Gardens boasts 400 acres of trails, as well as spectacular gardens with a 19th-century building as the backdrop.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Hyannis/
As Cape Cod's transportation and commercial hub, Hyannis, Massachusetts is the gateway to the coastal region - Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard included - and is also known as a boating and fishing center. Its picturesque natural harbor and friendly locals delight tourists from around the world who come to town to visit historic institutions such as the Hyannis Armory, site of John F. Kennedy's victory speech after the 1960 presidential election. A Hyannis vacation rental is a great base from which to explore the town and surrounding region!

The village - one of seven in the town of Barnstable - boasts memorable sites, especially if you're a Kennedy buff. The John F. Kennedy Museum boasts multimedia exhibits celebrating all things JFK. Watch videos and admire photos spanning three decades of JFK's life on Cape Cod, a haven for many Kennedys. Near Kalmus Beach lies the John F. Kennedy Memorial, featuring a large medallion of the 35th U.S. President.

The Cape Cod Maritime Museum showcases paintings and relics commemorating the region's maritime past and present. The remains of the Sparrow-Hawk, a ship that wrecked off Cape Cod in 1626, are particularly memorable. Stroll through the streets of the HyArts Cultural District and admire galleries and art shanties. Music lovers will rejoice at the Cape Cod Symphony, which performs 10 masterpiece and 12 CapePOPS concerts at the 1400-seat Barnstable Performing Arts Center every season.

A visit to Hyannis wouldn't be complete without a jaunt to the beautiful harbor to watch the ships pass by. Three beaches are within walking distance from many of our Hyannis vacation rentals, all with stunning views of the sea and offering plenty of places to enjoy a picnic or gaze at a lovely sunset. Kalmus Beach is arguably the most popular, with sand dunes and seashells galore. Windsurfers head here in the shoulder season, thanks to strong breezes. Orrin Keyes Beach is great for families due to its calm water and soft sand. Enjoy a period of quiet reflection at Veteran's Park Beach, which boasts two historical monuments and a small park with trees.

As the gateway to Cape Cod, Hyannis is in the heart of it all and so is your Hyannis, MA, vacation rental. Many visitors pass through on their way to other parts of the Cape or to the tony islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, both of which are accessible via ferry (one hour trips than run five times a day in low and shoulder season, six times a day in high season) or a short Cape Air flight. The other villages of Barnstable are worth a visit, especially nearby Cotuit, which boasts the Cahoon Museum of American Art and the Cotuit Center for the Arts. The former features folk paintings as well as 19th and 20th century and contemporary American art. The latter showcases area talent via plays, concerts and art.

Whether its combing for seashells, taking in a concert, or feeling nostalgic for a former president, Hyannis can't be beat. That's why a Hyannis, MA, vacation rental is the perfect getaway for your next Cape Cod adventure!
#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Nantucket/
With pristine beaches, well-preserved lighthouses, award-winning restaurants and annual arts and sports festivals, Nantucket is one of the most alluring islands off the East Coast. Offering a slower pace of life amid soft ocean breezes and tranquil shores, you may find you won't be able to get enough of it (well-traveled Nantucket homeowners like Senator John Kerry and New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick certainly haven't). For your first visit or your fiftieth, our Nantucket vacation rentals will make your stay on "The Grey Lady" a memorable one.

Situated 30 miles from the shores of Cape Cod, Nantucket can be reached by air and sea. Cape Air flies direct from Providence, Rhode Island; Boston, New Bedford, Hyannis and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts; and White Plains, New York. Charter airlines offer flights as well, and the high-speed ferry from Hyannis and Harwich Port leaves daily. Most Nantucket Island rentals are concentrated in Nantucket Town (or just "Town", to the locals).

Nantucket is a quintessential Massachusetts summer colony, and mainlanders flock in droves to the island in July and August. While a stay in a Nantucket summer house is a lovely getaway, if you can swing it, shoulder season is a great time to visit for a more authentic experience. Rent a bike and glide down the island’s 50 miles of well-paved bike path. You’ll spy a 1,000-acre nature preserve full of scrub oak in the Middle Moors, as well as the marshy Pout Ponds and Altar Rock, the fourth-highest elevation on the island.

Nantucket wouldn't be famous if it wasn't for its three lighthouses, two of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Situated on different corners of the island, guests can visit the well-maintained Brant Point Light, Sankaty Head Light, and Great Point Light - all in one day!

Jethro Coffin House is the oldest residence on the island, and has been lovingly restored to its former glory. The Whaling Museum offers a glimpse into the island's past, and features a restored 19th-century candle factory and a sperm whale skeleton. Stroll down the streets of the Nantucket Historic District to get a sense of how the island transformed from a remote outpost to the tony enclave it is today. On these quiet lanes, it's almost as if time has stood still.

Each of Nantucket's numerous beaches offers a unique experience. The north shore boasts warmer water and smaller waves (on this side of the island, head to Jetties Beach). Surfside on the south shore is popular with locals and tourists alike. The east and west shore beaches suffer from heavy currents and a bit of soil erosion, but Great Point and 'Sconset Beach are the best bets. You can spy seals at play at the former, and the latter began its history as a home to deck hands on furlough from whaling ships.

Duney beaches, outdoor havens, and historic architecture draw visitors back year after year - and you can explore it all from one of our Nantucket vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Newburyport/

With its coastal location, Newburyport boasts a plethora of natural wonders. First-time visitors often head to Maudslay State Park on the Merrimack River.

Architecture buffs will delight in the well-maintained Federal-style homes that line High Street as well as the Essex County Superior Courthouse, designed in 1805 by Charles Bulfinch. Bartlett Mall was built in 1801 but redesigned in the late 1800s by architect Charles Elliot. The Cushing House Museum & Garden is a prime example of Federalist architecture and boasts silver, furnishings, and other objects from the 19th century as well gardens and a carriage house. The Firehouse Center for the Arts ?housed in - you guessed it - a restored firehouse, seats nearly 200 people at live music, dance, and theater performances.

The entire North Shore of Massachusetts is a delight, and Newburyport offers a great base from which to explore this region and beyond. Quaint Newbury is mere minutes away, offering an arts center and historic schoolhouse. Plum Island is just off the coast and boasts nature and wildlife.

The small town in Essex County includes the villages of Plum Island, Old Town, and Byfield, and boasts a plethora of historic sites as well as quaint shops and restaurants.

Built in 1690, the Spencer-Peirce Little Farm boasts 230 acres of history, from a stone and brick 17th-century manor to a farmhouse and farm animal fostering facility. Guests can pump water from the well or explore trails on the property. The Lower Green Schoolhouse is open to guests on summer weekends, offering a glimpse into a 19th century schoolhouse, complete with vintage desks and other paraphernalia. The Byfield Community Arts Center showcases art, music, and plays throughout the year and has a rich sense of community.

Once a part of nearby Edgartown, Oak Bluffs became its own community in 1880 (it was formerly dubbed Cottage City). Named for the oak groves that grew along the bluffs overlooking Nantucket Sound, Oak Bluffs has long been a tourism stronghold. In the 19th century, tourists arrived from the mainland via steamer and shopped, danced, and swam to their hearts' content. Today, thousands of visitors head here each summer to swim in the warm waters of the Sound and to enjoy concerts, art festivals, and other activities throughout the season.

?Oak Bluffs boasts a wealth of attractions, the most notable being the Flying Horses Carousel. This Victorian-era merry-go-round, the nation's oldest, is a National Historic Landmark and delights children and adults from spring to fall.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Salem/
Witchcraft comes to mind when one thinks of Salem, Massachusetts - as the site of the infamous Salem Witch Trials of 1692, it's no wonder this city north of Boston has a spooky reputation. But to think of Salem as a destination only for lovers of the macabre would be a disservice to this unique town.

Salem boasts historic sites, top-notch museums and outdoor activities galore, making it one of the most popular destinations in the Northeast. Settled by Europeans in 1626, the town has managed to retain its easy-going vibe as it offers many big-city amenities. Our Salem vacation rentals are the perfect home base for exploring all the haunted or non-haunted happenings in this coastal Massachusetts town.

Salem boasts myriad sites that delight historians and literature buffs alike. The most famous of these is The House of the Seven Gables. Named after the Nathaniel Hawthorne Gothic novel of the same name, the Colonial Revival mansion was home to philanthropist Caroline O. Emmerton's Settlement Program, which trained 19th-century immigrants in English, homemaking, and work skills. It continues its philanthropic endeavors today with language and cognition classes as well as work prep and training, and also showcases Hawthorne's life in Salem and beyond.

The Peabody Essex Museum houses art, architecture, and New England culture. Of particular note is the museum's extensive collection of 19th-century Asian photography and Asian, Native American, and Oceanic art. Salem Pioneer Village 1630 celebrates the city's Puritan heritage and features actors depicting 17th-century colonial life. Meander through three acres of authentic colonial dugouts, wigwams, and thatched-roof homes.

Of course, when it comes to spooky comings and goings, you can't beat Salem. The Salem Witch Museum is one of the most visited sites in town, thanks to its authentic trial documents from the Salem witch hunt. Docents lead guests through stage sets and other artifacts about the mass hysteria that swept the town in 1692. Three other museums boast creepy exhibits, sets, and reenactments for the whole family: The Witch Dungeon Museum, The Witch History Museum, and The New England Pirate Museum lure tourists with their macabre tales of Salem's past. Every October, the town is bursting at the seams with visitors thanks to the many Halloween events. From parades to costume balls to family film screenings, more than 250,000 enjoy the fun every year.

If you ever get tired of seeing the historic sites, guests in our Salem vacation rentals will find many places to while away the hours outdoors, from hiking to picnicking and everything in between. The Salem Maritime National Historic Site preserves the city's nautical history and encompasses nearly 10 acres of waterfront land, including the Derby, Hatch's, and Central wharves and the U.S. Customs House, as well as a replica tall ship. The Derby Wharf Light Station has been serving the community since the late 1800s, and is one of only five square lighthouses in the nation.

As the commercial and tourism hub of the South Shore, the city sees millions of visitors annually, especially in the weeks surrounding Thanksgiving. Our Plymouth vacation rentals offer a great place to relax and unwind in this historically significant Massachusetts city.

The Mayflower II is an exact replica of the original Mayflower, and is just steps from Plymouth Rock. The park is also home to the ?National Monument to the Forefathers, an 81-foot granite slab celebrating the Pilgrims' voyage.

Head to Plimouth Plantation for recreations of the original settlement and a 17th century Native-American village as well as a barn with rare animals and a grist mill.

Founded in 1824, Pilgrim Hall Museum tells the story of the Pilgrims and the Plymouth colony and is the oldest continually operating museum in the country. The Richard Sparrow House is the oldest house in town, having been built in 1640, and is now home to a pottery studio. The Jabez Howland House is one of the few in town that an actual Pilgrim called home. Ask a docent to take you on a tour of the the two-story wood frame building's cozy interior.

Parting Ways features the graves of four African-Americans of different stations who fought in the War of Independence; the 94-acre site commemorates the sacrifice and positive contributions of African-Americans in the Revolutionary War. The Mayflower House Museum celebrates the 102 Pilgrims and their millions of descendants around the globe.

The city is not just historic homes and museums. There's plenty of green spaces, too. The Brewster Gardens evoke classic English gardens of old and is a popular location for bridal shoots. Myles Standish State Forest affords guests five camping areas near 16 ponds, a section for horse camping and a pond specifically for swimming or canoeing. Beachcombers will love Ellisville Harbor State Park because of its barrier beach, but anyone interested in fresh air and cool breezes will enjoy the sphagnum bog, flower-laden meadows, and pine forest.

The towns of Sandwich, Dennis, Yarmouth, and Falmouth are less than an hour away and offer a wealth of dining, shopping, and recreational opportunities.

Cape Cod and all its coastal splendor is worthy of a day trip, whether gay-friendly Provincetown or charming Chatham. Hyannis is a great point to head onto the ferry to nearby Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.

Provincetown is at the tip of the Cape, and benefits from light breezes and gentle waves due to its isolated location.

Herring Cove Beach is popular with the LGBT community, and Breakwater Beach boasts places to hike as well as gather shellfish.

The former military post of Long Point, on a peninsula in Provincetown harbor, features a lighthouse built in 1827 and a secluded beach far from the madding crowds. Race Point Lighthouse and Wooden End Lighthouse both offer great spots for peaceful reflection, although the former requires a bit of a trek to get to.

The Provincetown Art Museum celebrated its centennial in 2014 and features more than 3,000 works of abstract and contemporary art from 700 local and international artists. As a long-established, world-renowned artists' colony, many art galleries dot Provincetown, from the heart of Commercial Street, the town's main thoroughfare, to the side streets.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Salisbury/

Summer vacation colonies don't get much better than lovely Truro, Massachusetts. This sleepy town on the northern tip of Cape Cod is replete with beautiful duney beaches and small-town hospitality. Bask in the sun and surf at one of our Truro vacation rentals. They offer the perfect escape from the everyday.

Native Americans called the town Payomet, fishing off its picturesque shores for many generations. The Pilgrims landed here in 1620, finding plentiful fresh water and maize. The town was finally incorporated in 1709, becoming a shipbuilding center for a short time but thrived once farmers began cultivating crops such as asparagus and turnips. The railroad, built after the Civil War, brought summer tourists from Boston and they have never stopped returning since. Today, Truro remains a sleepy town most of the year but bursts at the seams come summer. You'll love it, too, thanks to our Truro vacation cottages.

Truro is all about the beach and with it occupying a bit of the Cape Cod National Seashore, you're never far from captivating dunes and crystal clear water. Several beaches lie within the confines of town. Ballston Beach rates highly for its decent waves and accessibility by bike. Corn Hill Beach is a family-friendly bay refuge with plentiful parking, gorgeous views, and warm water. Fisher Beach features calm waters and lots of space. Expert kayakers flock to Great Hollow Beach. The relative isolation of Longnook Beach makes it appealing to locals. Fish to your heart's content at cozy Pond Village Beach or enjoy quiet solitude at Ryder Beach.

With their location near the tip of the Cape, our Truro vacation rentals are uniquely positioned to offer great escapes for the entire family. You can start your day in trendy Provincetown, just 10 miles to the north, that offers great restaurants and nightlife. Wellfleet is five miles to the south and boasts the Wellfleet Preservation Hall and the Wellfleet Bay Sanctuary. Eastham and Chatham offer a wealth of cultural and outdoor attractions.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Astoria/
The charming seaport of Astoria, Oregon sits along precarious hilltops above the Columbia River, just before it flows into the Pacific Ocean. As the oldest American settlement west of the Rockies, it's hard to say what her biggest claim to fame might be: bustling fishing docks and canneries, spectacular shipwrecks, historic Lewis & Clark sites... who are we kidding? It's The Goonies. The cult classic was filmed here, and the labyrinth of Victorian homes dangling from the hillsides will be instantly recognizable to any fan.

Beyond its pop culture significance, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Astoria offers visitors a diverse selection of attractions and activities unlike any other town along the Northern Oregon Coast. History buffs can follow in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark in the surrounding state parks, or spend time at the Columbia River Maritime Museum learning about the area's traditions of fishing, shipping, and tragic shipwrecks (or, visit shipwrecks in person along the coast!).

Fans of food and drink will be delighted to find a number of waterfront bistros, casual fish houses, and a few highly regarded microbreweries; don't miss out on the spectacular views and hoppy IPA's at Fort George Brewery. Families will enjoy admiring the towering mural on the Astoria Column, and climbing to the top for jaw-dropping views of the ocean and surrounding mountains. In the summertime, kids love to spot fishing boats and sea lions from a seat on the historic riverfront trolley. Outdoor enthusiasts won't want to miss Fort Stevens State Park just outside the city limits, with sandy beaches, miles of hiking trails, excellent bird watching, freshwater lakes, swimming, and horseback riding.

An Astoria, Oregon vacation rental is just under two hours' drive from Portland, and just over three from Seattle. Although surrounded by natural beauty, you'll find all the amenities of city life in a charming small-town setting; yes, even a good local coffeehouse! While vacation rentals are generally prohibited in Astoria proper, its neighbor to the south - the quiet beachfront town of Gearhart - offers a wide variety of great vacation options. While you're there, enjoy the bustling boardwalks of Seaside, or head across the spectacular Astoria-Megler Bridge to Washington's beautiful Cape Disappointment State Park.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Barview/
The little town of Barview is a fisherman's dream, but also makes an excellent home base for an Oregon Coast vacation rental for any visitor hoping to explore the Northern Oregon Coast. Barview sits on the mouth of Tillamook Bay, between the resort town of Rockaway Beach and the busy little seaport of Garibaldi. The surrounding inland lakes and rivers make for an outdoorsman's paradise. Boating, crabbing, kayaking, hiking, beach combing, surfing, and of course fishing are just some of the area's popular activities. Everything you could need, from a guided charter to a simple crab pot, can be rented within a few miles of town.

Beach walkers and bird watchers will adore the location of Barview vacation rental. The sandy shores begin in nearby Barview Jetty County Park, and stretch northward for nearly eight miles, past the scenic Twin Rocks, to Rockaway Beach. While the obvious attraction here is the Pacific, don't neglect the beautiful Tillamook State Forest just to the east. The evergreen-covered mountains provide plenty of scenic hikes, including one that leads to the tallest waterfall in the Coast Range at Munson Creek Falls State Park, just half an hour from Barview.

For dining and shopping, Barview has a few select options, but most of the activity will be found in Garibaldi (2.5 miles away), Rockaway Beach (4 miles) or, for "big-city" amenities, Tillamook (12 miles). Along with a larger selection of restaurants and supermarkets, Tillamook offers plenty of rainy-day attractions: tastings & tours at the famous Tillamook Cheese Factory, enjoying a more low-key cheese experience at the lovely Blue Heron French Cheese Company), viewing restored WWII-era aircraft at the Tillamook Air Museum, or learning about the region's past at the Tillamook County Pioneer Museum.

A Barview vacation rental along the Northern Oregon Coast makes it an ideal home base for those seeking a peaceful retreat. The town has less hustle and bustle than most beach towns, but still offers wonderful scenery and is close to the region's star attractions. Within an hour to the north lie the tourist destinations of Cannon Beach and Seaside; to the south, explorers will delight in the Three Capes Scenic Drive, with its historic lighthouses and panoramic views. Portlanders can be in Barview in less than two hours, and Seattleites in just over four.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Arch-Cape/
Quiet Arch Cape is a tucked-away hamlet two miles south of Cannon Beach, and an Oregon Coast vacation rental here is just the place to find peace and solitude along the beautiful shores of the Northern Coast. Primarily a residential community, you won't find any souvenir shops or saltwater taffy here... and that's just the way Arch Cape likes it. Those amenities are within easy reach, but the town itself feels much more remote and hidden away than its busier, more touristy counterparts. For reflection, romance, and a true sense of getting away from it all, a relaxing Arch Cape vacation rental is the ultimate Oregon Coast destination.

For lovers of the great outdoors, Arch Cape is centrally located between Oswald West State Park and Hug Point. Oswald West offers a number of hikes for both experienced and novice explorers, ranging from the muddy climb up to panoramic Cape Falcon or an easy stroll to surfer-friendly Short Sands Beach. Hug Point is a more intimate destination, with a seasonal waterfall and portions of beach only accessible at low tide, making for a truly isolated Oregon coast experience. To get out and explore the water a little closer-up, consider booking a tour from Kayak Tillamook on the North Fork of the Nehalem River.

All the commercial amenities a vacationer could need are just four miles north in Cannon Beach, one of the Oregon Coast's most popular beach communities. Wine bars, art galleries, boutiques, and pizza parlors are within easy reach, but the weekend crowds remain behind as you return to peaceful Arch Cape. Manzanita, only ten miles south, offers a slower pace than Cannon Beach but amenities such as a pub, grocery store, and a few charming galleries and shops.

Just over an hour and a half from Portland, and under four hours from Seattle, a cozy Arch Cape vacation rental offers plenty of peace and relaxation to soothe away the stress of daily life... an undiscovered gem along the Northern Oregon Coast.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Bay-City/
One of our Oregon Coast vacation rentals in little Bay City, a small enclave just south of Garibaldi, seems an unlikely destination for foodies. Yet this sleepy fishing village draws in out-of-towners with some of the freshest seafood in the state... and it makes a great home base, with plenty of peace and quiet, for exploring the rest of the Northern Oregon Coast. Whether you stay in a charming cottage or one of our Oregon Coast yurts, you're sure to find plenty to love in Bay City. Just off Highway 101, the must-eat spot in Bay City is the Fish Peddler restaurant in the Pacific Oyster processing facility. While not a white-tablecloth experience by any means, slurping shellfish doesn't get any fresher than this. The restaurant recently brought in a former McCormick and Schmick's executive to revamp the menu, which now features oyster po' boys and Dungeness crab cakes. If seafood's not your thing, they also offer locally-sourced burgers; head to the nearby Tillamook County Smoker to stock up on the jerky, sausage, and pepperoni they've been making for over 35 years. Of course, you can also pick up groceries and make a hearty feast (seafood or not) back in the full kitchen of your cozy Bay City vacation rental. While Bay City itself is quite small, its proximity to the star attractions of Tillamook County make it an ideal spot. Tillamook's Cheese Factory and Air Museum are perfect rainy day attractions. Head to the miles of sandy shoreline near Rockaway Beach for surfing, sand castle building, and kite flying, all within a ten-minute drive of Bay City. Don't miss out on the nearby Three Capes Scenic Drive, which begins just south of town, or hiking in the Tillamook State Forest to the east; popular Seaside & Cannon Beach are within an hour's drive north. Situated only an hour and a half from Portland, a Bay City vacation rental is an often-overlooked but worthy destination for a Northern Oregon Coast getaway.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Beaver/
Beaver is a small community nestled along Highway 101 on the Oregon Coast. Travelers pass through this tiny town on their way to larger cities. This friendly area may not look like much - it has few residents and even fewer businesses - but it is a lovely place to visit. Check out Vacasa's offerings in this quiet region (or any of our other fantastic Oregon Coast vacation rentals) and enjoy a serene beach getaway.

With the ocean just a few miles west, and places such as Tillamook 15 miles north, Pacific City 13 miles down the highway, and Lincoln City just 30 miles south, the amenities of larger towns are not far away. With lush forests and plenty of small streams providing a gorgeous backdrop, you will love the tranquility of the region. And, with the Nestucca River that flows right through town, as well as the majestic ocean a short drive away, plus many state parks to explore, you will have many opportunities to take in the sights of the Northern Oregon Coast.

When you stay at one of our Oregon Coast vacation rentals near Beaver, you will enjoy a comfortable and inviting home surrounded by peace, quiet, and the beauty of nature.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Bend/
With Mt.

Bend offers all of the highlights of the Pacific Northwest (outdoor recreation, amazing beer, locally-sourced cuisine), plus 300 days of sunshine for a true year-round destination.

The Deschutes River winds through the city, offering a beautiful riverside trail for biking and jogging in the summer, and snowshoeing in the winter. Get to know the river a little better by kayak, or book a guided trip on a whitewater raft or with a fly-fishing pole in hand. For even more adventure, try your hand at rock climbing, or head underground on a caving expedition. There are numerous golf courses to choose from, and miles of trails of varying difficulty to keep all cyclists happy. All that exercise works up quite an appetite, and Bend is ready for you! Your options range from fine-dining to homespun cafes, but you might pass them all by in favor of the wonderful brewpubs that have sprung up over the last decade. The city even offers an atlas and passport as you explore the Bend Ale Trail. The downtown area and the Old Mill District, a former industrial zone turned entertainment area, are prime destinations for shoppers and dining. If you feel like exploring a bit, the nearby town of Sisters is only 20 miles north. Home of the Annual Sisters Rodeo in June, this nearby town has a real Western vibe with shops, galleries and restaurants. Staying in a Bend vacation home is a wonderful way to experience this unique city. Sip your morning coffee on your cozy front porch, or stroll downtown to a local cafe for a cappuccino. Stock up on the freshest, most local groceries at the seasonal farmers' market, and enjoy Oregon's bounty in the comfort of your own kitchen. Several of our vacation rentals have cozy fireplaces for chilly winter nights, and a few offer pet-friendly accommodations for a very dog-friendly town. Whether your plans take you to the top of Mt. Bachelor or just to the brewery around the corner, you'll thoroughly enjoy coming back to your cozy Bend vacation rental.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Boring/
When you think of a Mt. Hood vacation rental, small, unassuming Boring, Oregon may not be your first choice. But, this friendly, peaceful community just 23 miles east of Portland is home to many restaurants, the Springwater Trail runs through town, and from here, you're only about 33 miles from skiing and snowboarding at Mt. Hood Skibowl, with other ski resorts right nearby. Boring even has a European sister city - Dull, Scotland. Like Molalla, a Boring vacation home is situated to easily enjoy many outdoor activities, but without the crowds. Spend the day at the Mountain View Golf Course, with its 18-holes and gorgeous views of the Cascade Mountain Range - this golf course also has a pro shop and on-site restaurant. Barton Park, just south of town, is a large natural area with fishing, a boat ramp, picnic area, and wildlife viewing. Spend a warm, sunny afternoon tubing in McIntyre Reservoir or kayaking along the Clackamas River, before returning back to your getaway to relax with a beer and some burgers on the outdoor grill. May through September, the Boring Farmers Market is open on Saturdays, from 10AM-3PM. Pick up some fresh vegetables or even eggs for a meal back at your Boring getaway, or even some arts and crafts to bring home from your vacation! But often times, the country roads here are lined with farmstands selling berries and vegetables, so you may be able to pick up a garden bounty any day of the week! And if you don't feel like cooking, Boring has a number of eateries - The Not So Boring Bar and Grill, Nuts on Sports Pizza, and in the mornings, be sure to stop by Knospe's Keen Bean Coffee. A Boring vacation rental puts you near all the activities in both Clackamas County and the greater Mt. Hood region, but with a laid-back pace and few crowds to cramp your style.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Black-Butte-Ranch/
For a sunny, fun-filled family getaway at a Central Oregon vacation rental, look no further than Black Butte Ranch!

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Brookings/
Vacasa's growing selection of Brookings, Oregon vacation rentals are ideally-situated to make the most of your getaway to the wild and scenic Southern Oregon Coast! This unique community is sometimes refereed to as "Oregon's Banana Belt," for its year-round sunny and warm weather - in fact, summer days in the 80's are not uncommon here. Just 30 miles to the south of Gold Beach and about seven miles from the California state line, Brookings offers gorgeous warm days and cooler nights for watching the stars from the beach or even roasting marshmallows around your Brookings beach cottage's backyard fire pit.

And while the beach, Macklyn Cove, and numerous tide pools at Harris Beach State Park are a huge draw to this magical Oregon Coast spot, Brookings is much more than just sand, surf, and starfish (although there is plenty of those)! There's a botanical garden to explore, the Oregon Redwoods Trail for glimpses of these historic, giant trees, and at the Port of Brookings Harbor you can have access to public boat ramps for a day out on the water, fishing for dinner. This harbor is known for its access to both the Pacific Ocean and Chetco River for Chinook salmon, as well as deep water steelhead, ling cod, and Dungeness crab.

What else can you do when you leave your Brookings beach cottage for the day? Well, golfers will want to schedule time at the Salmon Run Golf Course and for water sports enthusiasts, Sporthaven Beach is known for great surfing and body boarding. And in summer, the water is warm enough that you will probably not even need a wetsuit. From one of our Brookings, Oregon vacation rentals, you can also head to Sporthaven Beach to do a little whale watching in winter and spring.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Brightwood/
Biking, hiking, fly fishing, snowshoeing, skiing - a Mt. Hood vacation rental in Brightwood puts you right in the middle of the Mt. Hood National Forest and all of its stellar year-round outdoor activities! But what of this little town with the unique name? Local history has it that in 1891, one Mr. Alcorn was so impressed with the way the spring sunlight lit up the cottonwoods around the "Salmon" post office (named after the nearby river), he dubbed the place, "Brightwood." It stuck. More than a century later, this charming mountain town isn't much bigger. A Brightwood vacation rental in the beautiful Mt. Hood region is right near the confluence of the Sandy and Salmon Rivers, what's outside the little village accounts for much of the draw. Reaching out like tendrils from just beyond the village are no less than 17 bike trails of varying lengths and difficulties, making Brightwood a cyclist's paradise. One of the most popular, the Sandy Ridge Trail, follows the Sandy River and meanders through a scenic wilderness, heavily populated with native trees and wildlife. You'll definitely want to pack your camera as well as your water bottle. Sandwiched between two rivers, it's also no surprise that one of the town's most popular pastimes is fishing. Go out on your own on the Sandy River or book a fly fishing adventure with The Fly Fishing Shop in nearby Welches. Whether it's biking, hiking, or fishing, Brightwood has all the recreational perks one would expect to find in a mountain forest at an elevation of 1,164 feet. And after a day's adventure, make your way to the Brightwood Tavern for beer, food, and to hang out with the locals. In winter, it's not far at all to many of the popular ski slopes that call the area around Mount Hood their home. Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood Skibowl, and Mount Hood Meadows are all within a 30 minute drive and snowshoeing and cross country skiing are even closer in the surrounding national forest back country. Brightwood is one of the unincorporated communities in the Mount Hood Corridor and easily accessible via Oregon's I-84 east and Scenic Byway (Highway 26). Only about an hour east of Portland, it's just a short, scenic drive before you reach your charming Brightwood vacation rental in the Mt. Hood forest, where good times abound and the trees are ablaze with sunlight!

But that's not all! In addition to its own airport, Cascade Locks has great dining, a marina and boat launch, grocery stores and shops. For sailors, there are the Columbia Gorge Racing Association Regattas. Cyclists can show their stuff on the Cascade-to-Crown Bicycle Ride. At Marine Park, you can hop on the Columbia Gorge Sternwheeler and experience the river the way old timers like Mark Twain did. Or, head over to the Historical Museum and check out the artifacts, photographs, and history of the region. Cascade Locks really is a gateway to the region, with a central location that makes it easy to explore both urban attractions and outdoor adventures. It's less than an hour to Portland and only 20 minutes to Hood River, so there's always a great restaurant or award-winning brewery within easy reach.

Just across the town's Bridge of the Gods, on the Washington side of the Columbia, more strenuous adventures beckon with steeper trails leading up to panoramic viewpoints at Beacon Rock and Table Mountain. Cascade Locks, though, is the lowest point on the Pacific Crest Trail, a journey that takes hikers from the Mexican border in California to the Canadian border. Each August, the city hosts a fundraiser for the trail on Thunder Island in the Columbia. If you're around in November, kick-start your holiday spirit with the annual "Lighting of the Bridge," when the structure is decked out in its holiday garb. In December, the city finishes its Christmas decorating with its "Festival of Light." No matter what time of year you stay in a Cascade Locks vacation rental, you're in for a memorable, fun-filled getaway!

The tiny community of Cape Meares is known to its longtime residents one of the Northern Oregon Coast's best-kept secrets. The area is part of the famous Three Capes Scenic Drive, and includes the beautiful Cape Meares State Park with its charming lighthouse. An Oregon Coast vacation rental in Cape Meares is the place to come for jaw-dropping ocean views and peaceful relaxation, while still keeping close to the dining and shopping options of nearby Tillamook and Oceanside.

Without a doubt, the number one attraction near town is the Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint. The small but impressive park is home to both the shortest lighthouse and the largest Sitka Spruce in Oregon, as well as some of the Coast's best views over the crashing Pacific Ocean. The viewpoints in the park are known as a prime whale-watching spot during migration season, and a favorite nesting grounds for sea birds, including the common murre, bald eagle, and peregrine falcon. On clear days, visitors might catch a glimpse of the tufted puffins and Steller sea lions who enjoy protected breeding grounds at the Three Arch Rocks Natural Wildlife Refuge to the southwest of Cape Meares.

Many vacationers along the Oregon Coast pass through Cape Meares as they journey along the Three Capes Scenic Route, a 40-mile loop drive that meanders along the shoreline from Pacific City to Tillamook. Even on rainy days, when you might be tempted to hunker down in your cozy Cape Meares beach cottage, the well-marked path at Three Capes is worth an afternoon's exploration, showing off some of Oregon's most panoramic viewpoints in state parks at Cape Lookout and Cape Kiwanda. Along the sandy beach of Cape Meares and in the surrounding parks, visitors can enjoy some of the best hiking, kayaking, kite-flying, crabbing, fishing, and birdwatching in the state.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Depoe-Bay/
For a small town, Depoe Bay certainly has a mighty big reputation. This little village has become known as the "Whale Watching Capital of the Oregon Coast", and indeed, it draws a large number of visitors during peak weeks to the state's official Whale Watching Center downtown. An Oregon Coast vacation rental in Depoe Bay is still certainly quieter than Lincoln City to the north and Newport to the south, but thanks to its whale-watching fame, has more dining and shopping options available than many similarly-sized coast towns.

And while a Depoe Bay vacation rental offers all the usual suspects in the way of local businesses (saltwater taffy, art galleries, and souvenir shops), there are definitely some better-than-average restaurant options in town, along with the award-winning Pirate Coffee Company. If you don't feel like preparing meals in your beach cottage's full kitchen, lucky diners can choose from four-star farm-to-table cuisine at Restaurant Beck, the insanely popular seafood spot Tidal Raves, or the Friday night seafood buffet at The Sea Hag, just to name a few.

Newport's famous aquarium, historic waterfront, and Rogue Brewing are only 20 minutes south; to the north, Lincoln City offers miles of sandy beaches, a lively nightlife scene, an outlet mall, and a casino.

Eugene also has its share of great seasonal events - there's the Cinema Pacific Film Festival in spring, the Oregon Bach Festival in summer, McKenzie River Chainsaw Art Festival in August, or you can attend an Oregon Ducks football game during the school year.

As one of the most active cities in the west, Eugene is well known for outdoor activities - cycling, running, and kayaking on the Willamette and McKenzie Rivers are all popular here. The Mount June Trail in nearby Cottage Grove is a 4.6 mile trail uphill that rewards hikers with amazing panoramic views of the Willamette Valley and the mountain peaks of both the Cascade and Coast Ranges. For golfers, the Laurelwood Golf Course is a 9-hole course with challenging hilly terrain and beautifully landscaped greens. And only about an hour from your well-appointed Eugene cottage, heading either west or east will take you to the Oregon Coast for surfing in the Pacific Ocean or the Cascade Mountains for skiing or snowshoeing.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Garibaldi/
Garibaldi is a little bigger than most of the blink-and-you'll-miss-them towns that line Highway 101 along the Northern Oregon Coast, but not much.

Along the Southern Oregon Coast, just 12 miles south of Reedsport and 16 miles north of Coos Bay, a Lakeside vacation rental offers a small town charm, right near the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.

Bordered on the east by North Tenmile Lake and Tenmile Lake, this area is also haven for boating enthusiasts! Spend your days navigating the famous sand dunes with your ATV, then return to your Lakeside vacation rental for some R&R on the deck or use your full kitchen to whip up a home-made meal.

William M. Tugman State Park is just north of town and is often over-looked by Oregon Coast travelers but here you can fish, swim, or boat on Eel Lake, hike along scenic trails, or pack a picnic lunch to enjoy after a full day of exploring this peaceful, natural area.

After working up an appetite, there are a couple of restaurants to choose from right in Lakeside and if you cast a bit of a wider net, you'll have even more dining options if you include neighboring Reedsport and Coos Bay.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/La-Pine/
A quiet and peaceful Central Oregon vacation rental in relaxed, laid-back La Pine offers a landscape of tall trees and tranquility near Oregon's high desert region. Close to Cascade Lakes, the Deschutes National Forest, and the one-of-a-kind Newberry National Volcanic Monument, when you stay here, you'll understand why the city's slogan is, "The Outdoors at Your Front Door."

Day trips are easy from La Pine! This small community is just 18 from Sunriver Resort, 30 miles from bustling Bend, 45 miles from Eagle Crest Resort, and 51 miles from Sisters, a La Pine vacation home offers a central location for this beautiful, rugged, western landscape.

But since you'll have a full kitchen back at your La Pine getaway, your favorite vacation meal may just be the one you make yourself!

Golfers will want to spend time at the Quail Run Golf Course with its 18 holes set amongst panoramic mountain views and at La Pine State Park, visitors can hike, fly fish for trout in the Little Deschutes River, and view Oregon's largest ponderosa pine, dubbed "Big Red." You may even spot a bald eagle or red-tailed hawk flying overhead!

A La Pine vacation rental will put you right near hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, or just relaxing on your comfortable patio. Mt. Bachelor is only 35 miles away for winter skiing and snowboarding and there are miles of back-country trails for snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and even snowmobiling that can be found right near Newberry National Volcanic Monument.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Hebo/
Hebo, a small town along Highway 101 on the Northern Oregon Coast, may not have many businesses or any ritzy attractions, but it does have a tranquil atmosphere and plenty of nature's beauty to share with visitors.

Check out our selection of Oregon Coast vacation rentals near Hebo and try staying in a quiet, peaceful area surrounded by gorgeous sights. With larger cities nearby, such as Tillamook 20 miles north, Lincoln City a quick 25-mile drive south, and the charming Pacific City just 10 minutes down the road, you will have plenty of urban attractions within a short drive. And, with the ocean just a few miles west, you can easily drive over for a stroll on the sand.

From town you can take a rustic eight-mile drive up to Mt. Hebo, which inspired the name of the community. From the windy mountaintop you will enjoy 360-degree views that include the shimmering ocean, vast forests, and the Coast Range Mountains. This area is also popular with hikers, and offers several different trailheads that will take you miles around the secluded and beautiful area.  Elsewhere in the region are plenty of other ways to enjoy the great outdoors, whether you prefer riding ATVs at Sand Lake Recreation Area, fishing in the Nestucca River that passes right by town, driving west to walk along the beach, or seeking out your own adventures.

When you stay at one of Vacasa's cozy and welcoming Oregon Coast vacation rentals, you will be ready to get the most out of your trip to the Hebo area!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Hood-River/
From windsurfing on the Columbia River to skiing at Mt. Hood Meadows in the winter, a stay in a Hood River vacation rental brings fun and adventure year round! In addition to its year-round outdoor activities, Hood River offers a small town charm, paired with amazing restaurants, galleries, award-winning breweries, and wineries featuring Columbia Gorge AVA (American Viticultural Area) wines. Of course, the Columbia River takes center stage here. In the warmer months, the Gorge's heady winds make this outdoor recreation mecca the wind-surfing capital of the world. Abundant outfitters have all the gear a novice adventurer might need, from wetsuits to private lessons; if windsurfing's not your thing, consider kiteboarding, stand up paddle boarding, kayaking, or good old-fashioned sailing. The surrounding Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area is bursting with hiking trails and hidden waterfalls, as well as some of the state's best single-track for mountain bikers at Post Canyon. When the snow falls, the trails become a snowshoer or cross-country skier's paradise; for more thrilling rides, locals head up the mountain to Cooper Spur or Mt. Hood Meadows for alpine skiing and snowboarding. Long before Hood River became the place to be for windsurfing, its was renowned for its apples and pears. (It is regarded as one of the premier producers of Anjou pears in the world.) The scenic Hood River Fruit Loop meanders through the valley, with ample opportunities to buy uber-local produce, jams, and honey at picturesque farm stands. Take your tasty haul back to your Hood River cabin for the next day's breakfast, or make it a picnic at one of the surrounding wineries with stunning Mt. Hood views. Downtown Hood River is definitely the go-to spot for wining and dining in the Columbia Gorge region. Today, not only are there more than a dozen wineries along the Hood River, the area is also home to award-winning breweries like Full Sail, Double Mountain, and Pfriem. The level of quality in food, beer, wine, and coffee makes sense. Although small and charming, this is no backwater town: Hood River is home to several booming businesses in tech industries, clothing and sports equipment manufacturers, and even vegetarian food manufacturer Turtle Island Foods, makers of Tofurky! For adventure enthusiasts, beer lovers, window shoppers, or simply travelers who want to sit back and relax with an amazing view of the Columbia River or Mt. Hood, there are few spots better to call home than a Hood River vacation rental.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Mapleton/
Mapleton is a small town tucked away on the Siuslaw River and surrounded by the serene forest. Come stay in one of our Mapleton rentals and experience for yourself the charms of this lovely area.

This wonderful community is about an hour directly west of Eugene, and just 15 minutes from charming Florence. Mapleton is situated about 15 miles inland from the ocean, so guests of our Mapleton rentals can easily drive over to Highway 101 and drive north to visit the uncrowded beaches of Yachats or south to Waldport or south to Reedsport and North Bend to explore the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.

The most popular restaurant in the area, Pop's Smokehouse (formerly Gingerbread Village), is perched right on the edge of town. Go there for some fish and chips, a pulled-pork sandwich, or a burger, and don't forget to order some gingerbread for dessert! In Mapleton you will find a couple other eateries (including the wonderful Caffeination Station coffee shop), a market, and a hardware store. With Florence so close, you can easily drive into the larger town to stock up on groceries, visit the casino, grab a meal at one of the many restaurants, or go to the beach. Just south of Mapleton about ten miles is the Sweet Creek Falls Trail, where you can hike the short trails that pass through the shaded forest. Walk along the gentle paths and admire the ferns and pine trees, watch for wildlife, and gaze at the small waterfalls. The Siuslaw River passes right through Mapleton, and it is an excellent place to go fishing or boating. And of course, if you drive closer to Florence you can go clamming during low tide or crabbing from the boardwalk in town. Mapleton is a small, quiet town surrounded by the beauty of nature, yet still within an easy drive of larger cities such as Florence and Eugene. When you stay in one of our Mapleton rentals you will never be far from excitement!

The Best Little Beach House on the Oregon Coast!

Lincoln City, a long string of coastal towns that merged together back in the 1960s, is usually regarded as the transition point between the Northern and Central Oregon Coast. One of the most popular Oregon Coast vacation rental destinations for weekenders, Lincoln City offers more restaurants, nightlife, shopping, and entertainment options than most coastal towns. Of course, that does mean more crowds, but there are enough hidden-away beaches and off-the-beaten-path hikes nearby to provide plenty of peace and quiet. Some of the finest restaurants on the Coast, both high-end and laid-back, can be found near your Lincoln City vacation rental. Settle in for a locally-sourced meal at the Blackfish Cafe, splurge on a luxurious dinner at The Bay House, or simply grab a makeshift picnic at J's Fish & Chips, in any case, visitors to Lincoln City have no excuse not to eat well. For post-dinner (or pre-dinner) drinks, the options include the trusty Old Oregon Tavern, a McMenamins brewpub, and the locally beloved Snug Harbor Bar & Grill. There are few coastal towns better equipped to entertain visitors on a rainy day. In addition to movie nights at your cozy beach house, you can catch a flick at the classic Bijou Theater, or the less-classic multiplex down the street. Try your luck at the nearby casino, and then spend your winnings at the massive Tanger Outlet Mall. For higher-brow tastes, visit one of the town's fine art galleries, learn to blow glass, or take a cooking class at the Culinary Center. Of course, the great outdoors is the real reason to stay at a Lincoln City vacation rental. Seven miles of sandy beach provides ample space for surfing, kite flying, sand castle building, beach combing, and birdwatching. Devil's Lake, just east of Lincoln City, offers fishing, canoeing, windsurfing, and jet skis (rentals available), or take a surfing lesson on the beach at Safari Town Surf. For a slower pace, head south of downtown to the historic Taft neighborhood, which provides a bit of quieter charm and access to the wildlife refuge at Siletz Bay. Or, get even closer to the wildlife on a kayak tour from Kayak Tillamook. Lincoln City is only two hours from Portland, and approximately an hour and a half from both Salem and Corvallis. The aquarium at Newport is only 35 minutes south, and the slower-paced beach towns of Neskowin and Pacific City are a short drive to the north. Yes, Lincoln City may be a bit more crowded than other towns along the Central Oregon Coast but there are some very good reasons for its popularity.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Lincoln-Beach/
Lincoln Beach is a small residential community, nestled between the resorts of Gleneden Beach and the whale-watching mecca at Depoe Bay. Visitors to an Oregon Coast vacation rental at Lincoln Beach (not to be confused with nearby Lincoln City) find more peace and quiet than in most nearby towns, while still staying within a short drive of the region's most popular attractions. Even better, the state parks and scenic viewpoints nearby offer some of the most beautiful vistas along the Central Oregon Coast. A few miles south of town, the Otter Crest Loop provides an exceptionally thrilling overview of the region's highlights. Strolling the wooden footbridges and sandy shoreline of Fogarty Creek State Park, which begins at the south end of town, offers some of the best birdwatching and tide pool viewing in the state. A Lincoln Beach vacation rental has the staples of a small coastal town, including a grocery store and a coffee shop, and the surrounding towns offer a wide variety of dining, shopping, and entertainment options. A five minute drive up Highway 101 (or a long walk along the beach) sits Gleneden Beach and the posh Salishan resort, which includes a golf course, spa, shops, and restaurants. Ten minutes further is Lincoln City, with a lively dining scene, outlet mall, casino, movie theater, and plenty of souvenir shops. Heading south, Depoe Bay is only a five-minute drive from Lincoln Beach, and offers a handful of quality restaurants, shops, and plenty of opportunities for whale-watching! Within half an hour, visit Newport's famous aquarium, historic waterfront, and numerous restaurants and breweries. Lincoln Beach sits only an hour and a half from Salem and Corvallis, and just under two and a half hours from Portland. For a quiet, cozy beach house to call home, but still within easy reach of all the attractions of the Central Oregon Coast, consider the sandy shores of Lincoln Beach.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/McMinnville/
McMinnville, Oregon, is the perfect destination for anyone who loves wine and nature. Gently sloping hills give way to grape-studded land in this picture-perfect town, named for one of the Oregon Trail pioneers. Its location at the confluence of the North and South forks of the Yamhill River - just 35 miles southwest of Portland - makes it an ideal wine-growing destination. With 10 wineries and three vineyards in the local AVA, it's a top-draw for wine lovers from around the world. Any of our McMinnville vacation rentals would be a great base from which to explore this growing wine region.

Wine is king in McMinnville, and when you include the surrounding hillsides of Oregon Wine Country, you'll have to make a weekend out of sipping and sampling. Two of the town's best wineries are Coeur de Terre and Yamhill Valley Vineyards. The former is a family-run winery known for its stellar estate-grown pinot noir; the latter, a 150-acre estate with award-winning pinot noir and pinot gris.

McMinnville is in the heart of the Willamette Valley, and is a great base from which to explore the entire region, from Newberg and Carlton to Dundee and Yamhill. The surrounding towns boast dozens of additional wineries for your imbibing pleasure, as well as myriad restaurants headed by star chefs crafting award-winning cuisine.

If wine is not your thing, head to the Evergreen Air & Space Museum. This expansive complex celebrates our nation's aviation and space history, and our war veterans as well. Guests can explore the interior of two planes, the Spruce Goose and the Flying Fortress, a B-17 bomber. After a day touring the museum, the kids will love the Wings and Waves Waterpark, situated inside the museum, which boasts 10 challenging waterslides.

Take a jaunt downtown from your McMinnville lodging to admire the more than 19 pieces of public art on display throughout the historic district, courtesy of the McMinnville Downtown Association Committee for Public Art. The Yamhill County Historical Society boasts two buildings featuring historical artifacts, from vintage farm equipment and quilts to Native-American baskets and stools.

Local boutiques and farm stands abound throughout the town, and offer plenty of goods. Grab a picnic and head to one of the area parks for a day of relaxation. City Park houses the McMinnville Aquatic Center and is the town's first green space. Joe Dancer Park boasts 100 acres of playground as well as wetland trails and a skate park. At the end of a fun-filled but exhausting day, you know you're in good hands at one of our McMinnville vacation rentals.

Wine and nature collide in this lovely town, and our McMinnville, Oregon rentals will make sure your stay is a memorable one!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Molalla/
A bit to the southwest, a Mt. Hood vacation rental in the small town of Molalla is loaded with outdoor activities. From your Molalla getaway, you can follow along the scenic Molalla River Corridor and view numerous waterfalls and geological features, hike, bike, skateboard, and shop to your heart's content. Just as you would expect, being located along a river corridor gives you access to numerous river-related activities like rafting and fishing. But Molalla is also known for its famed "Buckeroo Rodeo" where cowboys and cowgirls can tighten their chaps and test their equestrian skills with varying events beginning in April and ending in September. But that's not all! There are five city parks in Molalla, one devoted to skateboarders. Did you ever want to try sky-diving? Well, you can do that in Molalla too. SkyDive Oregon is located just west of town and caters to both first-timers and experienced skydivers. Hungry for more than adventure? In town, dining options are plentiful. Hit the Hitchin' Post Cafe for hearty breakfasts like the locals do. The Farmstead Restaurant and Pub at Arrowhead Golf Club features live music and eclectic, home-cooked meals. From Molalla, a trip to the outlet malls in Canby is less than a 15 mile drive and St. Josef's Winery is an even shorter trip at only 10 miles. Whether you pick a cabin near the river or your own private lodge, find a perfect Molalla vacation rental in this little town on the western edge of the Cascades.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Manzanita/
Twenty minutes south of bustling Cannon Beach sits the sleepy town of Manzanita. With seven miles of sandy shoreline, an excellent handful of local businesses, and a laid-back vibe to soothe even the busiest soul, it's one of the best-kept secrets on the Northern Oregon Coast. An Oregon Coast vacation rental in Manzanita is the ideal destination for travelers who enjoy staying in a low-key environment with beautiful sandy beaches, but still having easy access to amenities such as grocery stores, coffee shops, and even a sports pub. The town of Manzanita is nestled at the base of Neahkahnie Mountain, a 1600-foot peak that juts out into the Pacific Ocean from the coast, providing a spectacular backdrop to the scenery along the beach. For hiking enthusiasts, trekking up to the Neahkahnie summit on a clear day is a must; the views along the shoreline down to Tillamook Bay are magnificent, and make the challenging climb well worth the effort. For those who prefer less strenuous activity, from your charming beach house, take a long walk along Manzanita's beach stretches from the base of the mountain to the Nehalem Bay Jetty, where seals lounge on rocks as pelicans and eagles fly overhead. Get up close and personal with the nearby Nehalem Bay on a coastal kayak tour. The town itself has just enough retail and restaurant options to meet the needs of most travelers, while feeling considerably more intimate than the more developed downtowns of Cannon Beach and Seaside. Along the main drag of Laneda Avenue, visitors can enjoy cardamom cinnamon rolls at the Bread & Ocean Bakery, a cold pint at the San Dune Pub, a well-earned massage at Spa Manzanita, and pick out a floatable Frisbee at Four Paws on the Beach; after all, Manzanita is one of the most dog-friendly spots along the Coast and we have a number of pet-friendly Manzanita vacation rentals to choose from! The town even offers a natural-foods grocery and a few lovely bookstores, perfect for browsing on rainy days. A Manzanita vacation rental will put you just fifteen minutes south of Cannon Beach's upscale boutiques and galleries, and within half an hour of Seaside's bustling boardwalks. Heading south along Highway 101, the fisheries and seafood markets near Rockaway Beach are only twenty minutes away and the bigger-city amenities (along with a certain cheese factory) are within a forty-minute drive to Tillamook. Manzanita is just under two hours' drive from Portland, and four hours from Seattle, making it easily accessible but certainly isolated and intimate enough to provide a truly relaxing Oregon Coast experience.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Mosier/
The community of Mosier has both an interesting history and a proximity to a myriad of outdoor activities going for it. From your own private Mosier vacation rental, you'll be able to discover all that makes this little town on the Columbia River something special! From cycling paths to windsurfing, Mosier offers world-class recreation and adventure, along with a delightful small-town charm that makes it a wonderful option for a Columbia River Gorge vacation rental. Mosier itself offers a handful of local businesses to meet travelers' most urgent needs - stop by 10 Speed Coffee for a morning cup, or head to Thirsty Woman Pub after a day's hike for a more potent kind of brew. There's also a small market for groceries. If you'd like a little more variety, you'll find that breweries, fine dining, and cafes abound in nearby Hood River, just seven quick miles down the highway. If you prefer to pedal your way to dinner, you're in luck. A pedestrian and bicycle route passes through the historic Mosier Twin Tunnels State Park, traveling through two historic tunnels along the Columbia River Scenic Highway just west of town. This cycling path is a must-ride attraction for bikers - and if you're looking for more challenging trails, stop in one of the cycle shops and ask for a map of the nearby Post Canyon single-track area! From your Mosier vacation rental, visit one of the many orchards in the area and pick your own world-renowned pears and apples. Or, check out one of the 19 wineries in the area and experience the sun-soaked, Columbia Gorge grape. In the winter, Mt. Hood Meadows offers alpine skiing and snowboarding, 40 miles up the mountain. If you're seeking a Columbia Gorge vacation rental that's convenient to recreation - but not too touristy - a Mosier vacation home may be the perfect choice!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Neskowin/
Just twenty minutes north of busy Lincoln City sits little Neskowin, one of the most pleasant "forgotten" towns along the Oregon Coast. Other than a historic golf course and a smattering of vacation getaways, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in sleepy Neskowin has few reasons to attract visitors or day-trippers. Yet the former fishing village has been known to charm those who do come here, bringing them back year after year to enjoy the area's ethereal beaches and hidden secrets. And, of course, all the restaurants, shopping, and entertainment one could desire are just a short drive down Highway 101 to Lincoln City. Neskowin's best-known landmark is Proposal Rock, a tree-topped rocky island named by an early settler after her daughter got engaged on the rock around the end of the 19th century. It's still known as one of the most romantic spots along the Oregon Coast. Other unique geographic features make strolling the beach in Neskowin especially engaging. A "ghost forest" of tree stumps, likely thousands of years old, appears during certain times along the beach, curiously protected, instead of eroded, by the sand and mud along the shore. The lack of crowds make this seemingly endless stretch of sand almost ethereal, and one of the most rewarding places to seek solitude along the coast. Of course, there are a number of more active ways to spend time while enjoying your Neskowin vacation rental. The hike along the Cascade Head Nature Preserve is one of the best along the coast. Kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and golfing are among the other popular activities in Neskowin. The town does have a small local market and a lovely art gallery, but the primary attraction here is certainly the beautiful beach. For additional dining and shopping options, Neskowin sits only fifteen minutes south of charming Pacific City (with its well-known Pelican Pub & Brewery) and twenty minutes north of tourist-friendly Lincoln City. A beach escape to a Neskowin vacation rental is just two hours from Portland, less than an hour and a half from Salem, and five hours from Seattle. The Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, the Cheese Factory in Tillamook, and the beautiful lighthouses along the Three Capes Scenic Drive are all within an hour of town... but once you experience the quiet allure of Neskowin, you may not want to leave at all.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/North-Bend/
Featuring an interesting location - surrounded on two sides by Coos Bay (the water mass) and two sides by Coos Bay (the city) - North Bend is a wonderful place to visit if you want a small-town atmosphere with no shortage of natural beauty. With the ocean, the famous sand dunes, rivers, and forests nearby, and all the amenities of a city, North Bend is one of the undiscovered hotspots of the coast. When you stay at one of our North Bend lodging options, or any of our Southern Oregon Coast vacation rentals, you will find yourself comfortable, relaxed, and ready to explore the area!

If you enter town from the north, you will drive across the North Bend Bridge (one of the most iconic on the coast) and have panoramic views of the dunes, forests, and the bay as you cross the mile-long bridge and reach the edge of the city. In North Bend you will find cultural influences of the Native Americans who originally settled this land, and the loggers and millers who lived here during the town's heyday. In fact, logging is still an important industry here, and the influences of Native Americans (especially the Coos tribe, who lend their name to the bay, river, county, and more) can be seen everywhere. The friendly, modern residents who live here now know that historic-and-charming North Bend is a great place to visit. Drive along the main roads - Sherman Avenue and Virginia Avenue especially - and see the mix of historic buildings housing art galleries and antique shops, and the newer buildings which host coffee shops and bookstores. You can go shopping at Pony Village Mall, visit the Coos Historical & Maritime Museum, and try your luck at The Mill Casino. When you choose our North Bend lodging, you will have easy access to all the attractions both in and around the city.

If you're familiar with the Oregon Coast, you know that it has spectacular coastline, ranging from sheer rocky cliffs to soft, supple sand dotted with tiny shells. North Bend may not be right on the ocean, but it's a quick drive over to the sandy shore. In fact, just north of town is the southern border of the famous Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, which is one of the very best places to go ATV-riding, sandboarding, off-roading, and hiking on the majestic sand dunes. From town you can use the public boat launch to explore the large expanse of Coos Bay on your own boat, or you could set out on a fishing charter and try to catch fresh fish for dinner! Around North Bend (and the neighboring city of Coos Bay) you will find plenty of fishers and hunters who will tell you this section of the state is a great place to fill your salmon and deer tags. And, with the ocean, the bay, and rivers nearby, you will have plenty of water available.

While you're visiting, you will find plenty in North Bend to keep you busy. However, if you feel like taking a trip up or down the coast, you can find even more adventures! The Southern Coast is a more sparsely-populated, relaxed part of the state than the coastline to the north. Drive south about 25 miles you will reach lovely Bandon and its cute downtown area, or you could stop in for a round of golf at Bandon Dunes, one of the top-ranked courses in the entire country. If you head north instead, a pleasantly scenic 50-minute drive will take you to wonderful Florence. Of course, you could always stick closer to your North Bend lodging and explore the North Bend/Coos Bay area. With so many restaurants, shops, and historic corners of the town, you will have plenty of ways to keep busy here. And, with the bay, ocean, forests, and the sand dunes all surrounding the city, North Bend is a great place to plan your next Southern Oregon Coast vacation!

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Newport/
Newport is one of the most popular destinations for an Oregon Coast vacation rental for a few very good reasons. This charming seaport sits on the beautiful Yaquina Bay, and is home to a world-class aquarium, a historic working waterfront, quirky museums, and some of the coast's best restaurants and breweries. There's a little something for everyone here at Newport vacation rental.

While many towns along the Oregon Coast boast jaw-dropping views, uncrowded sandy beaches, and fresh-from-the-boat seafood, Newport is special because of the diverse ways visitors can spend their time; this makes it especially well-suited to families. Kids will love exploring the Oregon Coast Aquarium, home to a large number of well-curated exhibits, including giant Pacific octopus, seals, a seabird aviary, and even the ecosystem of shipwrecks. They might also enjoy visiting Mariner Square, home of a Ripley's Believe It or Not! and a wax museum. A visit to the home of Rogue Brewing, dinner at one of Newport's upscale bistros or seafood markets, or a stroll through the galleries of the artsy Nye Beach neighborhood will suit more grown-up tastes.

For the outdoorsy types, a Newport vacation rental is surrounded by some of the region's best parks and recreation sites. South Beach State Park offers guided kayak tours along Beaver Creek; Yaquina Head Outstanding National Area is home to one of the coast's most photographed lighthouses, plus hiking trails and tide pools; and the razor clamming and surfing are superlative at Agate Beach.

Newport is just over two and a half hours from Portland, an hour and a half from Salem, and just one hour from Corvallis. A number of the region's top attractions are within an easy drive from Newport: the whale-watching capital of Depoe Bay (15 minutes), the beaches and nightlife at Lincoln City (25 minutes), and the picturesque villages of Waldport and Yachats are within an hour's drive. No trip to the Central Oregon Coast is complete without a trip to Newport!

The tiny town of Netarts, nestled along the shoreline of the Northern Oregon Coast, is practically synonymous with shellfish. The estuary of Netarts Bay seems like it's been ecologically engineered to produce some of Oregon's best oysters, clams, and crabs. The gray waters are often dotted with charter boats, crab pots dangling overboard in hopes of catching the highly-regarded Dungeness crab. On the shoreline, locals with rakes, buckets, and sometimes just their bare hands dig in the murky sand for cockles, Pacific littlenecks, and Eastern soft-shells... and yes, those are all varieties of clams. No stay at an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Netarts is complete without strapping on some waders and catching your own dinner; but that's not the only reason to visit this friendly fishing village. It's surrounded by some of the coast's most majestic scenery.

Netarts is located just north of Cape Lookout State Park, a favorite hiking and camping destination for Oregon Coast connoisseurs. The park includes the long, sandy Netarts Spit that stretches north of the cape itself, protecting the ecologically rich bay from the crashing waves of the Pacific. Beachcombers consider it a prime location for collecting glass floats and unusual shells. Cape Lookout is part of the Three Capes Scenic Route, a popular driving tour of panoramic ocean views, historic lighthouses, and rural dairy farms.

In addition to fishing, crabbing, and clamming, the surrounding area offers plenty of opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors. From your Netarts vacation rental, head to the beach to enjoy kite-flying, sandcastle-building, surfing, kayaking, and beach combing; further inland, some truly excellent hikes can be reached within a half an hour. Make sure to visit the highest waterfall in the Coast Range, at Munson Creek Falls State Park.

Of course, catching your own dinner is the best way to experience the rich bounty of Netarts Bay; but for the less adventurous, local institution The Schooner offers a more hands-off way to enjoy fresh oysters, clams, and crab. Additional dining options, such as the highly-regarded Roseanna's Cafe, are only two miles up the beach in Oceanside, or Tillamook's numerous choices are only a fifteen minute drive away.

Netarts is optimally located, with all of the region's most popular destinations easily reached within an hour and a half: Astoria, Seaside, and Cannon Beach to the north; Pacific City, Lincoln City, and Depoe Bay to the south. Portland itself is also only an hour and a half from little Netarts. To explore the best of the Northern Oregon Coast while returning home each night to a peaceful little fishing village, a Netarts vacation rental is an unexpectedly delightful option.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Neahkahnie/
Neahkahnie is a tiny beach home community nestled just north of Manzanita. The mostly residential neighborhood offers some of the Northern Oregon Coast's most beautiful stretches of beach, with the lovely cottages giving way to wilderness as Neahkahnie Mountain rises over the rugged coastline. Sunshine is more common along this sheltered stretch of shore than anywhere else along the northern coast. Although a quiet little town, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Neahkahnie offers plenty of options for lively recreation. Nearby Oswald West State Park has a few of the region's best hikes, and surfers swear by the waves at the secluded Short Sands Beach. Stories of long-lost pirates' gold have led many treasure hunters up the Neahkahnie Mountain Summit Trail, although their only (not-too-shabby) reward is a panoramic view south to Cape Meares. Neahkahnie itself offers very little in the way of services or amenities; but the town essentially blends into Manzanita, which has a small but excellent handful of options for dining and shopping, including a few coffee shops, bookstores, and even a sports pub. Even more variety lies to the north, in both Cannon Beach (twenty-five minutes away) and Seaside (half an hour). Comparatively "big-city" shopping and chain restaurants can be found in Tillamook, about forty minutes south. Portland is less than two hours' drive away, and Seattle just under four, making a Neahkahnie vacation rental a hidden gem for those who are looking to get away from the big city for a truly peaceful destination along the Northern Oregon Coast.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Otis/
Traveling between the Willamette Valley's Wine Country and the Central Oregon Coast, you'll pass through the sleepy little town of Otis, Oregon! Just seven miles northeast of Lincoln City, Otis sits near the Coast Range, right by the Salmon River. An Oregon Coast vacation rental in Otis provides easy access to ocean beaches and all the hubbub in town, but with a quiet, inland location near fishing, hiking, and even waterfalls. Plus, because of its geography, while it's cloudy and cold on the coast, the weather in Otis can be sunny and breezy! When you feel like exploring, lace up your hiking boots and visit family and dog friendly Drift Creek Falls, about 12 miles away. From the trailhead you'll travel across a 240-foot long suspension bridge to the 65-foot falls coming off of the Siletz River. Other attractions near your Otis getaway include the Salmon River Hatchery and the Salmon River estuary - here you can observe brown pelicans, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and other types of shore birds. Of course, your favorite Otis pastime may just be relaxing on your back porch, watching the river flow by. However you spend your Otis getaway, be sure to stop by the popular Otis Cafe for a hearty, home-style breakfast like sourdough pancakes or chicken-fried steak and eggs before you head off on a hike or spend the day out exploring the river. At just under two hours from Portland, you can get away from it all in Otis at your very own cabin in the woods right near the Salmon River, the Pacific Ocean, and warm, dry summers.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Otter-Rock/
Travelers seeking a quiet, charming with a world-class location need look no further than an Otter Rock vacation home! Located between bustling Newport and vibrant Lincoln City, visitors will be within easy reach of two of the most popular destinations along the Oregon Coast.

Otter Rock is tucked on a particularly scenic stretch of the Central Oregon Coast, adjacent to Devils Punch Bowl State Natural Area. A favorite of surfers and storm watchers, the churning waters create unbelievable waves, and lively tide pools are ripe for exploring when the tide recedes. Large rock formations off the coast are perfect for exploring by kayak on calmer days!

While the town itself is small, it's certainly not lacking in charm! Settle in for a seafood lunch with outstanding views at an outpost of the popular Mo's chain, or head next door to the Flying Dutchman, one of the only working wineries along the Oregon Coast, for a laid-back afternoon of tasting and picnicking.

While a stay in an Otter Rock vacation rental is a surefire way to find peace and quiet, there are no shortage of entertainment options within half an hour's drive. Newport, just 15 minutes to the south, is home to the Oregon Coast Aquarium, Rogue Brewery, and plentiful shopping and dining along its historic bay front. There are scenic lighthouses to explore and dozens of hiking trails for all types of excursions. Just under 20 miles north is Lincoln City, with its bustling outlet mall, Chinook Winds casino, and even more restaurants and pubs to visit. For more small-town charm, Depoe Bay is even closer to Otter Rock, less than ten minutes up Highway 101. Famous for its whale-watching, Depoe Bay is also the home of the acclaimed Restaurant Beck, an award-winning temple of locally-sourced seafood and foraged cuisine.

Of course, when you're staying in one of our beautiful Oregon Coast vacation rentals, you may just decide to lounge on the deck and breathe in the salty sea air. However you choose to spend your Otter Rock vacation, it's sure to be memorable!

The small coastal town of Pacific City is the kind of place you'll want to rave about to all of your friends... but also keep secret, so it stays exactly like it is. Tucked a few miles west of Highway 101, this charming beach getaway feels a little more remote and secluded than her neighboring towns, and an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Pacific City offers visitors an unexpected take on the Northern Oregon Coast. With a location that sits along the Three Capes Scenic Drive, many who drive through town don't want to leave. Although Pacific City's Haystack Rock is somewhat less famous than its same-named (and shorter) counterpart in Cannon Beach, the impressive sea stack is still the biggest landmark in town. Coming in a close second is the Pelican Pub & Brewery, an award-winning microbrewery with jaw-dropping views of the ocean. Another popular Pacific City attraction is, of course, the beach... particularly since there are a number of sections where driving automobiles is allowed! While Pacific City is a great spot for all the usual day-at-the-beach activities (sand castle building, kite flying, beach combing, surfing, and kayaking), it also offers a few unusual options for recreation. Guests at a Pacific City vacation rental can while away their days horseback riding along the beach, seal watching at the mouth of the Nestucca River, climbing the sand dunes at Cape Kiwanda, and even hang gliding over the shoreline. When the conditions are right, crowds gather in the evenings to watch the dory fleet head home after a long day of fishing. These distinctive flat-bottomed boats don't dock at a pier with their haul of rockfish, tuna, and Dungeness crab; rather, the dorymen drive their boats right up onto the sand where their trailers are waiting. If you don't feel like making a meal back at your beach house's full kitchen, Pacific City has a few other dining & drinking establishments well worth a visit. Though the Pelican Pub is the most popular spot in town, the more upscale Delicate Palate Bistro may not have ocean views, but the seasonally-rotating menu featuring local ingredients is the rightful star here. Laid-back BJ's Burgers & Tacos offers a beachfront vibe and the best value in town. Pacific City sits just two hours from Portland, less than an hour and a half from Salem, and just under five hours from Seattle. While there's plenty to keep vacationers busy in the immediate vicinity, a Pacific City vacation rental makes a great home base to explore the rest of the Oregon Coast. To the north, popular Seaside and Cannon Beach are less than two hours away; Tillamook and its bigger-city amenities can be reached in under forty-five minutes. Heading south, bustling Lincoln City with its shopping and nightlife is just forty minutes away. In just over an hour, the Oregon Coast Aquarium waits in Newport. Pacific City offers the rare combination of being close to all the best attractions of the Oregon Coast, but secluded enough to feel like a true getaway.

Pendleton's motto is "The Real West" and with a stay at one of our Pendleton vacation rentals, you'll get a taste of the vibrant western culture and long pioneer history that this small, friendly town in Central Oregon has to offer. Home to both the famous Pendleton Round-Up and the equally iconic Pendleton Woolen Mills (although now headquartered in Portland, the original plant in Pendleton is one of the few remaining woolen mills in operation today), Pendleton has a lot more going for it besides just cowboys and wool blankets. Not just for gambling, the Wildhorse Resort & Casino, run by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, is about eight miles from the center of downtown, and features a movie theater, live entertainment, an 18-hole golf course, and a number of restaurants, including Plateau - a fine dining experience on the top floor, boasting panoramic views of the nearby Blue Mountains. For more native culture, the casino also houses the impressive TamÃ?Æ?Ã?Â¡stslikt Cultural Institute, with exhibits and events highlighting the area's Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla Tribes. You'll have a full kitchen at your Pendleton vacation home, so be sure to check out the Pendleton Farmers' Market for fresh produce, arts, crafts, and live music on Friday afternoons, from May - October. Art lovers can also head to the Pendleton Center for the Arts for works by both emerging and well-known regional artists. Year-round, outdoor enthusiasts flock to this area for fishing, boating, hiking, and hunting. Less than an hour to the north, the Columbia River offers some of the best salmon, steelhead, and walleye fishing in the region. And closer to home on the Umatilla river, you'll find spring Chinook and trout. But, like the other Central Oregon town of Sisters, the annual rodeo is a huge draw to this community on the banks of the Umatilla River. This annual September event, started in 1910, has been a hugely-popular, yearly tradition ever since. And with a stay at a comfortable Pendleton vacation getaway, you'll have a convenient location for attending all the Pendleton Round-Up activities! At just over three hours from Portland, Pendleton is an adventurous destination. Plan a cultural trip filled with history, art exhibits, and cowboys (and cowgirls), or bring your fishing gear, hiking boots, and bike for an outdoor retreat that you won't soon forget!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Port-Orford/
Nestled along the Southern Oregon Coast, just beyond Floras Lake State Park, you can discover a peaceful and charming destination when you pick from Vacasa's Port Orford lodging options. Just under five hours from Portland, Port Orford will be the setting of a memorable Oregon Coast getaway to this unique seastack-covered shoreline.

Beach comb, fly a kite, build sandcastles - Port Orford has it all! From here, you'll be just 56 miles north of Brookings and about 27 miles south of Bandon. Day trips in either direction, along Highway 101 are a scenic and fun way to spend the day. If you do want to stay near your Port Orford lodging, right in town you can visit Battle Rock, a famous battlesite between opposing forces in 1851. At Port Orford Bay, there are opportunities for wind, board, and body surfing, and in calm weather, you can head out in a canoe or kayak. Visit the Orford Reefs, the sea lion rookery, and keep an eye out for gray whales during the migration seasons.

Throughout Port Orford, there is an extensive trail system winding through town. It's a great way to sight-see on two feet. Other hiking options include nearby  Cape Blanco State Park (also home to an historic lighthouse), the Blacklock Point Trail, Humbug Mountain, and even Buffington Park. Here you can also play miniature golf, horseshoes, basketball, or visit a butterfly and hummingbird garden. And when you work up an appetite, this small town is big on dining options, whether it's Crazy Norwegians for crab melts or the Paradise Cafe for home-style country breakfasts.

When you leave your Port Orford lodging in the morning, one thing is sure - the possibilities are many and the scenery is simply stunning! Photo credit: Mona Makela via Shutterstock
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Parkdale-Mt-Hood/
When you're enjoying your Parkdale vacation rental, you can be pretty sure of one thing: when you're out and about, look over your shoulder, and somewhere you're likely to see Mt. Hood. Though the name "Parkdale" might evoke images of a humble burg somewhere on the plains, the little hamlet is host to the giant adventure and fun the mountain affords. From your Mt. Hood vacation rental visit the town's museum - the Hutson House - and you'll learn that Parkdale was born of economic necessity. In 1910, two railroad men, David Eccles and R. J. McIsaac, decided they needed a place for the Mount Hood Railroad to...well, to come to an end. Parkdale is the final stop on the scenic "Fruit Loop" around the Hood River Valley. In summer, the fruit basket won't be the only thing that's full in this part of Cascade Mountain Range. You'll find a cornucopia of activities around the town of Parkdale. Put on your hiking shoes, grab your camera and head over to Frog Creek Trail or any of the other paths in the Mount Hood National Forest. Grab your tackle box and throw a line into one of 23 fishing spots in the Hood River Ranger District alone. In winter, ski and boarding buffs can ply the slopes at nearby Mt. Hood Meadows or Copper Spur Mountain Resort. When you're hungry, Parkdale offers everything from sandwiches, to steaks, to craft brewed beer. Or, from your Parkdale vacation home, drive the 12 miles north into nearby Hood River where you'll find restaurants to suit any taste. Parkdale may be the last stop on the Scenic Byway, but it's only the beginning of a good time you can enjoy the whole year-round.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Reedsport/
If you want to explore the windswept sandy beaches of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, look no further than a Reedsport vacation rental along the Southern Oregon Coast. Sitting on the beautifully scenic spot where the Umpqua River flows into the Pacific, Reedsport is an ideal destination for outdoors lovers of all kinds.

Between the Umpqua River, inland lakes, and (of course) the ocean, Reedsport is a fisherman's dream. Depending on the season, cast your line for salmon, steelhead, bass, trout, bluegill, or sturgeon. On the coast itself, clamming and crabbing are popular pastimes. The surrounding area is teeming with gorgeous hikes and wildlife watching opportunities.

Of course, Reedsport is most famous for its windswept dunes. The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area stretches for more then 40 miles, from Florence to the north to Coos Bay to the south - and Reedsport is located right in the middle. From hikes to dune buggy rides to sand boarding (think surfing, but on the sand), there are no shortage of ways to experience the singular beauty and adventure of the dunes. Another popular destination is the iconic lighthouse perched near the mouth of the Umpqua River.

Reedsport proper has a small but high-quality selection of dining options, from elk burgers and onion rings at the locally beloved Harbor Light Family Restaurant to freshly made doughnuts at the Sugar Shack Bakery. For rainy day entertainment, visit the award-winning Umpqua Discover Center, or head 30 minutes north to the handful of shops and galleries in lovely Florence, along with a supermarket for stocking up on groceries. For an Oregon Coast vacation rental to call home while you explore the wild and scenic Southern Oregon Coast, consider one of our charming Reedsport getaways in this peaceful, naturally stunning scenic area.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Redmond/
Welcome to Redmond, the heart - literally, the geographical center - of Oregon! From your Redmond vacation rental you'll be right poised on the eastern side of the Cascade Range at an elevation of 3,077 feet. Redmond is located in the High Desert area of the state, a fact that makes Redmond's weather almost a reverse image of Portland's, a mere 143 miles to the north. Whereas annual rainfall in Portland is 37 inches, in Redmond, it's only 8. Conversely, while Portland gets about 7 inches of snow annually, Redmond gets about 20. While Portland enjoys clear skies about 68 days a year, Redmond sees the sun a full 162 days. Translation: Whether you're a hiker, a cyclist, a skier or and angler, Redmond offers the perfect climate and hospitable residents anxious to make your visit fun and memorable any time of year. When you pass under the town's signature "Welcome to Redmond" arch, you're entering small town America, and the city has made a considerable investment in preserving that iconic image. For instance, Centennial Park (opened in 2010) is the core of the city's civic renaissance. It's a pleasant space lined with flowers, trees, tables and chairs where you can sit on the lawn and kids can frolic in the splash park. History buffs can take the Heritage Walk, a walking tour of 29 commercial and residential buildings built between 1910 and 1941. Stroll through boutiques, antique shops, and galleries where local artists offer their works. Choose from 31 restaurants and try one of the craft brews at Cascade Lakes Brewing Company. In summer, head over to the Farmers Market in Centennial Square. Redmond lays claim to one of the world's premier rock-climbing destinations: Smith Rock. With over 1400 climbing routes, Smith Rock is situated on the banks of the Crooked River in a 651-acre state park. Those prone to vertigo can opt for a hike on Misery Ridge Trail, a 3.6 mile hike that loops around the headland's tip, climbs 900 feet to a gorgeous panoramic view, then takes you gently down the backside to where you started. Cyclists will enjoy the crown jewel of Redmond's park system, the Dry Canyon Trail, a 250 acre park that also includes venues for tennis, soccer, baseball and skateboarding, and picnicking. For anglers, try and snag steelhead and rainbow trout in nearby lakes including Billy Chinook, Suttle, and Blue lakes, as well as the Ochoco, Haystack and Prineville reservoirs. Go rafting on the Deschutes River, or hiking at Tam Arthur Rim, Chimney Rock or Dillon Falls Trail. Because of its Central Oregon, High Desert climate, Redmond has some of the driest powder in the Pacific Northwest. Skiers and snowboarders can hit the slopes 35 miles southwest of Redmond at Mount Bachelor or at Hoodoo Ski Bowl, 40 minutes to the west. Snowmobilers will find trails in nearby Deschutes, Ochoco, and Willamette National Forest. The town of Bend is only 17 miles south for a fun day trip filled with brewery hopping, gallery browsing, and exploring Drake Park. And finally, in addition to the ice skating rink right in downtown Redmond, take the kids over to Operation Santa Claus two miles west of the city where you'll find a Christmas-themed working reindeer park with real reindeer! Summer or winter, enjoy the pleasant climate and great hospitality from your Redmond vacation rental, right in the heart of Oregon!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Rowena/
Situated halfway between Hood River and The Dalles, little Rowena, Oregon offers some of the most stunning vistas and geological features in the entire Columbia River Gorge. Travelers looking for a Gorge rental with amazing views and a secluded yet not-too-remote location may find that a Rowena vacation home is just the ticket for their next getaway! A Columbia Gorge vacation rental in Rowena will put you on the Oregon side of a magnificent geologic feature on the Columbia River - chronicled by Lewis and Clark as they passed through - known as the "Rowena Gap." Carved from the unrelenting forces of Cenozoic lava flows and Ice-Age floods, one floating down the Columbia would see The Rowena Gap as terraced mountains on both sides of the river. Six separate basalt flows can be counted in the 1,000-foot-high cliffs. At any time of year, Rowena offers an abundance of beautiful natural scenery to explore. Just to the west is Mayer State Park, set on riverfront land donated by Mark Mayer in 1910. At its base on the river's edge, the park (along with Doug's Beach on the Washington side) has become a favorite launching point for kite and sailboard enthusiasts from around the world. Meander up the Historic Columbia River Highway that runs through the park and you'll be rewarded with stunning views of the Columbia River Gorge from your perch at Rowena Crest. In the spring, the nearby Tom McCall Nature Preserve is 271 acres of land awash with colorful wild flowers of all sorts. Located in the transition zone between the heavily-forested west side of the Cascades and the drier bunch grass prairies of the east, the Preserve explodes with a rainbow of colors. While the area's hiking and scenic viewpoints could keep you (and your camera) busy for weeks, there's more to explore in the surrounding Gorge. The Deschutes River is about 25 miles east with amazing whitewater rafting, as well as steelhead and trout fishing. The bustling town of Hood River, with its dining and shopping, is less than twenty minutes to the west - or head ten miles east to The Dalles for a slower pace and a small-town feel. In the winter, skiing and snowboarding at Mt. Hood Meadows is just under 50 miles away. This unique geologic area is ripe with outdoor activities for adventuresome types, and scenic vistas for those who just want to relax with a good view. However you choose to spend your days, making a Rowena vacation rental your home away from home will leave you with unforgettable memories - and an enviable collection of photographs!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Rhododendron/
Located between Zig Zag and Government Camp, Rhododendron offers all the charm of a small town in the Cascade Mountains. And like those other communities, a Rhododendron vacation rental offers peace and tranquility, with a prime location for enjoying the great outdoors spring, summer, fall, and winter! A Mt. Hood vacation rental is a wonderful retreat at any time of year. Rhododendron isn't far from five different ski resorts in the area, making it an ideal destination for winter sports. The surrounding National Forest lands are ripe with trails for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing in winter, and hiking or mountain biking in the summer. Rhododendron is also, you might say, for the birds. Bring your binoculars, ornithologists, and watch the aviaries on two of the official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails. When you get hungry, the menu in Rhododendron is surprisingly diverse. Not only does the popular coffee roaster Mt. Hood Roasters call the village home, Rhododendron has everything from ice cream to pizza to schnitzel. Whether your passion is schussing downhill, rafting, or fishing, a stay at a Rhododendron vacation rental has something great in store for you!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sandy/
Get to know the incredible Pacific Northwest firsthand by staying in one of our Mt. Hood vacation rentals in Sandy, Oregon! Sandy is truly an outdoor adventure base with its close proximity to the hiking, biking, kayaking, and skiing nestled around the gorgeous Mt. Hood area. With plenty of outdoor activities to choose from, the fantastic cities of Portland and Hood River both within an hour's drive, plus the cute little bars and restaurants right in town, Sandy is a great place to spend some time with friends or family.

Sandy is named after the Sandy River, originally coined the "Quicksand River" by Lewis and Clark, so there are tons of options to choose from for swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, or fishing. This area is beautiful anytime of year, but the summer brings especially great weather for hiking or mountain biking. On a clear day, make sure to head up to Jonsrud Point for a breathtaking view of Mt. Hood.

Sandy is truly the gateway to some of the state's most breathtaking scenery and outdoor adventures, with a huge variety of destinations within an easy hour's drive of our Sandy, Oregon rentals! Hop in the car for a trip up the mountain to the incredible skiing and snowboarding of Timberline, Mt. Hood Meadows, or Ski Bowl. There are also tons of beautiful hidden lakes in this part of Oregon, but both Trillium Lake and Lost Lake are can't-miss alpine escapes.

For an equally beautiful change of scenery, drive north and then east into the Columbia River Gorge to explore "Waterfall Alley", and catch a glimpse of the second-highest waterfall in the country: Multnomah Falls is also only an hour away!

Sandy is an incredible place to visit, not only because of the wonderful outdoor activities available, but also because of its history! Sandy was one of the final destinations on the Oregon Trail, and there are still old buildings from the 1800's hanging around to make you feel like you're back in the pioneer days. You can check out the Sandy Historical Museum for a brief history lesson, head to many of the nearby farms to pick your own food, or check out the Sandy Actor's Theatre for some awesome live entertainment. With the Sandy Mountain Festival, Sandy Oktoberfest, or the Hometown Holiday Festival over the year, there's plenty to celebrate! Plus, there are a few charming restaurants, coffee shops, and bars close to many of our Sandy, Oregon rentals...so you never have to feel too isolated here in the gorgeous Cascade mountains!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sandlake/
Sandlake, Oregon is a tiny, quiet community that serves as a gateway to fantastic coastal activities. When you stay at one of Vacasa's Oregon Coast vacation rentals you will be right next door to the Sand Lake Recreation Area, which has more than 1,000 acres of spectacular sand dunes, as well as a lake, beach access, and plenty of gorgeous scenery.

Though many people pass right by Sandlake without a thought on their way north to Tillamook (16 miles away), or south to Lincoln City, 30 miles down Highway 101, this community has a lot to offer visitors. Although there aren't many businesses in town, the larger Pacific City, just eight miles away, has plenty of places where you can have a nice restaurant meal or stock up on groceries.

Bring along your ATVs to explore the nearby dunes, or try out sandboarding down the slopes. There is also an estuary where you can go fishing, crabbing, and birdwatching, and the beautiful Sand Lake itself is a great place to kayak or swim. And of course, the stunning Pacific Ocean is just past the dunes, so you can also enjoy a nice long stroll on the sand while listening to the waves crash on the shore.

Come stay at one of our cozy and quiet Oregon Coast vacation rentals and be right next to all the action of the sand dunes!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Seal-Rock/
Located about 45 minutes south of Lincoln City (roughly 32 miles), the name of this community is the one consistent link to native inhabitants who perceived this rugged patch of Oregon in much the same way. Since antiquity, the long chain of partially submerged rocks stretching parallel to the shore for about 2.5 miles have indeed played host to seals and sea lions that visitors can observe today from the protected confines of Seal Rock State Recreation Site. Even before it was officially conceived in 1887, the town of Seal Rock was already significant as the final stop of the Corvallis and Yaquina Bay Wagon Road, the first road to reach the coast from the Willamette Valley. Over the decades, schemes for development hatched by waves of lumber interests from as far away as Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin failed to take root. What has endured over the years, however, is Seal Rock's reputation as a resort, a place that somehow has restorative powers even beyond its natural beauty. Needless to say a stay in an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Seal Rock will definitely leave you feeling well-rested and restored. Managed by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, the wildlife at Seal Rock State Recreation Site is "no-fee," and is not just limited to the ever-popular seals. Birds like Murres, Peregrine Falcons, Black Oystercatchers, and the rare Tufted Puffin can be seen here as well. An even greater variety of marine creatures can be seen in the tide pools. Depending on the tide level, you can observe roughly 21 different sea creatures ranching from Giant Green Anemones to Red Sea Cucumbers. Developed for day-use, the park's picnic area is in a pleasant stand of shore pine, spruce and salal. During Christmas and spring breaks, the volunteers of Whale Watching Spoken Here are on hand to help visitors spot passing grays 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. Head 2 minutes north of Seal Rock to Ona Beach State Park where you'll find a great place to launch your boat, take a kayak tour through the Beaver Creek Wetland, take a hike, or fish. Given its abundant environment and kaleidoscope of seascapes and vistas that vary in mood and color depending on the time of day, it's no surprise that Seal Rock has also nurtured a community of artists. Within just a couple miles north and south of the village are galleries where artists offer everything from hand-blown glass, wood carvings, paintings and sculptures. Whether you stay in a Seal Rock vacation rental for the wildlife, the scenery, or the serenity of the unspoiled beaches, you just might feel the same restorative power that so many have felt in this beautiful, pristine area!

The Best Little Beach House on the Oregon Coast!

The small community of South Beach, tucked away on the south side of Yaquina Bay, is only two miles from all the action in Newport's bustling bayfront, but far enough away that an Oregon Coast vacation rental in South Beach offers plenty of peace and quiet. Outdoor activities are plentiful here, with South Beach State Park boasting miles of hiking trails, sandy beaches, and kayak tours of the Beaver Creek area, as well as being a popular spot for water sports like fishing, crabbing, boating, and windsurfing. With its close proximity to Newport, you'll find spending an afternoon with sharks and puffins at the Oregon Coast Aquarium or having a couple of pints at Rogue Ales Public House, both within a five minute drive. The bayfront area also has a number of galleries, small shops, and interesting places to explore and peruse. Deciding on your next meal will be no problem here! South Beach Fish Market has both seafood to take back and prepare at home and fish and chips made to order at the market. And, another scenic trip across the Yaquina Bridge will provide even more dining choices. Visit Local Ocean for Grilled Calamari and Crab Po' Boys or Panini Bakery in historic Nye Beach for coffee drinks, pastries, and take-out pizzas later in the day to bring back and enjoying at your South Beach vacation rental. Head south about eight miles and you will end up at breathtaking Seal Rock for a morning of tide pool exploring, sketching, bird watching, or just walking along the sandy, rocky shore at the Seal Rock State Recreation Site. Closer to home, there's also the family friendly Mike Miller Park Educational Trail, a forty acre park and trail lined with Sitka Spruce, Western Hemlock, Douglas Fir, and Coastal Pine trees. Only two and a half hours from Portland, a South Beach vacation rental offers peace and relaxation, but still close to all of Newport's fun activities. In addition, South Beach is a great home base for a number of Central Oregon's top attractions. Within an hour's drive are: the casinos and beaches at Lincoln City, whale watching in Depoe Bay, and exploring the charming downtown of Florence. Of course, your favorite activity of all may just be relaxing inside your cozy South Beach vacation home with a warm, toasty fire and a good beach read!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sisters/
Only 22 miles northwest of Bend, lies the unique, Western-themed town of Sisters, a laid back, small town pick for a cozy Central Oregon vacation rental. The city's namesake is the Three Sisters - three volcanic mountain peaks in Oregon's Cascade Range and its relatively small population of a little over 2000 inhabitants belies its overabundance of events, outdoor activities, galleries, and opportunities for fun.

Once called "The Biggest Little Show in the World," the town has been the location for the annual Sisters Rodeo every second weekend of June since its start in 1914. Another big draw is the Sisters Folk Festival each year in September. After spending the day cheering on the cowboys (and girls) or celebrating American roots music, you'll want to make your way to Three Creeks Brewing Company for pints of Fivepine Porter and Flatbread Reubens or the Sisters Coffee Company for a caffeine-filled pick-me-up and a homey, log cabin atmosphere. Neither option quite your thing? With more eateries than you would expect from a town its size, don't worry, there's something for everyone's tastes.

Numerous outdoor activities take advantage of the region's lakes, mountains, rivers and natural areas for hiking, biking, skiing, and horseback riding excursions. The Sisters Tie Trail is a six mile pathway that is more of a country stroll than a strenuous workout. The trail runs parallel to Highway 20 and you'll enter the woods, emerging a bit later after an enjoyable country walk. Golfers can practice their swings at not one, but three 18-hole golf courses. Closest to Sisters, Aspen Lakes Golf Course shows off the Cascade Mountain range views and is as challenging as it is scenic.

Mountain bikers can head out to the Peterson Ridge Trail, just south of town. Part of a 25-mile multi-use trail system, riders, joggers, and dog walkers of all levels are accommodated with an easy-to-moderate difficulty level. From your cozy Sisters vacation rental, an excursion to the nearby Metolius River offers a number of activities! A tributary of the Deschutes River, this crystal clear waterway flows for about 37 miles with ample fly fishing spots for catch and release native rainbow trout, Kokonee salmon, and bull trout.

In winter, like a lot of towns in the Cascade Mountain Range, Sisters is close to skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing adventures. Hoodoo Ski Area is about 20 miles from the center of town. With a top elevation of 5,700 feet, Hoodoo offers excellent Alpine skiing, as well as Nordic trails, and for the dare devils, even snowbike lessons. At under 30 miles away, Smith Rock State Park is a prime destination for rock climbers and hikers with picturesque deep river canyons, High Desert rock formations, and wildlife viewing opportunities for golden eagles, prairie falcons, mule deer, and river otter.

From Sisters, another day trip possibility is the resort town of Sunriver, a 45 minute drive south, boasting a state-of-the-art aquatic center, multiple golf courses, and many multi-use trails. Of course, you might just opt to stay close to your Sisters vacation rental and enjoy all the charms this quaint little Western community has to offer. But, before you head home, make sure to stop by Leavitt's Western Wear and pick yourself up a cowboy hat to always remember your Sisters vacation!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Tierra-Del-Mar/
Tiny Tierra del Mar is a residential beach community nestled between Cape Lookout and Cape Kiwanda, removed from the hustle of the highway but still close to all the amenities a vacationer could need. For solitude and scenery, there are few Oregon Coast vacation rental destinations more ideal along the Northern Coast. It's been described as "old-school Oregon Coast"... no coffee shops, no saltwater taffy, just a few lucky residents and a stretch of beautifully deserted beach. While Tierra del Mar itself is quite small and offers few services, comparatively bustling Pacific City is less than ten minutes away. Sip a cold pint at the award-winning Pelican Pub & Brewery, or enjoy a more upscale meal at the Delicate Palate Bistro. Window shopping, surf rentals, and even hang-gliding lessons are all available in the charming beach town. Tillamook's larger selection of dining and shopping is only 35 minutes away, and it's a good stopping point to stock up on groceries before retreating to the solitude of the coast. For a little more excitement, Lincoln City's nightlife, outlet malls, and casino are just 45 minutes south, and the popular destinations of Cannon Beach and Seaside are about an hour and a half north. The area surrounding your Tierra Del Mar vacation rental is full of outdoor activities and can't-miss scenery. The Three Capes Scenic Drive winds through town, and makes for an excellent way to spend the day. The loop takes you through the state parks positioned at each cape, with short hikes leading to panoramic ocean views, historic lighthouses, and some of the tallest heritage trees in the state. The shoreline itself is rarely crowded, making it excellent for beach combing, flying kites, surfing, and even driving your car, which is legal along this stretch of sand. A cozy and charming Tierra del Mar vacation rental sits less than two hours from Portland, and just under ninety minutes from Salem. It's a hidden secret along the Northern Oregon Coast, and a dream come true for those seeking peace and quiet.

Tillamook is the one of the larger cities along the Northern Oregon Coast, sitting just a few miles inland on the southeast corner of Tillamook Bay. The town sits in the middle of very productive dairy country, and has become synonymous with its well-known cheese company. And though the Tillamook Cheese Factory has indeed become one of the area's biggest tourist draws, there is much more than cheddar to an Oregon Coast vacation rental in the town of Tillamook.

Nestled in the midst of the Coast Range, the area surrounding Tillamook has been designated as a state forest. Avid hikers and mountain bikers enjoy the more challenging paths, such as the Wilson River Trail, while anyone will appreciate the easily-accessible yet often overlooked beauty of Munson Creek Falls State Park. Both of these trails, as well as many others, are within half an hour of downtown Tillamook. For those who enjoy a sandier kind of trail, beautiful beaches are just fifteen minutes away from your Tillamook vacation rental in Oceanside and Netarts. Explore Tillamook's new kayaking trail with a guided tour from Kayak Tillamook. And of course, any visitor to Tillamook should spend an afternoon taking the Three Capes Scenic Drive, which offers a loop of panoramic views along the coast and a winding path through the pastoral farmland back to town.

When it comes to dining and shopping, Tillamook has more options than any town within an hour's drive. From an unexpectedly delicious roadside taco stand, to an upscale fish house, to the ubiquitous coast-town pizza place, Tillamook has a little something for everyone (including a supermarket, for stocking up on supplies for home-cooked meals in your vacation home's kitchen). Yet for these seeking a bit of solitude, the small coastal towns within a half hour of Tillamook offer plenty of laid-back charm (including Oceanside, Netarts, and Rockaway Beach, just to name a few).

Only 75 miles from Portland, a Tillamook vacation rental makes an excellent gateway to the Oregon Coast. The tourist hubs of Cannon Beach and Seaside are approximately an hour north, and the casinos and shopping at Lincoln City are an hour south. In between lies some of the most beautiful coastline in the state, ranging from wide sandy beaches to rugged cliffs and crashing waves.

And then, of course, there's the cheese.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Tygh-Valley/
The Wild West is truly wild, a landscape marked by mountains and roaring rivers...and our Tygh Valley vacation rentals offer a little slice of settler history and outdoor heaven amidst the untamed land.

Located in Wasco County, the official end of the Oregon Trail, and at the eastern base of Mount Hood, the quiet community welcomes hikers, anglers, and outdoor adventurers to its patchwork agricultural fields and river gorges. Discover the bounty and beauty worn by wagon wheels and made great by human tenacity when you visit Tygh Valley for yourself.

Settlers drank beer if they could get their hands on it, and you will too in a Tygh Valley vacation rental! Oregon's famed Rogue brewery grows everything from barley and hops to peaches and plums at its Tygh Valley farm. Stop for a farm tour from a master brewer and then hit up the tasting room for delicious suds.

The city hosts fantastic events of begotten times like the Tygh Valley Bluegrass Jamboree and The Wasco County Fair & Rodeo, or enjoy navigating narrow fairways and water hazards anytime at the Pine Hollow Golf Course. For a wider selection of dining and shopping, head just 35 minutes north to The Dalles along the Columbia Gorge.

Do as the pioneers did, explore Oregon by foot, boat, and horseback while staying in your Tygh Valley vacation rental! Book a pheasant hunting adventure with White River Outfitters, or make the adventurous hike down to the basalt falls at White River Falls State Park. WhiteWater Rafting Oregon offers canoe, kayak, and whitewater rafting trips along the rushing Deschutes River, and The Badger Creek Wilderness at Mt. Hood National Park offers 55-miles of trails traveling across fresh creeks and into alpine lakes!

Wherever you choose to explore, our Oregon vacation rentals here in Tygh Valley offer all the fun and adventure of the Wild West!

Given its proximity to Portland (12 miles south), one would be tempted to describe Tualatin (pronounced, "tu-WAHL-a-tin") as a "bedroom community," a moniker residents of this proud community would reject. Declaring war on traditional sprawl and determined to create a unique identity for itself, Tualatin began a multi-year, 300-acre redevelopment project in 1993 aimed at creating a mixed-use space, one friendly to both people and business. Today, the center of that vision has been realized in the 19 acre Tualatin Commons where visitors will find a comfortable space filled with office buildings, row houses, a hotel, work/live units called "hoffices," restaurants, and a public plaza and promenade surrounding a manmade lake. At a Portland / Willamette Valley vacation rental in Tualatin, Portland and its wealth of shopping and eateries is just 15 minutes away. Seasonal activities abound on the rugged Oregon Coast an hour and half to the west, and an hour to the east around Mt. Hood. But one needn't leave Tualatin for great shopping and dining.

Tualatin is home to a majority of Bridgeport Village, an open-air shopping area reminiscent of those found in Europe. (The smaller portion falls in the neighboring community of Tigard). It features an 18-screen movie theater, several national and regional chain restaurants, and many chain retail stores. There's even a stationary outpost of Koi Fusion, the popular Korean BBQ and Mexican food cart. Tualatin on a whole has over 50 restaurants serving every taste, from neighborhood taquerias to sushi spots to tapas and small plates at Lakeside Bistro at the Commons.

There are lots of things to do right nearby your Tualatin vacation rental. Parks, for instance, are important to the city. Serving 50 square miles, Tualatin boasts 90 parks with active recreational amenities. These include six rec centers, 162 natural areas, and eight swim centers. Skateboarders will love the new skateboard park at Tualatin Community Park. There's also a farmers market. Or, head over to the Tualatin Heritage Center and learn more about the city's history. Housed in a 1926, craftsman-style church, the building itself had its own narrow escape from the wrecking ball.

Tualatin has festivals too! If you're there in early August, its "Viva Claws Vegas," Tualatin's annual Crawfish Festival where the critter in all its culinary forms is celebrated and ingested over a two-day period with music, a parade, and contests of every sort.

So, if you're planning to be in the greater Portland area, consider a Tualatin vacation rental as your home base and avoid the traffic and hassles of the big city while still being close to Mount Hood and the beautiful Oregon coast!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Zig-Zag/
Looking for a  Mt. Hood vacation rental with a quieter, less populated pace? Consider charming ZigZag, located along the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway, right between similarly quiet Rhododendron and comparatively bustling Welches. Named for the nearby Zigzag River, it was a moniker most likely given for the means of crossing the water than for any crookedness along the banks. From your Zig Zag vacation rental, head along the river for a hike or just enjoy the great Oregon wilderness waiting outside your door! Like a lot of the towns in the Mt. Hood region, Zig Zag is surrounded by thousands of acres of mountainside national forest with hiking, biking, fishing, kayaking, and more! With the Zigzag, Sandy and Salmon Rivers close by, the area is a haven for anglers and fly-fishers. Pros and newbies alike can catch and release trout, salmon, and steelhead. For golfers, the Resort at the Mountain is right down the highway near Welches - and of course, this is ski country! Skibowl, Summit Meadows, and Timberline are all within a 30 minute drive. Spend the day flying down the slopes at the ski resort of your choice, and then return to your cozy Zig Zag cabin for hot cocoa in front of a roaring fire. Dining options in the area include the area's famous Skyway Bar and Grill, home of open mic nights, live music, Northwest BBQ, and "Frickles" - Southern fried dill pickle chips with aioli. For history buffs, the 1935 Zigzag Ranger Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and many of the buildings there were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) between 1933-1942. Newly opened in July 2013, a brand new Visitor's Center at the Ranger Station now provides visitors with information on shopping, dining, and recreation opportunities in Zig Zag and the Mt. Hood National Forest area. One of the unincorporated communities along the Mt. Hood Corridor, Zig Zag is an hour southeast of Portland. The drive from the city is short, scenic, and before you know it, you'll be at the edge of the Mt. Hood and at door of your charming Zig Zag vacation rental!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Warrenton/
Warrenton sits just between Astoria and the Pacific Ocean, on the northernmost tip of the Northern Oregon Coast. While often lumped together with her more popular neighbor to the east and referred to as the "Astoria/Warrenton" region, the town of Warrenton itself is a bit closer to the beach and the region's important historical sites, with fewer crowds.

Natural wonders surround an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Warrenton, which sits on a peninsula crowned by Fort Stevens State Park. The fort was originally constructed during the Civil War era, and now functions solely as a military museum. One of the park's must-see sites is the beached Peter Iredale shipwreck, dating from 1906.

Just to the southwest of Warrenton, Sunset Beach offers miles of uncrowded shoreline ready for beach combing, kite flying, sandcastle building, and, of course, some beautiful sunset views. On the river side of Warrenton to the east, fishing charters and guided boat tours of the Columbia are popular ways to pass the time.

For dining and entertainment, most of the livelier options are found in nearby Astoria or Seaside, but Warrenton does offer a highly regarded sports bar/pizza pub. For those who prefer to cook a meal in their vacation home, the Warrenton Deep Sea Crab & Fish Market is a hidden gem; local fishermen consider it one of the best spots to buy fresh seafood on the Oregon Coast.

A Warrenton vacation rental makes for a great home base, with some of the Northern Oregon Coast's most popular tourist destinations reached in less than an hour. The historical sites (and breweries) of Astoria are just ten minutes away; heading south, the popular Promenade at Seaside and shopping in Cannon Beach can be reached in under half an hour; and the white sands of Long Beach, WA is only thirty minutes north. Portland is just under two hours away, and Seattleites love Warrenton's three-hour proximity for weekend getaways.

Though close to shopping, dining, historic sites, and picturesque beaches, Warrenton offers a less-crowded alternative to the numerous surrounding towns.

#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Austin/
Not only is unique and unconventional Austin the state capital of Texas, but it's also a wonderful place for a fun-filled getaway in the Lone Star State! When you stay in one of Vacasa's Austin vacation rentals, you'll be well-located to enjoy music events like South by Southwest (SXSW), arts and culture, bike trails (like Portland, Austin is one of the most bike-friendly cities in the US), restaurants, and even stand-up paddle-boarding on downtown Austin's Lady Bird Lake. About 215 miles from both the cities of Galveston and Corpus Christi, Austin is right in the middle of the state, on the Colorado River, and on the edge of Texas Hill Country. It's also a college town and home to the University of Texas at Austin (Go Longhorns)! As Austin is consistently named one of the 10 fittest cities in the US, you can believe that there are a lot of outdoor activities! Lace up your jogging or hiking shoes and hit "The Trail" - the 10-mile Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail or take a slower pace and a leisurely stroll around the Cathedral of Junk, a multi-story structure made out of auto parts, bike parts, scrap metal, and more. The Barton Creek Greenbelt includes multiple nature trails, swimming holes, and for the more adventurous, rock climbing up the side of limestone cliffs. When you leave one of our Austin vacation rentals in the morning to head out for a day of fun, one thing is for sure - you'll have plenty of options! If the outdoors aren't your thing, take a tour of the Blanton Museum of Art on the University of Texas campus, browse the Yard Dog Gallery in the funky SoCo neighborhood, or after dinner at one of Austin's amazing eateries, hit a club for some live music. Find a perfect central Texas retreat from our growing collection of Austin vacation rentals. Year-round, this one-of-a-kind town with the motto, "Keep Austin Weird," offers outstanding music, art, outdoor activities, and restaurants that will keep you coming back for more!

#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Bluffton/
A Bluffton vacation rental isn't just a spot to call home during your trip to Lake Buchanan - this unique town is the perfect choice for armchair historians, gumshoes, and lovers of all things spooky!

After the completion of the Buchanan Dam in 1939, Bluffton townsfolk had been forced to move west of the original site, abandoning their homesteads, cornfields, pecan orchards, and ranches to be submerged beneath Lake Buchanan. However, in 2011, a severe drought drained the Old Bluffton site enough to reveal the remains of these ghost towns, reigniting interest and travel to this Texas locale!

There is plenty to explore in Bluffton if you've got an adventurous spirit...and perhaps a four-wheel-drive vehicle! Local tour guides offer those without proper wheels the chance to take the Vanishing Texas River Cruise, a "cruise" that once brought birdwatchers up the river but now docks on the Bluffton peninsula so that tourists can walk over low hills to the old town site.

The town center now sits just a few miles from the shoreline, but the deep waters of Lake Buchanan provide a beautiful spot for more traditional activities like fishing, boating, kayaking, and birdwatching.

Located near the more populated destinations of Wimberley and Lago Vista, Bluffton can provide a peaceful respite, whether for a long stay or just a day trip from your Texas Hill Country vacation rental!

For those interested in self-reflection and wellness, take a quick trip north from Bluffton to the Rainbow Hearth Sanctuary and Retreat on Lake Buchanan for bodywork and organic fare. Also north of Bluffton in the town of Tow is Fall Creek Vineyards, the perfect spot for wine lovers to sample a variety of delicious reds and whites (including the famous "Ed's Red" varietal).

Travelers who seek a stop that is a little rowdier and are up for a longer drive will be happy to learn that the beloved city of Austin, Texas is only 70 miles southeast of Bluffton. Austin is famous for its live music venues, delicious restaurants, and hip vintage boutiques, and plays host to the South by Southwest festival held every year for music, movies and tech.

Our Bluffton vacation rentals will be the perfect anchor on your ghost town tour of Texas. Don't forget to pack your hiking boots and love of adventure!
#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Fredericksburg/
Once considered to be only a day-trip destination, the Texas Hill Country town of Fredericksburg has developed into a full-fledged vacation destination! With noteworthy attractions and tons of recreation opportunities due to its gorgeous geography and rich history, it's a popular site in Texas. Many of our Fredericksburg vacation rentals are located in the heart of town, only a short distance from all the attractions you'll be excited to see!

History buffs will love visiting the many historic sites near our Fredericksburg vacation rentals, such as the Pioneer Museum Complex and the Sauer Beckmann Living History Farm, both of which tell the story of German settlers in Fredericksburg. Other nearby attractions include the Lyndon B. Johnson State Park and Historic Site, Lady Bird Johnson Golf Course, and Enchanted Rock State Natural Area. The town boasts of modern entertainment and dining attractions, too. Check out the famous Pedernales Brewing Company tasting room (known for its  Lobo Texas Lager), Fredericksburg Brewing Company, and Fritztown Cinema.

Depending on the time of year of your visit, you may have the chance to attend the bountiful farmers' markets selling fresh and local produce that occur from May through September. Fredericksburg "Trade Days" are held the third weekend of every month, during which townsfolk and visitors alike can haggle with local vendors and artisans over vintage wares, crafts, ranch furniture, jewelry, and even clothing.

Fredericksburg is only the beginning of the beautiful area known as Texas Hill Country. If you have a hankering for a day in the big city, head 70 miles southeast to San Antonio, which is not only the seventh most populous city in the US, but also famous for its rich history from Spanish settlement to the Alamo and River Walk (both of which you can visit)! If your tastes veer a bit more to a hip music, vintage shopping, and tequila-sampling scene, head 80 miles east to Austin the site of the annual SXSW festival and conference for music, tech, and film. On the way, stop at the little town of Dripping Springs for a relaxing break before you hit the big city!

Be sure to check out our Fredericksburg vacation rentals before planning your trip to Texas Hill Country. Whether you're a nature lover, beer expert, or amateur historian, you are sure to find your own little nook within the cozy little town of Fredericksburg, TX!

Lake Travis  Corner Unit on Top Floor at The Island

A Dripping Springs vacation rental is the perfect place to make a home while visiting Texas Hill Country. With less than 2,000 occupants, this tiny town is especially well-suited to those who desire quiet "off-the-map" locales to enjoy the beauty of nature, as well as those who desire a restful alternative close to the bustling city of Austin, TX (https://www.vacasa.com/usa/Texas/Austin/). Known for its bountiful plant and animal life, gorgeous views, babbling (or "dripping"!) creeks, and gentle hills, Dripping Springs is often called the gateway to Texas Hill Country.

Amateur astronomers and lovers of peace and quiet will love the nightly dark skies overhead at our Dripping Springs vacation rentals - this was the first town in Texas to be named an International Dark Sky Community. Use this opportunity to rent or borrow a telescope and hike atop one of the many hills to view the gorgeous stars that are only visible in the Texas sky.

The town is only 20 miles south of Pedernales Falls State Park, which is perfect for campers and hikers alike. Travelers who seek a stop that is a little rowdier will be happy to learn that the beloved city of Austin, Texas is only 25 miles west of Dripping Springs. Austin is famous for its live music venues, delicious restaurants, and hip vintage boutiques, and plays host to the South by Southwest festival held every year for music, movies, and tech.

Vacasa's Corpus Christi vacation rentals offer a comfortable home base at this coast city on the Gulf of Mexico. Come for a long weekend to enjoy the sun and water or plan a longer stay and really get to know this vibrant and charming South Texas town. There are miles of shoreline to explore, complete with windswept beaches both on the Corpus Christi Bay and on nearby islands. North Beach and McGee Beach are both popular spots in town  or head 24 miles southeast to Mustang Island State Park and the Padre Island National Seashore. Of course you can do more than just relaxing on the sand - sail, surf, kayak, or kite-board along the majestic Texas Gulf Coast.

This spot along the Gulf is just over 200 miles from both Galveston - another Gulf Coast city and Austin - home to the University of Texas. And while your vacation home has a kitchen, a Corpus Christi getaway wouldn't be complete without enjoying some of the town's famous seafood restaurants! Standouts include Snoopy's Pier, Water Street Oyster Bar and Sushi, and Catfish Charlie's.

When you head off from your Corpus Christi vacation rental you can visit the Botanical Gardens, spend the day at the Museum of Science and History, or plan a visit to the massive Texas State Aquarium for attractions like Dolphin Bay, a brand new 400,000-gallon saltwater exhibit starring Shadow and Kai, two Atlantic bottlenose dolphins.

#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Crystal-Beach/
Quiet, family-friendly, and scenic beyond belief, our selection of Crystal Beach vacation rentals may woo you into taking up Gulf Coast life permanently. Located on the beautiful Bolivar Peninsula, this beach getaway is a resort destination for any time of year.

Crystal Beach is a small beach community on the Bolivar Peninsula along the Gulf Coast of Texas, separated from Galveston Island by a three-mile channel; the free 18-minute ferry ride is a fabulous opportunity to watch ships pass by, and view marine wildlife. Crystal Beach is a particular draw for guests looking for a beach escape surrounded by the rugged beauty of the natural landscape, while still having access to urban attractions across the channel.

Guests pick Crystal Beach vacation rentals primarily for its access to the beautiful surroundings of Bolivar, including the 27 miles of beaches on which you can cruise in your car, or on your bike. The mild climate and gentle waters make it a great place to take the kids for boogie boarding, fishing, and crabbing. Swimming is leisurely, and relaxing is a snap.

Don't miss the historic Point Bolivar Lighthouse for a look at the island's history. Birdwatchers, bring your binoculars and plan a trip to the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, with over 34,000 acres of protected habitat set aside for Galveston Bay's wildlife.

Crystal Beach may have few high-rises, but it is still a resort destination with a home-grown feel. Book tee time at the Crystal Beach Community Golf Course, or visit the Fun Spot Waterslide for a little thrill!

Of course, you'll want to try some authentic Gulf Coast cuisine, offering fresh seafood and scrumptious barbecue. Try Steve's Landing Restaurant, or Stingaree Restaurant & Bar. Grab lunch to go at the Smoking Pig food cart, or make a picnic in your own Crystal Beach lodging, then take it to the Fort Travis Seashore Park for an afternoon by the Gulf.

Our Crystal Beach rentals offer Gulf Coast travelers a different Texas experience: one of robust, natural beauty, quiet stretches of street, and miles of sand and water.
#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Galveston/
This Texas city's motto is, "It's island time," and when you stay in one of our Galveston vacation rentals, you'll be able to see why! Galveston Island is parallel to the Texas coast, deep in the heart of south Texas. You'll be about 50 miles from bustling Houston, TX and surrounded by gorgeous Galveston Bay to the north and the equally scenic Gulf of Mexico to the south. Like Corpus Christi just over 200 miles southwest, Galveston boasts beautiful beaches, a variety of cultural attractions, and fresh, delicious seafood! Visit in September for the Galveston Island Wild Texas Shrimp Festival for gumbos and other popular shrimp dishes. Year-round you can also plan a dinner out at Olympia the Grill at Pier 21 or head to Little Daddy's Gumbo Bar for a memorable seafood meal. Galveston's Grand 1894 Opera House is a sure bet for entertainment and cultural events in town, with everything from concerts, theater, ballet, to yes, even opera. Every six to eight weeks, there's an Art Walk planned in the historic downtown district, Galveston has one of the largest concentrations of Victorian architecture in the US, and the city is also home to a thriving art gallery scene. When you step outside your Galveston getaway, you'll have things to do from sunrise to sunset! Like Austin, Galveston is an outdoor enthusiast's haven! Here you'll find hiking and biking trails, birding opportunities, and even gorgeous Gulf beaches (32 miles of beaches to be precise). The seawall along the Gulf of Mexico has almost 10 and a half miles of continuous sidewalk for walkers, joggers, bikers, and sightseers. There's great boating in Galveston Bay - at Offatts Bayou, a lovely estuary, you can take a scenic cruise on a paddlewheel boat or spend an afternoon watching for loons. Of course, fishing in the Gulf is not to be missed, (you will, of course, need to purchase a Texas fishing license). Drop your line off the seawall, head out on the bay, or even get out further from the coast for offshore fishing - you might catch kingfish, snapper, and even tuna. When you're looking for comfortable and conveniently-located Galveston vacation rentals, look no further than Vacasa! Plan a Texas Gulf Coast getaway to sunny, laid-back Galveston and discover the benefits of "Island Time."
#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Jamaica-Beach/

Our Jamaica Beach rentals offer glorious views of the West Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, plus quick beach access, and a neighborhood feel that is both welcoming and serene. Vacasa is excited to offer Texas vacation rentals here in Jamaica Beach!

Located 15 miles from Galveston, and an hour and a half away from Houston, this small town in the middle of the island is the perfect distance from the hustle and bustle, and offers island-goers more of a locals' experience than they might find at some of the nearby resorts.

Guests of our Jamaica Beach rentals get full access to the water on all sides: the Regatta Basin Public Boat Ramp leads guest out to the West Bay, and Jamaica Beach's public stretch of sand is wonderfully family-friendly. Visit Galveston Island State Park for hiking, bird watching, unsupervised swimming, and camping.

#Pathname:/usa/Texas/North-Padre-Island/
When you think about staying in one of our Texas vacation rentals, a relaxing coastal retreat probably isn't the first thing you imagine! For those who are new to the Lone Star State, our beautiful North Padre Island vacation rentals are a well-kept secret. Boasting one of the longest undeveloped coastlines in the area and a laid-back vibe, this Gulf Coast town has everything you need for a memorable vacation!

North Padre Island is located near Mustang Island, 30 miles down-island from Port Aransas and 33 miles from Corpus Christi. Nestled between protected wetlands, pretty sand dunes, and a long stretch of shoreline, our North Padre Island vacation rentals are a true respite from the real world!

The highlight of North Padre Island is the Padre Island National Seashore, which protects 70 miles of pristine coastline. This landscape is home to around 380 species of birds, as well as a variety of wildlife that includes ghost crabs, coyotes, and deer.

Padre Island National Seashore offers ranger-guided activities and lectures and a paved nature trail that's perfect for every age and mobility. There are fishing spots for everything from cat fish to shark (please note that proper licensing is required), so make sure to pack your tackle. The park hosts a sea turtle hatching program during the summer and guests are invited to witness the release of thousands of little baby turtles into the ocean!

North Padre Island sits with the Gulf of Mexico on one side, accessible by the Packery Channel, and the quiet waters of Laguna Madre on the other.

#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/Burlington/
Northern Vermont is world-renowned for its verdant hills, quaint towns and pristine lakes—and our Burlington vacation rentals, located in the state's largest city, make the perfect home base for your next getaway.

The town has the luxury of also being the state's cultural capital, with myriad theaters, museums, and concert halls at which to while away the day sightseeing. An important trading center in the 1800s, Burlington remains a city with a bustling harbor amid stately Victorian homes. It's often called the "Prettiest City in America," and is a popular place to retire due to its great infrastructure and quality of life. Come explore this charming city less than an hour from the Canadian border and lay your head at one of our ?Burlington vacation rentals!

As the largest city in Vermont, Burlington boasts the most attractions, from modern cultural institutions to historic homes and lighthouses.

The Robert Hull Fleming Museum sits on the University of Vermont campus, and boasts contemporary and historic art for all ages.

The Burlington Breakwater Lights draw tourists due to their position standing guard over the town; the actual lighthouses are replicas of the originals, but the breakwater itself is on the National Register of Historic Places. Like other towns in the region, Burlington has a plethora of parks and recreation areas that are kept in pristine condition. Oakledge Park boasts a rocky beach but is swimmable; Red Rocks Park is a favorite in winter for snowshoeing and cross country skiing, and North Beach Campground draws leaf peepers from all over New England due to its scenic trails and gorgeous vistas.

As the gateway to the Lake Champlain region and Quebec, Burlington is a great base from which to take day trips. Several of Lake Champlain's charming towns are all within easy driving distance. North Hero and South Hero boast clean and calm beaches and abundant green spaces. Grand Isle is a town that's almost frozen in time, with quaint homesteads and a slower pace. The ski mecca of Killington is less than two hours away, and is worth a winter visit for the world-class powder alone. Montreal is only 45 miles away, and boasts even more cultural and dining sites than you'll find in Burlington...so bring your passport!

Burlington is famous as one of the country's most livable cities, and there's no better way to experience it than by living like a local in your own private Burlington vacation rental!

This mosaic of landscapes creates a vacation setting unlike any other, with its red dirt, towering rock formations, and high desert vegetation.

About 140 or so miles north is the Wasatch Mountain Range of Park City, and just 83 miles north is the mountain resort of Brian Head.

One word perfectly describes St. George: active. This is a dynamic location, bringing guests close to some of the most astounding natural surroundings, yet supplying urban musts with a rich arts and culture scene.

Guests of our St. George vacation rentals will find themselves outside most of the time, enjoying the well-maintained trails and paths within many of the parks. Biking, hiking, trail riding, rock climbing, camping, and backpacking are all favorite pastimes (proper permits and passes may be required).

The crown jewel of the St. George area is about 40 miles northeast at Zion National Park. From the Narrows, a stretch of canyons and streams traversing through the park to Angel's Landing, a hike up steep cliffs to get to a panoramic view of Zion Canyon, Zion offers guests of all active levels a chance to take in its majesty.

Red Cliffs Desert Reserve is only eight miles from town proper. Boasting open spaces and fabulous views, this reserve is a paradise for unique desert wildlife like the desert tortoise and the Gila monster.

Bryce Canyon National Park, about 140 miles away from St. George, is a truly unique landscape and definitely worth the drive. Even locals struggle to adequately describe the amazingly vibrant combination of orange and pink hoodoos (tall spires of rock), and high desert scrub forests. Perfect for both hikers and photographers, this is a park you have to see to believe.

Our St. George vacation rentals are also fabulous options for athletes visiting the area for the St. George Marathon, which is the fifth-largest marathon in the US, or the IRONMAN 70.3 US Pro Series.

Need a break from the rough and tumble of the outdoors? Shop around Ancestor Square and enjoy a selection from over 100 eateries in the historic downtown area. Schedule tee times at golf courses like Sunbrook and St. George Golf Club or Coral Canyon Golf, or take the kids to the Washington City Community Center for a dip in the pool. On a hot day, stop by a local joint called Swig, a drive-thru specifically for cold drinks!

Arts and culture enthusiasts will adore the options available to them, from galleries like the DeZion Gallery exhibiting local artists to the Tuacahn Amphitheatre for Broadway shows and concerts surrounded by the astounding red rocks. Museums of all sorts dot the area, including a Children's Museum and the St. George Temple and Tabernacle. Learn about Utah's origins at the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers Museum, or about some of the Utah's oldest locals at the Dinosaur Discovery Site.

During your stay, you may catch a free concert at the Concerts in the Park series, indulge in a stroll through the annual Art Festival, or participate in an Art Walk.

Whether you're sweaty from bike riding, dusty from hiking, or have arms full of shopping bags from downtown, our St. George vacation rentals welcome you back with warm interiors, beautiful views, and anticipation for the next day of adventure.
#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/Isle-La-Motte/
Floating calmly amongst the waters of the vast and regal Lake Champlain, the shores of Isle La Motte, the northernmost link in the chain of the Lake Champlain Islands, offers a peaceful respite for nature-lovers and those looking to trade TV screens and cell phones for sunrises and scenic views. Though remote, Isle La Motte hosts an extensive and easily accessibly shoreline - a kayaker's dream - and endless black marble nooks and crannies begging to be explored. A trip to Isle La Motte and a stay in one of our Isle La Motte vacation rentals epitomizes the meaning of a peaceful getaway.

The real treasure of Isle La Motte lies in its foundation, which is made of an alluring dark limestone called black marble. The Fisk Quarry Nature Preserve offers visitors a glimpse of the island's history as a mining town. Though much of the quarry is overgrown and bursting with lush flora and fauna, one need not be a geologist to appreciate the natural beauty of the mighty marble facades, which are speckled with exposed fossils. Amateur archaeologists and curious hikers welcome.

The Goodsell Ridge Preserve contains 480 millions years of fossilized history from the Chazy Fossil Reef amongst its 85 sprawling acres of old farm fields. Venture on a self guided tour of the fossils for a fascinating recap on evolution that would make your fifth grade science teacher proud, or traverse through the flora of the trails for your daily dose of natural wonder.

Kayakers, bikers, and hikers will find no shortage of outdoor adventure with their preferred mode of active transport. Reinvigorate a tired body or an overworked mind with a brisk paddle along the coast, bike around the perimeter, or hike through the quarry and find your sanctuary in the lake breeze and lush trails of this island destination.

A trek, bike, or drive to the northern point of the island will allow visitors a glimpse of the charming Isle La Motte Light, an iron lighthouse first used in 1857, and which still functions today on solar power. Tranquility awaits in the spiritual atmosphere at St. Anne's Shrine, where peaceful self reflection meets zen bending on the shores of Sandy Point.

An island retreat at our Isle La Motte vacation rentals offers an array of opportunities to unwind in seclusion as well as chances to venture outside of the black marble bluffs. Because the Lake Champlain Islands are nestled between Montreal and Burlington, both destinations are accessible from Isle La Motte, which is about sixty miles south of the former and forty-five miles north of the latter. It is also about 18 miles from Grand Isle, one of its sister islands, where visitors will find Grand Isle State Park for further opportunities to soak in the majesty of the great New England outdoors.

Golden under crisp foliage in the fall and buzzing with outdoor activity in the summer, Isle La Motte beckons visitors with humbling natural beauty along the shores of the stunning Lake Champlain. A trip to the island and a stay in one of our Isle La Motte vacation rentals is perfect for those looking to unwind and replenish with a little lake effect serenity. Book your bliss today!

#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/South-Hero/
One of four towns on the Lake Champlain Islands, South Hero, Vermont, earns a unique place among them. Lush forests give way to mountain streams and rocky shores, evoking a more peaceful time. The beach is a lovely place to enjoy a quiet summer's day and myriad hiking and biking trails abound. You'll probably not see another soul on your daily excursions—it's no wonder our South Hero, VT vacation rentals are a hit with visitors!

Founded by hundreds of Revolutionary War veterans to honor Ethan and Ira Allen, South Hero was originally part of the single town of Two Heroes, but was reconfigured in 1798. The town has long sustained an all-American feel, with quaint mom-and-pop shops, a school that is also its community center, and miles of verdant, organic farmland. Apples are the main crop, and you'll find orchards throughout the town's charming environs. With only three bridges connecting the four Lake Champlain Island towns to the rest of the state, visitors experience a true getting-away-from-it-all vibe. Choosing the comfort and privacy of our Vermont vacation rentals in South Hero will definitely boost that feeling!

South Hero has a small year-round population, and visitors head here to truly escape, so the town doesn't boast dozens of historic sites like other Vermont cities. Still, there's plenty to see. Nothing beats White's Beach on a hot summer day. Situated on West Shore Road, the beach features a volleyball court as well as a swimming section, but non-swimmers will love the views of the Adirondacks and the southern portion of Lake Champlain. Bird House Forest is just moments away from Whites Beach, boasting a plethora of brilliantly colored birdhouses hanging from hardwood trees. (It's a swampy area, so make sure to wear your wellies when you venture forth!)

Nearby Castle Island is on everyone's must-see list, due to the miniature castles built by Harry Barber in the early 20th century dotting the landscape. Most are in good condition and feature full turrets and battlements. Snow Farm Winery and Vineyard is Vermont's first winery. Since 1992, the Lane family has been crafting choice Pinot Noir and Riesling as well as stellar ice wine. Head here for summer concerts on the lawn.

When you stay at a South Hero vacation rental, the entire Lake Champlain Islands region is at your fingertips, boasting 200 miles of gorgeous coastline. Head to North Hero for the North Hero State Park and the historic North Hero House. Grand Isle appeals to hikers and bikers, thanks to Grand Isle State Park. Samuel Champlain's first sight of the new world was of Isle La Motte; today, it's famous for St. Anne's Shrine and fossils galore! Who knows? You might even spy the ever-elusive Champ, the mythic monster said to reside in the lake.

Don't want to get away from quite everything? Burlington is just 20 minutes from South Hero, so you can hit a play or eat at one of the city's many farm-to-table restaurants.

Whether it's biking or boating or just loafing, our South Hero vacation rentals will make your stay in this gorgeous region a getaway to remember!
#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/West-Dover/
The best things to do in the scenic state of Vermont require a mountain and plenty of powder, and one in search of these conditions need not look further than our West Dover vacation rentals!

Home of the beautiful Mount Snow, each year, winter sports enthusiasts flock to West Dover to enjoy what is arguably the Northeast's most entertaining and abundant natural resource - snow! Whether you're a snow bunny or a seasoned shredder yourself, or are just looking to enjoy the charm of smalltown New England from a cozy home away from home, a stay in one of our ?Vermont vacation rentals is sure to satisfy.

As previously mentioned, West Dover's greatest attraction is Mount Snow?. With a summit elevation of 3,600 feet, 588 total skiable acres, and four main mountain areas, including 100 acres of ten terrain parks (for those looking to add to their repertoire of tricks on the super-pipe), it's easy to spend countless hours shredding the snowy slopes. The mountain is also host to a series of winter sports events and competitions, making it a mecca for aspiring pros - and casual boarders looking to learn from the best.

If you're having trouble finding balance on a board, or are simply along for the ride, perhaps a massage, facial, or herbal wrap at Mount Snow's holistic ?Naturespa? will provide the rejuvenation you need to nail tomorrow's first run. The spa offers seasonal specialties,so sore muscles, tense shoulders, or tired minds can find relief at the hands of experienced masseuses any time of the year. Even if you don't have time to hit the spa, a no-stress stay in one of our ?West Dover vacation rentals will ensure comfort and relaxation so you can focus on enjoying your New England getaway.

The fun at Mount Snow isn't limited to the winter months. The summer season is just as jam-packed with alpine activities as its chilly counterpart. When snow-covered trails shed their wooly white blankets, mountain bikers hit the lifts to explore the slopes on wheels in the ?Mount Snow Bike Park?. Those looking for a little adventure can let gravity take the wheel (literally) and try a few runs on Trail 7, dubbed the largest introductory trail in the East.

Adrenaline junkies and leisure lovers unite on the links at the ?Mount Snow Golf Club?, but that isn't to say a round or two on this course won't get your heart pumping. Nestled in the Green Mountains and boasting radiant emerald fairways, a round in the mountains poses a unique challenge to both casual and serious golfers.

If you're looking to get off of the mountain for a bit, Wilmington, VT. is only about eight miles from West Dover and offers family fun at the Zora Adventure Center and aquatic adventures with High Country Marine on Lake Whitingham. Approximately 70 miles northeast await the snow-capped peaks and trails of Killington. West Dover and Mount Snow are known for being exceptionally accessible, and are only about 150 miles from ?Boston and 100 miles from Hartford.

When the flakes fly this winter, you'll want to be one of two places - flying down the slopes of Mount Snow or cozy and comfortable in one of our accommodating ?West Dover vacation homes?!
#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/Woodstock/
Picture the ideal New England landscape. There are rolling hills, cloaked in the golds and ruby reds of changing foliage or blanketed with thick coats of undisturbed snow, and dotted with the occasional idyllic red farmhouse - the stuff of an N.C. Wyeth painting. Nestled in a sleepy valley, the downtown area is quaint and placid, characterized by red brick buildings and patches of cobblestone in the streets where people mill about (with a purpose, of course - this is New England after all!). Here, the street lamps glow warmer and brighter, the air feels crisper, and the night sky, unpolluted by artificial light, boasts more celestial freckles than seemingly possible. Luckily, the rustic charm and holiday-card imagery of this scene is no fantasy and the lovely reality of Woodstock, Vermont is even better than what you imagined! Book one of our cozy Woodstock vacation rentals today to see for yourself why everyone is talking about beautiful New England.

New England prides itself on its maple syrup and a visit to Woodstock certainly warrants a taste of the stuff right from the source! Tour the sugar house at Sugarbush Farm in the fall and see how maple syrup is made while savoring samples of nature's nectar. Work up an appetite and meet the farmers and animals as you walk around the grounds. Tease your tastebuds by transitioning from sweet to savory when you try one (or two or ten!) of the fourteen varieties of homemade cheeses. The farm, a microcosm of the tastes and sights of classic New England, scintillates in golds and red in the fiery glory of autumn and is irresistible for leaf peepers and amateur photographers alike!

A visit to the Billings Farm and Museum is essential to a well-rounded Woodstock experience. Take a trip in time through traditional Vermont culture and history, tour the working dairy farm, marvel at the changes in farm technology, and develop an appreciation for the way family farms operated in the late 1800's! The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Park charms visitors with its emerald beauty, ancient hemlocks, and placid pastures of the Green Mountains. Guests of all ages will be captivated by the intriguing anecdotes, movies, and facts about the Marsh, Billings, and Rockefeller families and their respective historical roles in the area. Round out your Green Mountain history lesson with a visit to the Woodstock History Center or attend one of their sponsored classes or events, ranging from old-timey musical acts to stonewall building classes to ice cream socials. Spend an afternoon experiencing the essence of Woodstock with a perusal through its quaint downtown area.

When it comes to winter weather, New England does it best and Woodstock certainly makes snow days fun! The well-maintained, family friendly trails of Woodstock's Suicide Six resort hosted the first National "Snow Surfing" (more commonly known today as snowboarding) competition in 1982 and has been providing downhill thrills to skiers and snowboarders of all ages and abilities ever since! The mountain boasts 24 trails (30% of which are rated as beginner, 40% as intermediate, and 30% as advanced), cozy outdoor fireplaces, and an inviting lodge for ski groupies to hang with snow bunny friends between runs. It's a great place to share your passion for skiing and snowboarding with your kids and friends before retiring for hot chocolate by the fire for a quintessential New England winter evening in one of our Woodstock vacation homes!

With its authentic red wooden bridges and picturesque views, the Ottauquechee River is wondrous and pristine in the ice and snow of winter and lush and glittering in the spring and summer. A stroll along the riverbank and across the rustic bridges will evoke pastoral reverberations of that Robert Frost poem you memorized for seventh grade English. Kayak the placid waters or appreciate the natural beauty through the lens of your camera and let the panacean effects of the pure New England air melt away your worries and woes!

If you're in the market for breathtaking views at a higher elevation, plan a sunrise hike up Mt. Tom for a bird's eye perspective of Woodstock.

Woodstock is only about 19 miles from even more skiing and fantastic powder action in Killington and 77 miles from the slopes of Mount Snow in West Dover. Eclectic boutiques and exquisite dining await in the groovy town of Burlington, about 90 miles northwest on the majestic Lake Champlain.

Perhaps you've been longing to escape to the clean mountain air on snowy ski slopes or maybe you've been pining for the incomparably picturesque beauty of a quintessential New England landscape ablaze in the captivating colors of the fall foliage. Whatever it is that you're looking for, you'll find exactly what you need during your stay in a beautiful New England vacation rental.

When two roads converge in a yellow wood, take the one that leads you to cozy comfort with traditional, small-town Vermont flair in one of our lovely Woodstock vacation rentals - even if its not necessarily the one less traveled, we're sure Robert Frost wouldn't mind!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Anacortes/
Pronounced "Anna-Cortis," Anacortes, Washington is named for Anna Curtis, the wife of early Fidalgo Island settler, Amos Bowman. Poised half-way between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. - with Fidalgo Bay to the east and the waters of Puget Sound to the west - Anacortes is perfectly placed for its role as homeport to the four islands of the San Juan Archipelago: Lopez, Shaw, Orcas, and San Juan. Unlike the islands it serves, Fidalgo Island is anchored to the Washington mainland and can be reached by car. Travelers not accessing the islands by air via the Orcas Island or Lopez Island airports will board the Washington State Ferry at Anacortes and make their way to the islands by ship, a not so regrettable fate once one is afloat and experiencing, up close, the awesome beauty of Puget Sound. In its long history, Anacortes has evolved from a home for native Indians, to early Spanish explorers, trading and trapping, farming, fishing, and lumber to its present role as a tourist hub and gateway to the magnificent San Juan Islands. Like footprints, the tangible evidence of that evolution can be seen in the many historic buildings that make up Anacortes' "Old Town." Visitors can stroll among a variety of antique shops and galleries where everything from paintings, sculpture, jewelry, glass-work, photography and mixed media can be found. There's also the Anacortes Museum and Maritime Heritage Center where you'll find vintage photos and art work in its Carnegie Gallery. When you're hungry, sample one of 50 eateries in Anacortes serving everything from deli-sandwiches to Mediterranean and Mexican fare. If you're in the city in August, check out the Anacortes Arts Festival. In October, there's "Bier on the Pier," Anacortes' version of Oktoberfest. Though most of Anacortes hugs the waters of Puget Sound in the north and wraps eastward along Fidalgo Bay, much of Fidalgo Island is undeveloped. Certainly, there's no lack of things to do out on or near the water. You can take a whale-watching tour, go kayaking, sailing, boating, and crabbing. But south of bustling Anacortes are vast stretches of green with parks and lakes where bikers and birders, hikers and wildlife watchers, can see everything from eagles, to deer, otters to raccoons, and beaver to coyote. Climb Mount Erie and get an eagle's-eye view of the surrounding area. Whether charming and picturesque Anacortes is, for you, just a jumping off point to the San Juans, or a destination in-itself, take a little time to savor the history and beauty of this little city nestled by the waters of Puget Sound.

Just across from the Long Beach Peninsula, a Bay Center vacation rental offers a small-town environment with gorgeous Willapa Bay views! And for seafood lovers, the bay is home to many oyster farms because of the shallow estuary environment, just perfect for this type of marine life. Not just for oysters and clams, the Willapa Bay is a scenic and peaceful Washington destination for getaways right near ocean beaches and the towns of Seaview and Long Beach, just across the bay and to the southwest. Sightsee along the waterfront, buy Dungeness crab, salmon, and Pacific oysters at local canneries, boat along the bay and beautiful water trails, or just relax at your lovely Bay Center vacation rental.

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/camano-island/
It's "the island you can drive to!" Camano Island hangs off the edge of the Washington mainland 55 miles north of Seattle like a giant, green parenthesis. Unlike the more developed San Juan Islands to the north, you won't have to wait for a ferry here. Yet, despite Camano Island's accessibility, it's generally unspoiled. Surrounded by Saratoga Passage to the west, Skagit Bay to the north, and Port Susan to the east, the island is naturally isolated and is protected even further by two State Parks within its boundaries. Little wonder, then, that loyal visitors to Camano Island swell the population each summer to enjoy a pristine island environment free of glitzy tourist traps. Carpeted with majestic evergreen forests and rimmed by 56 miles of pristine beaches, Camano Island is 39.7 square miles of unadulterated Pacific Northwest beauty and abundance. Your first stop, as you enter Camano Island, should be the Camano Gateway: the center where you'll find lots of useful info about parks, recreational activities, and local businesses. Boaters will find launch sites at Utsalady Bay and Cavalero Beach. Head over to Cama Beach State Park where you'll find a restored 1930's fishing resort. And speaking of fishing, Camano Island is unparalleled! Camano Island has fishing available during every season: from salmon in the winter, spring & summer; to lingcod, Dolly Varden trout & cutthroat in May/June; to year-round flounder and bottomfish. Iverson Beach is one of the few places in Washington State where you can fish for sturgeon year-round from shore! (Hikers: There's also a great trail that winds through the preserve). Or, check out Camano Island State Park, whose 134 acres is filled with mountain vistas and miles of beach perfect for shellfish harvesting. The east side of Camano offers stellar views of Mt. Baker, Mt. Rainier, the Cascade Mountains and quiet Port Susan. Camano Island isn't all wilderness, however. There are a few restaurants, grocery stores, galleries and shops. And there are events, among which are the Port Susan Snow Goose & Birding Festival (February), The Spring Art Show (June), Art by the Bay and The Stanwood-Camano Festival of Art and Music (July), The Harvest Jubilee (September), and The Stanwood-Camano Chili & Chowder Cook-off (November). No matter when you come to Camano Island, you'll discover an environment filled with astounding beauty, one refreshingly unscathed by human hands.

The region produces dry crops like wheat, which welcome visitors with sweet breezes and golden rolling fields. The lyrics to  “America the Beautiful” come to mind when envisioning the views from Goldendale vacation rentals:

For purple mountain majesties

Above the fruited plain!"

The Little Klickitat River runs through the heart of the town and is a popular spot for family inner tube floats, birdwatchers, and fishermen alike. Bloodgood Creek is an especially popular place to hook a rainbow trout and the Columbia River is just 13 miles south, where you can wind surf, raft, and kayak!

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Klickitat/
With sunshine most of the year and natural beauty for miles, the town of Klickitat, Washington, may be small, but it's a big draw for fishermen, hikers, rafters, paddlers, and all kinds of outdoor adventurers and nature enthusiasts. Staying in one of our Klickitat vacation rentals is a great way to experience the beautiful, glacier-fed Klickitat River, a nationally designated Wild and Scenic place, and the surrounding canyons and hill country. Vacation rentals are a particularly convenient option for fly fisherman and steelhead seekers looking for Klickitat lodging during the peak river seasons.

If steelheading, fly fishing or float fishing is your thing, Klickitat is the place for you. It's one of the top fishing destinations in the Columbia River Gorge. At the end of a fun day on the river, return to your Klickitat vacation rental and grill up your fresh trout, salmon or steelhead for dinner.

The Klickitat River, which ends at the Columbia River Gorge at Lyle, just east of White Salmon, is a popular destination for rafting, kayaking and canoeing. Hikers and mountain bikers love the Klickitat Trail, a 31-mile path that meanders along the Klickitat River, following an old railroad bed through wild, scenic territory dotted with wildflowers in season, and the nearby reaches of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, including the foothills of Mt. Adams, which looms regally over the Klickitat River Valley. Klickitat is also a popular destination for birding: an abandoned dry ice factory outside of town is an annual roosting place for hundreds of Vaux's swifts, which put on a stunning air show when they return to the chimney each night.

The tiny, scenic canyon town of Klickitat celebrates its heritage each June at the annual Klickitat Canyon Days festival, when the whole community comes out to toast its 100-plus years of history. Year-round, shops like the Canyon Market, and Klickitat Trader, serve as community gathering places... and a convenient place to pick up fishing supplies, sandwiches, groceries, passes and permits, or to leave your truck and trailer for the fishing shuttle service, which means you can fish your way down the river and have your vehicle waiting for you where you pull out! With so much natural beauty and all types of river adventures, Klickitat is a winning destination for Columbia Gorge vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Leavenworth/
If you want to visit somewhere with plenty of old-world charm and fun activities, look no further than beautiful Leavenworth! A lovely Bavarian style permeates the entire village, so a stay in one of our Leavenworth lodging options promises easy access to the unique businesses of this town while still being within easy reach of all the fantastic attractions near our other Washington vacation rentals.

Here in Central Washington you will enjoy gorgeous scenery in every direction, ranging from snow-capped mountain peaks to raging rivers to green valleys and more! To get to your Leavenworth lodging from Seattle simply take a scenic two-hour drive east. Along the way you will drive over Stevens Pass, breathe in pine-scented fresh mountain air, and hear the sounds of the Wenatchee River rapids flowing downhill. If you're coming into Leavenworth from Spokane or other cities to the east, you will drive by hills, valleys, and fruit orchards on your way into town. In fact, this area is a fantastic place for agritourism, and nearby Wenatchee, just 30 minutes down the road, is famous for its apple, cherry, and pear orchards. Nature's bounty is on full display in this part of the state, and when you stay in one of our Leavenworth cabins you will be close to all the farms, breweries, and wineries - as well as all the other cities and attractions - in this wonderful area.

In Leavenworth itself, you will find an endearing and lovely city. Visitors immediately notice that all the buildings (even certain well-known fast food restaurants and grocery stores) are fully decked out in Bavarian-style architecture. Speakers broadcast faint polka music near the main street, and many of the businesses have fun German themes. Souvenir shops sell everything from authentic nutcrackers to music boxes and other gifts, and there are ample fantastic restaurants. Spend an afternoon sampling the bratwurst, pretzels, and fondue, washed down with a refreshing pint. Of course, if you're in the mood for something a little different, you can easily order pizza, burgers, or even crepes, then try some wine tastings from local wineries.

This is truly a special town that will keep you coming back for more! If you're staying in one of our Leavenworth cabins during the warmer months you will want to check out the wonderful Waterfront Park, where you can enjoy nature walks, birdwatching, and even fishing and rafting on the Wenatchee River. In the colder months skiiers and snowboarders flock to this region's many mountains, and Leavenworth is blanketed with a layer of snow that makes the town feel even more festive. There are many events held throughout the year, including a fun tree-lighting ceremony around the holidays, an accordion celebration, the wonderful Maifest in May, and of course the most popular, the famous Leavenworth Oktoberfest celebration!

Whether you're touring nearby breweries and wineries, perusing the Nutcracker Museum, taking a wintery sleigh ride at Eagle Creek Ranch, or leisurely exploring this charming town, you will have a smile on your face throughout your visit. With so many wonderful indoor and outdoor attractions nearby, every visitor will soon find their favorite.

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Long-Beach/
The Long Beach Peninsula stretches for 28 miles, with beautiful sandy shores on the Pacific side and the wildlife-rich Willapa Bay on the other. At the base of the peninsula sits the charming town of Long Beach, Washington State's most popular beach town and a favorite getaway of Seattleites and Portlanders alike. With a boardwalk, a walkable downtown, and naturally stunning surroundings, a stay in a Long Beach, Washington vacation rental makes for an idyllic Pacific Northwest coastal experience.

Within thirty minutes of town sit a number of splendid state parks, recreation areas, and a national wildlife refuge. Among them is Cape Disappointment State Park, one of Washington's most popular destinations and home to the Northwest's oldest lighthouse, jaw-dropping views of the mouth of the Columbia River, and some truly excellent fishing. To the north, Leadbetter Point State Park has some of the region's best birdwatching along the northern shore of Willapa Bay, plus several miles of hiking trails and opportunities for crabbing and fishing.

Although a small town, visitors can eat very well in Long Beach. The Aloha Charlie Fish Company offers perhaps the best clam chowder and pan-fried oysters in town, but they have plenty of healthy competition! A few minutes outside of downtown Long Beach, The Depot in Seaview and Pelicano Restaurant in Iwalco offer more upscale dining. For rainy-day entertainment, it's hard to beat the iconically kitschy Marsh's Free Museum (home of Jake the Alligator Man), but the Long Beach Peninsula is also home to a kite museum and a cranberry museum, dedicated to the region's productive cranberry bogs.

Long Beach is just over three hours from Seattle and two from Portland, making it a convenient destination from either city. Although technically in Washington, it's easy to explore the best of the Northern Oregon Coast from Long Beach; historic Astoria is only half an hour away, and popular tourist destinations at Seaside and Cannon Beach can be reached within an hour. For a Pacific Northwest beach town equally rich in natural beauty, outdoor recreation, and dining & entertainment options, Long Beach can't be beat.
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Lopez-Island/
Lopez Island lies about 80 miles north of Seattle and is the first stop in the 45 minute ferry ride beginning in Anacortes, Washington on the U.S. mainland. Lopez Island is a great pick for an off the beaten path San Juans / Puget Sound vacation rental, as you will find there's always something to do in this unique part of the globe - even if it's just relaxing on the back porch of your beach house! The island is 15 miles long, eight miles wide, and is mostly rolling hills and flat pastureland, surrounded by sparkling blue waters. It's the third largest island in the San Juan Islands chain. If you're lucky enough to arrive in your own boat, you'll have your choice of marinas in Fisherman Bay, at Spencer Spit State Park, and Odlin County Park. An outdoor enthusiast? You'll be right at home here! For cyclists, Lopez Island is a dream-come-true! The truly ambitious can take the 30-mile loop around the island that will take you, among other places, through Spencer Spit Park, Odlin Park, and MacKaye Harbor. Hikers will relish the 45 acres of day trails in Shark Reef Sanctuary, with trails through old growth woods and along scenic coastal vistas. Along the way, don't be surprised if you see deer, foxes, eagles, harbor seals, river otters, and endangered orca whales! There are lots of public beaches and trails that lead to the waterfront. Much of Lopez Island's natural beauty is protected in parks like Agate Beach, Shark Reef Park, and Upright Head. The commercial and cultural center of the island is Lopez Village where you'll find shops, restaurants, cafes, and galleries along the bay. Have lunch at the picnic area near Lopez Village Park. Choose from six eateries on the island. There are weekend farmers' markets and artisan events. Two events stand out in the island's calendar: In April thereÃ¢â?¬â?¢s the bike tour around the island, and beginning after Thanksgiving, the Winter Village is a holiday celebration including an array of lights and decorations. Like its neighbor Orcas Island to the north, Lopez Island is sandwiched between Vancouver, B.C. to the west, Washington State to the east, the Strait of Georgia to the north, and the Strait of San Juan de Fuca to the south. And although the journey here will include a plane ride or a trip on a Washington State Ferry, once you arrive at your relaxing Lopez Island vacation rental, you will be rewarded greatly for your extra effort!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Manson/
Our growing selection of Manson vacation rentals are in the heart of Washington's newest wine country: the Lake Chelan Valley! The gorgeous valley offers something for everyone. From stand-up paddleboarding on Washington's largest natural lake to winery tours in the scenic hillsides, there's never a lull along Lake Chelan...unless you choose to spend the day simply relaxing by the lake.

Our Manson vacation rentals are located in the picturesque community known as "The Village By the Bay" on the shores of Lake Chelan. The lake itself is a breathtaking deep water lake that flows more than 50 miles from the Cascade mountains down into the Columbia River. The rural community of Manson is just on the outskirts of the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, and sits seven miles west of the town of Chelan and Highway 97.

With its peaceful atmosphere and fantastic location right on the water, Manson is an ideal destination for Lake Chelan vacation rentals. The lake and surrounding mountains are ideal for biking, hiking, and of course fishing!

Launch your boat at Old Mill Park or fish for Kokanee off the docks at the Manson Bay Marina. The community is also home to four other lakes, like Wapato Lake, which make for perfect fishing holes or lazy days in an inner tube!

If you want a break from the water, ride your bike along The Manson Loop, which starts downtown and travels through orchards and along the lake. Golfers can tee off nearby at the Lake Chelan Golf Course. In winter, the region boasts snowmobile trails, Nordic skiing, and alpine runs along the Echo Valley Ski Area, just six miles east of town.

All those outdoor adventures will work up your appetite...and our Manson vacation rentals are surrounded by vineyards and foodie delights. Sample rieslings at Hard Row to Hoe vineyards or wander the Mediterranean-inspired Benson Vineyards Estate Winery. Order filet mignon at Wapto Point Cellars, or go low-key with "Man Candy" (deep fried bacon) at the Sunset Bar & Grill.

Whether you've come for the thrill of outdoor adventure or ultimate relaxation, Manson is an idyllic lakeside community that offers the best of both worlds. Plan your next getaway today!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Lyle/
A getaway to one of our beautiful Lyle, Washington vacation rentals may bring an unexpected perk: this historic town's unique location on the north side of the Columbia River Gorge brings with it over 300 days of sunshine a year! Lyle sits further east than other Washington-side destinations like Washougal and Stevenson, which means you'll experience a little of the high-desert climate along with fewer crowds and tourists that tend to stick closer to Portland (which is still only 75 miles away). Perched above the confluence of the Columbia and Klickitat Rivers, Lyle draws fishermen from across the Northwest with its outstanding salmon and steelhead runs each year. Outdoors lovers also flock to the Klickitat's excellent kayak runs and the hiking trails in the area, many of which boast jaw-dropping views of the surrounding mountain peaks. For those who would rather explore the Gorge in a more luxurious fashion, the countryside surrounding Lyle is dotted with wineries, farmer's markets, and beautiful restaurants. There are over a dozen wine tasting rooms within minutes of downtown, including the highly respected Syncline Wine Cellars and the small yet lovely COR Cellars. Lyle is scenic and offers plenty of small-town charm, but if you'd like a few more options for dining and shopping, bustling Hood River is less than a 25-minute drive away across the Columbia River. If you're looking for winter recreation as well, just head to Hood River and then up Highway 35 Ã¢â?¬â?? Parkdale is only 28 miles away, skiing at Mt. Hood Meadows about 45 miles up the mountain, and even Government Camp is just over an hour away. Springtime wildflowers, summer hikes, and year-round wine tasting mean that beautiful little Lyle has something special to offer no matter what time of year! When you're seeking a Columbia River Gorge vacation rental, you'll find this under-appreciated historic town makes a wonderful home base for all your adventures.

Orcas Island is 57 beautiful square miles of scenic hills, lakes, sea views, and forests right out of a postcard. Like Lopez Island, a San Juans / Puget Sound vacation rental on Orcas Island is accessible only by boat or plane.

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Seattle/
Vacasa's Seattle vacation rentals offer a front-row seat to the Northwest's largest city. From the iconic Pike Pace Market and the Space Needle to boating on Lake Washington to bar hopping on Capitol Hill, a stay in one of our Puget Sound vacation rentals in the Emerald City - whether for business or leisure - is sure to deliver unforgettable memories with a stunning natural backdrop!

When you visualize Seattle, you probably think about riding the monorail, rainy days, and sipping good, strong coffee - Seattle certainly has all of those things, but there's also the EMP Museum and the Chihuly Garden at the Seattle Center, the waterfront Ferris wheel, or even people-watching in Pioneer Square. View the exhibits at the Seattle Art Museum and the Asian Art Museum, or spend an afternoon strolling through unique shops, galleries, and yes, watching the fish mongers throw seafood around at Pike Place Market! And when you work up an appetite, Seattle has hundreds of dining options. From the Dahlia Lounge right downtown (be sure to end your meal with the made-to-order doughnuts) to a neighborhood snack spot like Hot Cakes Molten Chocolate Cakery in Ballard. Of course, since you'll have a kitchen back at your Seattle getaway, you could always pick up some salmon before heading back and preparing a feast later at your well-stocked Vacasa vacation rental.

While downtown is certainly filled with its share of attractions, Seattle's neighborhoods are packed with their own charms and points of interest. Just northwest of all the hustle and bustle, Queen Anne is up high on a hill and offers amazing, panoramic views of Seattle, while still only a 20 minute walk from attractions like the Space Needle. Belltown sits between Lower Queen Anne to the north and downtown to the south, and is full of shops, restaurants, and home to Sub Pop Records world headquarters. To the north and northeast are the neighborhoods of South Lake Union and Capital Hill - both offering a different view of Seattle, from serene lake views and green spaces to late-hour entertainment and nightlife. Seattle is often called a "city of neighborhoods," and with a visit to this eclectic destination, you'll see why!

In the northwest corner of Washington, Seattle is well-located for a number of day trips. Hop on a Washington State Ferry to the Olympic Peninsula to wander around the Victorian-style town of Pt. Townsend, take a whale watching excursion in Puget Sound, or visit nearby Whidbey Island. The gorgeous San Juan Islands are a bit further away, but an easy plane ride from Seattle - you can head out on the morning, wander around Eastsound or Orcas Island, and be back in your cozy Seattle vacation rental's comfortable bed at night. When it comes to outdoor activities, all of the Pacific Northwest has an abundance of choices and Seattle is no exception. Aside from urban hikes, just a 30-minute drive will put you at a number of gorgeous trails including the Cedar River Trail, Evans Creek Preserve, and Souring Eagle Regional Park. Like it's neighbor Portland to the south, Seattle is one of the most bike-friendly cities on the West Coast. And if you like fishing, you can sign up for a Puget Sound fishing charter and maybe even catch your own dinner! One thing is sure, with a stay in one of our Seattle vacation rentals, you'll discover all that this amazing city has to offer!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Seqium/

Launch your kayak at Sequim Bay, an inlet from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, or catch shrimp, clams, oysters, and crabs at Sequim Bay State Park. Bait a silver salmon along the Dungeness River, or view the majestic herd of Roosevelt elk that roam the foothills of the Olympic Mountains.

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Stanwood/
Located an hour north of Seattle, Stanwood is a commercial center for nearby Camano Island to the west, and the residents of the river valley east of Interstate 5 and north of the Tulalip Indian Reservation. Though its proximity to Camano Island and Puget Sound establishes it geographically as a gateway to the recreational activities and natural abundance of the Sound and the San Juan Archipelago, for much of its history, Stanwood's economic fortunes were tied to the Stillaquamish River (named for one of the early, indigenous tribes) just west of town. Until the railroad and modern highway system, agricultural products and wood from the lumber mills were floated to market on steamboats that plied the river's waters. Though Stanwood's name is derived from the maiden name of the wife of one of the town's founders - D.O. Pearson in 1877 - one is more apt to today to find evidence of the town's predominantly Scandinavian influence. Names like "Viking Village" and "Off Da" are evidence of the influx of Nordic families in the late 1800s. Stanwood is surrounded by farms, shorelines teeming with wildlife, and breathtaking views of the Olympics and the Cascades. Aside from the awesome natural vistas everywhere around Stanwood, there are a number of attractions visitors should see. If you're a Richard Gere fan, the lighthouse located at the tip of Fort Worden State Park, north of Port Townsend, should look familiar. Gere's film, "An Officer and a Gentleman" was filmed around there. Another lighthouse, not similarly associated with filmdom, yet every bit as impressive, is the Point Wilson Lighthouse. Great for hikers, access to the lighthouse is via a sandy beach at the base of two high bluffs. No need to say, with the Stillaquamish River and Camano Island close by, that fishing, hiking, kayaking, and everything outdoors can be found in abundance. Golfers can try their luck at two beautiful and challenging courses: Camaloch, and Kayak Point Golf Course. You won't go hungry in Stanwood! There are 52 eateries serving everything from Thai, to trout, to tacos. Visit one of the many shops and galleries where you can purchase clothing made from alpaca wool or works of art. Visit the Pilchuck Glass School, an actual school where serious students can learn the art of glass-blowing! Or, delve a little deeper into Stanwood's history at the Floyd Norgaard Cultural Center. And Stanwood has their festivals too! In September, celebrate the harvest at Stanwood's annual Harvest Jubilee Festival & Farm Tour. Come around Christmas, and cut your own tree at two different farms in the Stanwood area. No matter when you come, Stanwood is ideally situated to all the great activities and natural beauty of Puget Sound.

Afterwards, you can either stay at the resort and visit the Cascade Dining Room for a lunch of Crab Cakes and Salmon Chowder, or head about two miles east to Walking Man Brewery & Public House to sample award-winning beers like Walking Stick Stout or Barefoot Brown and plates of Steelhead Tacos. Other nearby golf courses include Bonneville Golf Course and Beacon Rock Golf Course in Washougal. If you don't feel like preparing meals back at your Stevenson vacation home, other dining options in town are plentiful. The Big River Grill is the place to go for Northwest cuisine like Smoked Sturgeon Spread and Grilled Wild Salmon. In the mornings, you may just want to start your day at Vibe Cafe Espresso Bar to fuel up for all of your Columbia River Gorge undertakings. You can also make the half hour drive to Hood River for even more restaurant choices. Of course, the Columbia River is the star of the Gorge and from your Stevenson vacation rental you'll be centrally located to enjoy all it has to offer, like a Columbia Gorge Sternwheeler Dining and Sightseeing Cruise.

A charming Stevenson vacation rental puts you right in the middle of the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area.

On the other hand, if you stick close to your Wenatchee lodging, you will still have plenty to do. Take a quick 30-minute drive over to the charming, Bavarian-themed Leavenworth for some shopping and dining, or visit during Leavenworth's famous Oktoberfest for a special experience.

The calmer waters of Lake Chelan and Lake Wenatchee are both less than an hour away, as well. During the winter, fans of snow sports flock to Mission Ridge and Squilchuck State Park to take advantage of the heavy snowfall. Summers are particularly warm and sunny, so head down to the Riverfront Park and find a shady tree to have a picnic under while gazing at the Columbia River. Bring along your bicycle and enjoy the miles of paved trails, or stroll over to the nearby downtown area's shops, restaurants, and other businesses. You could even drive up to Ohme Gardens and admire the gorgeous landscaping while taking a gentle one-mile hike around the grounds.

Because this area has such fertile land, you will pass by many orchards, vineyards, and farms on the outskirts of town. The fruit industry in particular helps fuel this town and provides many activities for visitors to enjoy.

Within a short drive of town you can also visit wineries, breweries, and cideries that transform these fresh crops into flavorful beverages.

In Washougal, a walk through the Steigerwald Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a joy for both hikers and bird watchers, as the refuge is hope to over 200 species of birds including Prairie Falcons, Black-necked Stilts, American Avocets, Burrowing Owls, Loggerhead Shrikes, and Sage Thrashers.

In addition to that water activity, the Columbia Gorge also offers kayaking, paddle boarding, and sailing. After working up an appetite during the day, you'll want to head to downtown Washougal and Amnesia Brewing for pints of Dusty Trail Pale Ale, or Hearth Wood Oven Bistro for oven roasted trout and artisan pizzas. A short drive east to Stevenson or Hood River will bring even more dining options.

Couples as well as families find this resort town a welcoming destination, and our Playa del Carmen vacation rentals are the perfect home-away-from-home in this bustling seaside town on the Riviera Maya.

Playa means beach, and Playa del Carmen doesn't disappoint with its great beaches! Playacar is the best spot in town. The north side can teem with tourists, so head to the more secluded and relaxing south side to avoid the crowds. If you're looking for a bit of adventure, look no further than Cenote Chaak Tun. These caves offer a place to admire stalactites and stalagmites as well as a chance to snorkel. Bring the kids, as families are welcome! Playa del Carmen is also a shopper's paradise.

The street is also home to myriad restaurants and bars, including the Hard Rock Cafe and Senor Frogs. The town is a diving mecca thanks to the coral reefs off shore.

Coba is arguably the most celebrated attraction in the area. Just two hours from Playa, here you'll find a well-preserved Mayan city, rediscovered 120 years ago.

Nestled in the jungle between Playa del Carmen and Tulum lies The Jungle Place Spider Monkey Conservancy. Owners Heidi and Joel rescue malnourished, ill, and abused spider monkeys, often victims of the illegal pet trade. Book an appointment, learn about the species, and make a donation to their care.

Home to countless major festivals, street music and artists, and heaps of delicious food from the surrounding sea and valleys, you can truly soak up the Chilean culture with our Valparaíso lodging options.

Besides the beauty and business of the city of Valparaíso, the surrounding hillsides and the nearby Reserva Nacional Lago Peñuelas provide more picturesque scenery as well as places to explore. Lake Peñuelas is a man-made lake created in the early 20th century that's become a mecca for bird-watching, wildlife sight-seeing, and hiking/exploring.

The city is known for a wealth of cultural and historic attractions. The most visited site in town is the Panama Canal. Built in 1914 at the behest of President Teddy Roosevelt to control trade routes, the canal is a modern engineering marvel. The 50-mile waterway transports ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific via gravity-powered locks, of which the Miraflores is the most intricate. Boat tours take you on an up-close and personal journey of the canal and the Panama Canal Museum boasts interactive exhibits about this example of American ingenuity. Don't miss the Bridge of the Americas, which spans the Pacific entrance to the canal, and connects North and South America.

After you've checked the must-see Panama Canal off your list, head to Casco Viejo, the city's historic district. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site to behold, with historic plazas and grand old homes on just three avenues. Situated nearby is the Frank Gehry-designed BioMuseo, featuring 13,000 square feet of exhibition space focusing on Panama's unique place in the world.

To learn a little more about the subcultures of Panama, pay a visit to the mock village of Mi Pueblito to visit replica structures depicting the Afro-Caribbean, native, and interior cultures of the nation. You can tour a colonial building displaying polleras and antiques from the 19th century.

Although it's a thriving metropolis, Panama City still has plenty of green spaces and outdoor attractions. Head to the top of Ancon Hill, a nearly 700-foot-tall landmass overlooking the city that has been thankfully saved from urbanization. You might spy sloths or nine-banded armadillos on your two-hour hike!

The Metropolitan National Park was completed in 1985 and preserves native flora and fauna, providing visitors a place to enjoy nature at its finest. The Amador Causeway links four small islands and is a great place to jog or ride a bike for a view of the ships passing in the night. Heading to the beach won't take long, as Playa Coronado is just one hour away from Panama City, and boasts miles of white sand and big city conveniences.

Heading out of Panama City, you'll come across quaint villages and of course, beautiful beaches. Comarca Kuma Yala is one of the most popular beach destinations in the country with more than 350 islands off the Caribbean coast. You'll get white powder, turquoise water and coral reefs. Don't leave without having a conversation with the Kuna people, the indigenous caretakers of this land.

Isla Colba is the country's number one diving destination with idyllic spots to sunbathe and laze the day away. The coffee capital of Boquete is a few hours by car from Panama City, but shouldn't be missed if you are a lover of the bean. The interior provinces are a world away from the heavily-treaded coastal towns, and you'll find charming mountain villages that celebrate Carnaval as if it's every day.

Sun, culture and history await you in lovely Panama City. For a relaxing stay in Panama, our Panama City vacation rentals are the perfect home away from home!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Italy/Lazio/Rome/
Roma...the Eternal City! Words to describe the magic of Rome are hard to come by, but the beauty of this sparkling city speaks for itself.

With a couple millennia of history under its belt, Rome is home to some of the oldest and most famous ruins on earth...but the food, art, and dazzling nightlife will suit the most modern tastes. With around 4.3 million people, this is a true city of grit-and-grind, but the juxtaposition of ancient buildings and vibrant culture make it an unforgettable experience.

With countless things to do and places to see, our Rome vacation rentals have it all!

Thanks to its role as "the birthplace of Western civilization", Rome is brimming with ancient sites and spectacles that you absolutely must cross off the bucket list. The historic centre of the city is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site, and the most-visited tourist attraction in Italy.

You can walk to most of the popular spots, starting with the magnificent Colosseum (built in 70-80 A.D.) and the Arch of Constantine. The Pantheon has a buzzing energy that's all its own, and has been in continuous use as a spiritual center of sorts for centuries.

The Trevi Fountain is gorgeous during the day or night, but make sure you throw three coins in as not to break tradition! The Spanish Steps are no easy task to climb, but the bright flowers along the edge and view at the top are worth it. You'll get the full Italian feeling out on the narrow cobblestone streets, and there are hundreds of boutiques and restaurants to visit - be sure to try as many gelato flavors you can muster!

Sometimes called "the capital of two states", Rome also houses the Vatican City - the smallest internationally recognized independent state in the world. As the capital of the Catholic Church and home to the Pope, Vatican City is a point of pilgrimage for millions, but also an extremely interesting place to visit regardless of your religious affiliation.

St. Peter's Basilica is stunning with its towering Duomo, ornate artworks, and famous sculptures - climb to the top for an incredible panoramic view of Rome and St. Peter's Square. The Vatican museums offer world-class pieces of art, but the Sistine Chapel is truly the gem of this place, with its spectacular ceiling painted by Michelangelo. Try to keep quiet as you turn your eyes upwards, lest the Italian guards remind you!

?There are several options for day trips from our collection of Rome vacation rentals, and you likely won't even need a vehicle thanks to the high-speed trains that run in and out of the city. Just west, the Tyrrhenian Sea offers picturesque coastline and sandy beaches where you can soak up the sun, and the Pontine Islands to the south provide a quiet place of seclusion.

?The Apennine Mountains are also accessible by train, and there are several ski resorts that offer snowy outdoor adventure options. Rome's surrounding countryside is beautiful and filled with rolling hills, vineyards, and olive trees. Sabina is a great place to visit thanks to its rich culture and proximity to the country, and your tastebuds will thank you after trying some of the wines!

Whatever way you choose to enjoy this unbelievable city, your time spent in one of our Rome vacation rentals will not disappoint!

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Australia/Queensland/Brisbane/
Australia has many capital cities, but none so unique and culturally diverse as Brisbane. We have a diverse selection of Australia vacation rentals, but our Brisbane vacation rentals are the perfect way to experience this thriving metropolis in the heart of sunny Queensland.

Sitting on the Brisbane River and abutting the Pacific Ocean and New South Wales, the city of Brisbane has long been synonymous with adventure, sun, and fun! Settled by Europeans in 1823, Brisbane was once one of the harshest penal colonies in the land. However, it has transformed and is now one of the most economically booming cities in the entire country. With a world-class infrastructure (it has one of the best public transit systems in the nation), an educated populace, and a cool and hip vibe, it's no wonder Australia's new world city is one of the most popular destinations in the Antipodes.

Brisbane is a cultural mecca with a diverse range of attractions. The Gallery of Modern Art boasts rotating exhibits, as well as permanent displays of Aussie abstract and expressionist art. The Queensland Museum Sciencentre features an array of natural and scientific works, including ethnographic, biodiverse, and culturally-sensitive collections. Kids of all ages (and adults who are young at heart) will be entranced by the elaborate dinosaur exhibit.

The Macarthur Museum commemorates American General Douglas MacArthur's campaign in the South Pacific, as well as the city's involvement in the WWII. You'll experience history firsthand during your visit because Macarthur used the museum as a base during wartime. Head to the Queensland Maritime Museum to admire the warship Diamantina, the 1925 steam tug Forceful, and the South Brisbane Dry Dock. The Second/Fourteenth Light Horse Regiment (QMI) Museum honors Royal Australian Armoured Corps vets from the Second World War on and proudly displays uniforms, artifacts, and medals from the famed Light Horse brigade.

Take a ride in a vintage tram through bushland at The Brisbane Tramway Museum or stroll through the charming gardens and colonial architecture at Ormiston House, a former sugar plantation.

Brisbane basks under 12 months of sunshine and al fresco entertaining is common, even in the winter. Locals often head to city parks on weekdays and beaches on the Sunshine and Gold Coast on weekends.

The Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mount Coot-tha has 138 acres of subtropical plants arranged via geographic region, including those indigenous to the continent. The Fern House is also a particular delight. The City Botanic Gardens features a wealth of gorgeous plants, as well as ornamental ponds and bamboo groves. The Weeping Fig Avenue is perfect for romantic strolls.

Brisbane is located near two national parks that are worth a detour. Hikers of all abilities head to Moreton Island National Park, just 25 miles offshore. It boasts a lighthouse, as well lagoons, coastal heaths, sand dunes, and fort ruins. The beaches are a great spot to spend hot summer days. Just 38 miles north lies Bribie Island National Park, a unique park that boasts plentiful fishing in Pumicestone Passage and great bush camping.

Diverse, cultured, and truly laid-back, Brisbane delights all who venture here! Our Brisbane vacation rentals will have you feeling recharged and relaxed in no time!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/New-Zealand/Otago/
One of the largest regions on the South Island, Otago is also one of the most scenic areas in New Zealand. Boasting nearly 20,000 square miles of mountains, plains, rivers, valleys, and beaches, a variety of adventures await you in Otago! Kayak through caves, watch for wild seals, chase the powder down world-renowned ski slopes, or bungee jump off a platform into the unknown. From adrenaline-pumping activities to relaxing retreats, it's all here and our Otago vacation rentals will allow you to experience all that this scenic region on New Zealand's South Island has to offer!

Maori have been here for centuries, but it wasn't until 1848 that Europeans first arrived on these shores. The Scotsmen of yesteryear became the Kiwis of today and, as you travel throughout Otago, you will see symbols of Scottish pride.

This region is one of sharp contrasts, with diverse topography ranging from snow-capped peeks to verdant forests to pristine lakes. There's gold in them thar hills and the gold is wine, particularly Pinot Noir and Riesling! The semi-arid soil of the region makes it a bonafide wine-growing mecca. Couple that with adventurous activities such as bungee jumping and zip lining and you have a must-see vacation spot! It's up to you how you choose to spend your holiday, but our Otago vacation rentals are the perfect place to rest your weary head after a fun-filled day.

The largest city is Dunedin, located on the southeastern coast. Looking out onto the Pacific Ocean, this city boasts many picturesque hills and is a major cruise ship port of call. With nearly 7,000 species of plants on a 70-acre site, the Dunedin Botanic Garden is definitely worth a visit. Don't forget to admire the many well preserved Victorian and Edwardian structures around town!

Queenstown is arguably one of the most popular stops in the entire country and for good reason! It's the adventure capital of the world, boasting a wealth of spots for bungee jumping, hot air balloon rides, and zip lining. Take a helicopter ride through the Remarkables or drift though the stillness of majestic Milford Sound. Still, this town is more than just someplace to get your adrenaline rush! It has a thriving restaurant scene, thanks to award-winning chefs and culinary maestros.

If you're a wine lover, you won't want to miss Central Otago where Pinot Noir is King. Hop into a Mercedes and head to a variety of vineyards such as Mt. Edward, Akarua, and Chard Farm. Stop in for lunch at Carrick in bucolic Bannockburn or savor a delightful al fresco dinner at Amisfield Winery & Bistro on Lake Hayes. Make sure to grab your bike and head down the Central Otago Rail Trail, which follows an old railway path.

Rugged cliffs and abundant waterfalls get top billing in the beautiful and unspoiled Catlins on the southeast coast. You're truly off the beaten track here! North Otago is all about Oamuru and its old stone buildings. Wanaka is known for its trekking and ski resorts. Hit the slopes for some uncrowded powder or explore Mt. Aspiring National Park.

With gorgeous peaks, lush valleys, and plenty to do, Otago should be on everyone's itinerary. Book one of our Otago vacation rentals today!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/New-Zealand/Otago/Wanaka/
Sleepier than Queenstown but still packing an adventure wallop, Wanaka, New Zealand, is a gem of a town in the South Island. Situated on its namesake Lake Wanaka with the Southern Alps as a dramatic backdrop, the town lies in the heart of the Otago region and is the gateway to the Mt. Aspiring National Park and two large ski resorts. Relax and unwind after a day of adrenaline-pumping activities at one of our breathtaking Wanaka vacation rentals!

First settled by Maori, Europeans came in droves to Wanaka during the mid-19th-century gold rush. Many stayed behind when the gold ran out and today, the town is known as a skier's mecca and a popular place to retire.

Situated on the southern end of Lake Wanaka, Wanaka is a popular resort town in the heart of the Otago region, near Mt. Aspiring National Park on New Zealand's South Island. Wanaka is conveniently located approximately 62 km (about an hour's drive) from the Queenstown Airport (ZQN).

Lake Wanaka is the main draw and, as New Zealand's fourth largest lake, it is a sight to behold, with crystal clear waters and pristine forests. You can hike or bike around it or kayak, sail, or fish on its iridescent surface. Wanaka is also considered a gateway to New Zealand's Great Walks, nine walking tracks that allow you to explore all that this incredible country has to offer!

Wanaka is the gateway to Mt. Aspiring National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mountains rise majestically over the lake at nearly 10,000 feet, looking down on us mere mortals. The park is replete with beautiful glaciers, rivers, picturesque waterfalls, and jurassic-like forests where few humans have ventured.

Skiing is king in Wanaka and, with two of the best ski areas in the entire country, you'll never want to leave the slopes. Treble Cone is the largest ski resort on the South Island and boasts some of the most uncrowded runs you will ever come across! Cardrona Alpine Resort is perfect for beginners due to its terrain parks. Snow Farm Lodge is the perfect spot for cross-country skiing, sledding, or snow shoeing.

There are many other activities to choose from year-round, from horseback riding treks through Rippon Vineyards to biplane rides over the lake to heli-skiing on the Harris Mountains!

Arguably the hottest spot in town is Puzzling World. This family-friendly spot showcases rooms of illusion, as well as a 3D super maze, a hologram hall, and stranger-than-strange public toilets.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/New-Zealand/Otago/Queenstown/
Maori originally flocked here in search of pounamu, a type of jade that was of cultural importance. The Europeans sought gold here in 1862 and, while gold is still mined, the rush is over. But that thirst for adventure can still be found in Queenstown today! You'll meet friendly people, a laid-back atmosphere, and adventure as far as the eye can see. Stay at a Queenstown bach (the traditional New Zealand term for small vacation rental or holiday home) and you'll see for yourself why this is the hottest destination in all of New Zealand!

The highest point in town, Bob's Peak is considered to be adventure central in Queenstown. Ride the Skyline Gondola to the top and take your pick of fun activities. Want to zip line? They have it here. Want to canyon swing? They have it here. Want to bungee jump? They have it here, natch. Kids (and those young at heart) will love the two-track luge, which traverses cliff edges offering breathtaking views of the majestic peaks in the distance. After a day of activities on the summit, head down via mountain bike on the wealth of great track as you watch the Douglas Firs give way to Mountain Beech.

If you want to head out onto the water, the best way to do it is via the TSS Earnslaw. The iconic steamship makes several daily trips across Lake Wakatipu. You can explore the decks or view the engine room (they still use coal to fire it!) as you take in the sites and sounds of Queenstown.

There are a wealth of other fantastic activities to fill your days, such as helicopter tours to Lake Isabelle, high in The Remarkables, a nearby mountain range. Shoot clay pigeons with a Beretta 12-gauge shotgun or settle into the Hydro Attack, a cross between a fighter jet and a torpedo. The latter looks like a shark, traveling 50 mph under the water before rocketing through the air about 18 feet.

One of the best ways to see the town and the surrounding vistas is by hot air balloon. These early morning rides having you soaring near the clouds, savoring the scenic beauty of the Otago region. It will literally take your breath away! If you feel like hiking, Queenstown is considered to be a gateway to the Great Walks, nine walking tracks that go through the awe-inspiring landscapes of New Zealand.

Queenstown is not just an outdoor destination nonpareil. If you want to stay indoors, there's plenty to see and do. The Queenstown Arts Centre features local arts and crafts in permanent and revolving exhibits. Queenstown is home to a wealth of art galleries, showcasing local artists. Some of the best include the David John gallery, the Artbay gallery, and the Graham Brinsley gallery.

The Lakes District Museum & Gallery, one of the smallest and most cherished museums in the country, sits in the gold-mining town of Arrowtown, just 15 minutes away. The museum displays Maori relics, as well as artifacts from the gold rush era of the mid-1800s.

Historic Dudley's Cottage, also in Arrowtown, is a family-friendly spot that teaches kid's gold panning and the town's gold-mining history. You can also stroll around the gardens for a relaxing interlude between action-packed activities.

Action and adventure equals Queenstown, one of the hottest destinations in the world. Book a Queenstown vacation rental today to see for yourself why everyone loves this city at the bottom of the world!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Balearic-Islands/
If you head to Spain, no spot will get more covetous comments from your friends back home than the gorgeous Balearic Islands. These three idyllic isles in the Mediterranean - party-hardy Ibiza, luxe Mallorca, and tranquil Menorca - boast sandy beaches, turquoise water, well-preserved ruins, and charming city boulevards. Any of our Balearic Islands vacation rentals will bring this magical land of sand and sea to you.

The Phoenicians were the first lucky inhabitants, settling here in 654 BC. The Romans, Visigoths, and Moors followed in quick succession. A busy trading center for several centuries, the area went into decline due to piracy and famine. The British ruled until 1802 but it wasn't until the 1950s that the islands' fortunes reversed. Today, all three destinations boast considerable wealth thanks to tourism. Hedonism reigns supreme in Ibiza, which sees an influx of more than two million tourists each year alone. Still, Mallorca and Menorca offer charm and relaxation aplenty and our Balearic Islands vacation rentals reinforce that feeling.

If nightlife is your scene and bikini-clad merrymaking your goal, than look no further than Ibiza. The party-loving isle is home to a club scene that rivals 1970s Manhattan. DJs are the celebrities de rigueur and many a party hopper will revel in the myriad spots to dance the night away. Still, to claim Ibiza is only for hedonists would be a disservice to this lovely island.

Ibiza City is the main port of call and while it is club-central, there are plenty of historic sites and boulevards to get lost among. The Ibiza Cathedral dominates the skyline and the whitewashed buildings of the old quarter, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Stroll through the Roman Aqueducts or The Necropolis Puig des Molins a former Phoenician settlement with 3,000 burial caverns and a museum featuring terracotta figurines. Head to the Ramparts, a fortification built on the Portal de ses Taules in 1585, which overlooks the city. The Ibiza Museu d'Art Contemporani displays a unique collection including drawings by local Mari Ribas Portmany. On the south side of the island, don't miss the well-maintained Phoenician archaeological site in Sa Caleta.

Your Ibiza holiday will features several beaches that offer a respite from the young, alcohol-fueled crowd. Cala Llenya and Cala Mastella are both small beaches (the former with soft sand, the latter with small pebbles) that are far from the madding crowds. Cala de Boix is a place to enjoy the blue water in peace and Es Figueral boasts golden sand in a turquoise-infused cove.

While Ibiza draws a younger, boisterous crowd, Mallorca in contrast is all about luxury and refinement. Many European celebrities call it home, including Rafael Nadal, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, and Claudia Schiffer. While the main city, Palma de Mallorca, and certain coastal areas have crowded beaches and cafes, the southern part of the island boasts unspoiled golden sand and nary a tourist in sight. Hike natural parks or the Tramuntana Mountains, cycle past castles and ruins, or sunbathe on more than 200 beaches.

Alaro Castle is the first stop here. Head up by foot and admire the fortifications that resisted the invasion of Alfonso II of Aragon. The Lluc Monastery is a great walk for anyone wanting to admire the mountain scenery. Capdepera Castle boasts a watchtower and housed the island's governor in the 14th century. Pollentia Alcudia is the only Roman ruin on the island. Almudaina Palace, built by the Moors in the 14th century, is now the national museum of Mallorca.

A number of great, quiet beaches await. Cala d'en Borgit is a secluded beach that's perfect for sweethearts. Cala Falco is sheltered in a cove and is great for children due to its shallow waters. Sa Rapita is another beach offering privacy as well as spots to surf, windsurf, and enjoy family fun. Your Mallorca holiday is sure to be a dream!

While Ibiza and Mallorca get the majority of those on holiday on the Balearics, Menorca is the hidden gem of the chain. Quiet and charming, the island offers a pleasing respite from the cacophony of Ibiza and Mallorca. The entire island is a UNESCO natural biosphere, which helps preserve the tranquil, rural nature of the land. You'll find rare plants as well as cozy cafes and secluded beaches at which to while away the hours.

The town of Ciutadella was built in the 14th century and is worth a tour. You can head through the bastion of Sa Font, a medieval wall that was rebuilt in the 17th century. The Llatzeret, another fort, was commissioned to keep out the Bubonic plague in 1793. The Museum of Menorca is based on a 15th century Franciscan monastery and highlights the history of occupation on the island.

Menorca has a plethora of beaches on both the north and south side of the island. The south side beaches are more touristy. Head to Mitjana, Turqueta, Son Bou, or Trebaluger for white sand and turquoise water. The north side beaches are bit harder to reach and due to that, offer plentiful seclusion. You'll spy terracotta-colored clay and coarser sand here. Cala Morell is great for snorkeling. Cala Tortuga and Pregonda are truly remote and offer peaceful coves for luxurious privacy.

Regardless of which Balearic Island seems right for you, you'll find historic sites, charming city streets, golden sand, and friendly locals. With our Balearic Island vacation rentals, you can trul
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Balearic-Islands/Alcudia/
Many Mallorcan towns are filled with lovely architecture and beautiful landscapes. But none more so than the charming medieval town of Alcúdia on the north side of Mallorca. This restored walled city, once a Roman settlement, boasts ruins aplenty. You can admire them all from our Alcúdia holiday rentals.

The first known settlers where the Phoenicians and Greeks in the second century BC. The Romans followed and helped build sewers, streets, and fortifications. The town thrived under Moorish rule and the 1492 Reconquest brought more improvements including the wall around the city. Today, Alcúdia is a mix of old and new world, with a distinctly medieval vibe. Our Alcúdia holiday rentals will let you explore this town at your leisure.

Entering the old town through one of two gates, you're immediately transported to a bygone era. The Portal de Moll, with its two square towers, rises up to greet you as soon as you enter. The first stop on any itinerary is the Pollentia Alcúdia, a Roman ruin and the only one of its kind on the entire island of Mallorca. Stroll through an amphitheater, forum, and the remnants of ancient houses.

Hidden away from the main thoroughfare, you'll find the La Fundación Yannick y Ben Jakober: Museu Sa Bassa Blanca featuring contemporary paintings, sculptures, and a beautiful rose garden exemplifying the Balearic Islands.

Port d'Alcudia boasts a quaint marina where fishermen ply their trade. You'll find several great beaches at which to relax. Playa de Sant Joan is a small shallow beach perfect for young children. Playa de Aucanada features a small bay but plentiful golden sand. You have to trek a bit to get to Playa Coll Baix but, it's well worth the effort due to its breathtaking views and secluded nature. If the beach is not your cup of tea, take the family to Hidropark a waterpark with myriad water slides and pools.

The north side of Mallorca features wonderful coastal towns and sleepy hamlets you'll want to explore. You'll find the largest contemporary art museum on the island in lovely Andratx. Sóller sits between the mountains and the sea and offers a modernist museum with works by Picasso and Miro. Pollença has several museums as well as cloisters. Palma de Mallorca is only 40 miles away if you crave nightlife and high-end shopping.

Historic yet eminently charming, Alcúdia is one of the top destinations in Spain. So why not book one of our Alcúdia holiday rentals today?
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Balearic-Islands/Andratx/
Lying at the foot of the Tramuntana Mountains - a UNESCO World Heritage Site - and built several miles inland from its port city to deter pirate raids in the 15th century, Andratx is a sleepy town boasting plentiful natural beauty. A stay at one of our Andratx holiday rentals will let you see for yourself why so many Europeans in the know find this town so fascinating.

Like the rest of Mallorca, Andratx was home to Romans, Moors, and others throughout history. A traditional Mallorcan town, its character and vibe hasn't changed much over the centuries. You're just as likely to see a villager hawking his wares at the weekly market as you would a tourist snapping postcard-worthy shots of the mountains. It's no wonder our Andratx holiday rentals are such a hit.

Although smaller than other mountain towns in the region, Andratx still boasts plenty of appeal. Christian pilgrims invariably visit the 13th century Santa Maria church in town. You can see its tower peaking through the trees as you drive through the valley. The CCA Andratx Art Centre is the largest modern art museum on the island. You'll find paintings, sculptures, installations, and photos from world-renowned and local artists. It also hosts three international exhibitions a year and its artist-in-residence program is one of the most accessible in all of Spain.

Set amid orange and almond trees, Andratx is the definition of beauty. Trekkers will especially like the town as a base for hiking in the area. Three area hikes take you on three- to six-mile journeys up the mountains to an elevation of more than 1,000 feet.

After a day of hiking, you may be in the mood for a glass of Sherry. Port d'Andratx is less than four miles away and is a cozy fishing village popular with yachters and European movie stars. The harbor is one of the prettiest in all of Mallorca and the town boasts a plethora of waterside bars and eateries that offer sublime food and people watching. The Cala Llamp Bay beach is idyllic and tranquil in the off season, but becomes a veritable bastion of eye candy come midsummer.

Andratx is on the western end of Mallorca, but the entire island is easily accessible from it. Palma de Mallorca is less than 18 miles to the east and boasts plenty of nightlife offerings. Medieval and charming Alcúdia is known for its Roman ruins, Pollença is all about the cloisters, and Sóller has a Natural History Museum and botanical gardens that shouldn't be missed.

Small-town hospitality and natural wonder await you at one of our Andratx holiday rentals.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Balearic-Islands/Pollenca/
If you want to enjoy a truly Mallorcan way of life, then head to the sleepy town of Pollença. Cafe culture and siestas reign supreme here, so sit back, relax, and savor a Palo (a liqueur only made on Mallorca) at one our Pollença holiday rentals.

Settled by the Romans in 123 BC, Pollença became a true town during the Moorish invasion. Irrigation systems helped the land thrive until the Black Death wreaked havoc in the 14th century. Medieval remnants from this time abound, making it one of the most charming towns in all of Mallorca. A Pollença holiday rental is the perfect base from which to explore this beautiful city.

Character and charm go hand in hand in Pollença. You'll find narrow lanes winding around picturesque squares. The main square, Plaça Major, is home to Nostra Senyora dels Àngels, a church built in the 18th century that is known for its gorgeous rose window.

The Convent de Sant Domingo, built over the course of 30 years in the 16th century, boasts a baroque cloister with four porticos and the Museum of Pollença. The latter features ancient sculptures shaped like bulls and a Tibetan sand painting donated by the Dalai Lama. You can admire the work of Atilio Boveri as well as the lush Joan March Gardens, honoring a local hero. The Dionis Bennassar Museum highlights the works of the local artist.

The Roman Bridge shouldn't be missed as it's one of the few remaining pieces of Roman architecture on the island. Lighthouses are often seen as American phenomenons but the Formentor Lighthouse helped Mallorcan seafarers at night in the 19th century.

Hikers and bikers will love the area since it's in the scenic and challenging Tramuntana Mountains. Trails such as Cala Boquer, Coves Blanques, and Camí vell de Lluc take you through scenic passes and pine-laden hills. Bird watchers from all over Europe head here to catch a glimpse of more than 240 different bird species.

You won't find sandy beaches here but you will find lovely inlets with blue water and places to swim and reflect on life. Cala Barques, Cala Clara, Cala Molins, and Cala Carbó are perfect for scuba divers or snorkelers who want to explore prehistoric caves as well as sunken ships. Promenades abound in the Port of Pollença, at which there is a sandy beach for family fun.

Mallorca is small, so traversing its hills and valleys shouldn't take too long. Palma de Mallorca and its busy nightlife is only  37 miles away on the south side of the island. The medieval city of Alcúdia lies just seven miles to the south and boasts plentiful Roman ruins. Visit the largest contemporary art museum on the island in lovely Andratx. Sóller lies between the mountains and the sea and offers the Natural History Museum as well as a modernist museum with works by Picasso and Miro.

Relaxation and historic sites get top billing in lovely Pollença. Stay at one of our Pollença holiday rentals and see for yourself why it appeals to thousands of tourists a year.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Balearic-Islands/Soller/
Between the Tramuntana Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, lies Sóller, on Mallorca's northwest coast. This popular town holds tremendous appeal due to its old-world charm, bountiful orange and olive groves, and cute boutiques. Explore it all via our Sóller holiday rentals.

First inhabited by the Phoenicians, the town suffered numerous pirate attacks in subsequent centuries with its position near the coast. An agricultural mecca, orange, lemon, and olive groves proliferated as trade with France increased in the 17th century. The train to Palma was created in 1912 to boost orange transport to the rest of Mallorca and beyond. Today, Sóller is a town that still thrives on agriculture but tourism is a booming industry. A stay at a Sóller holiday rental will let you explore this charming and unassuming town at your leisure.

Sóller boasts activities and sites aplenty. New visitors invariably first head to the Church of Sant Bartomeu, situated in the the town square. The 13th century house of worship features baroque and modernist architecture. You'll also want to visit the Convento de los Sagrados Corazones, a 18th-century convent with a cloister and Baroque church.

A stroll through the maze-like old town, with its structures from the 14th century on, will eventually find you at La Posada de Can Prohom, La Casa de la Luna, and La Posada de Moncaire, three historic buildings admired by architecture buffs for their Baroque and neoclassic style.

Architecture and history aficionados are not the only ones who find Sóller appealing. Art and nature lovers will surely delight in all the town has to offer. The Balearic Museum of Natural Sciences features a collection of fossils and and the Botanical Gardens of Sóller offers native flora in abundance. Can Prunera is a can't-miss spot for its works by Picasso and Miro, among others. The Museu del Casal de Cultura, situated in an 18th-century manor home, offers relics from long ago.

Take the Ferrocarril de Sóller, the vintage train, to Palma and back again. It's a great way to see the island, from mountain, to valley, to blue sea, and better than battling traffic to the coast during the heady days of summer.

Sóller is known for its plentiful, well-marked hiking trails. Mountain bikers seek out these routes as well. Cami del Rost, a three-hour trek from Sóller to Finca S'Heretat shouldn't be missed. The views of Lluc-Alcari will surely be remembered for years to come.

The northwest coast of Mallorca is the perfect base from which to explore the entire island. Andratx offers the largest contemporary art museum on the island. Alcúdia is a medieval town with Roman ruins and a gem of a contemporary art museum. Pollença has several museums as well as cloisters. Palma de Mallorca is just over 35 miles away if you crave nightlife and the crowds that come with it.

You'll not want to miss this part of Spain. Breathe in the mountain air and inhale the scent of ripe oranges as you relax in one of our Sóller holiday rentals.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/
With 265 municipalities in its 4,156 square miles, the province of Valencia (one of three in the Valencian Community) in Spain is a treasure trove of sensory delights. From the bustling capital of Valencia to its mountainous interior to its verdant vineyards and orange grove-filled plains, the birthplace of paella inspires and excites. A stay at our Valencia holiday rentals will surely excite you as well.

Settled first by the Phoenicians, later the Romans, Visigoths, and Moors all invaded in successive centuries. The region hit its stride in the 13th century when it was granted autonomy by James I, King of Aragon. It soon became a center for trade and the creative arts. In 1833, Valencia gained its statehood. Today, with Alicante and Castello, it makes up the Valencian Community, an area of Spain that borders the Gulf of Valencia to the east and Aragon and Castile-La Mancha to the north and west.

Separated into 14 counties, Valencia boasts a wealth of delights for history buffs, architecture aficionados, beach combers, wine enthusiasts, and nature lovers. Our Valencia holiday rentals are the best spot to explore this varied and exciting land.

One of the province's northern counties, El Campo de Morvedre has a number of historical sites to explore. The town of Sagunto is famous for its Roman monuments, especially the Castle of Sagunto. You can walk among the fortifications, one of the best kept secrets in all of Spain. Don't forget the Sagunto Roman Theatre or the Fortress of Murviedro. The latter served as a sanctuary for Jews during the Spanish Inquisition.

Home to Roman settlements, El Camp de Turia boasts the lovely capital of Llíria featuring a great old town. Explore the Monasterio de Sant Miquel and the Iglesia de la Sangre if you want to see houses of worship. The walled village of Benisanó boasts a castle and Serra has the Cartuja de Portaceli, a working monastery. You can walk and hike the gorgeous Parque Natural de la Sierra Calderona, too.

Often called the Forgotten Corner of Valencia, El Rincón de Ademuz is a Valencian island that is nature personified. Hikers will love this region for the Parque Nacional de la Puebla de San Miguel, one of the country's newest national parks, and for Monte Calderón, the highest peak in the region.

Well known in the region for its hiking trails, El Valle de Ayora-Cofrentes is on the western fringes of the province. You'll find castles as well as cozy streets and narrow boulevards. But it's the long and short distance hiking trails that lure the most tourists here.

Separated into three regions, L'Horta surrounds the capital city of Valencia and boasts a wealth of beautiful beaches and lovely farmland. Rural and majestic, La Canal de Navarres sits under the Caroig Massif and is a picturesque province of farms and small towns with an uber-friendly vibe.

In central Valencia lies La Costera and the ancient town of Xàtiva. Admire the large mountain massif that serves as a backdrop to the town and the rich and fertile land here. Archaeology buffs will get inspired at Cova Negra, a Mousterian site at which Neanderthal remains were found in 2013. The Castle of Xàtiva was once in the hands of the Moors and still bears remnants from that time.

Another agricultural region, La Ribera Alta is also the second most densely populated area of the province. The towns of La Pobla Llarga, Carcaixent, and Alzira all boast a variety of historical sites from churches to Neolithic settlements to a hermitage. Carcaixent is of particular note as the birthplace of the orange.

You'll find beaches aplenty in La Ribera Baixa. This area is also home to the Parc Natural de la l'Albufera, which offers the largest lake in the country as well as numerous wetlands.

If sunbathing is your primary goal, then head to La Safor. Fertile orange groves on the hills give way to sandy and unspoiled beaches in Oliva. The regional capital of Gandía features the luxurious Palau Ducal de Gandía, which once belonged to the infamous House of Borgia.

Mountainous with verdant valleys, La Serranía is one of the prettiest areas in Valencia. You'll find towering mountains amidst lush vineyards producing a variety of wines, such as the Alto Turia varietal. The Benagéber Reservoir is home to a host of water sports and is an ideal spot to commence hiking in the region, from Turia Canyon to the Cherales Valley.

Called the white valley by the Moors, La Vall d'Albaida is surrounded by mountains, both the Serra Grossa and the Benicadell, Mariola, and Agullent. The region is known for its numerous hiking trails and nature preserves. Explore the Sierra de Mariola National Park or the Umb
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Altea/
Charming and eminently inviting, Altea is one of the most authentic towns on the Costa Blanca. With more than three miles of coastline and a small town vibe, you'll feel as if you've been transported to a quieter time. An Altea holiday rental offers the perfect spot to take in all of the sites and sounds of this wonderful village on the Mediterranean.

The Greeks and Romans made this region a trade center and factories producing dried salt fish sprung up overnight. The Moors brought improvements to the agriculture and irrigation, harnessing the power of the Algar River, the city's main tributary. Unfortunately, Barbary pirates almost destroyed the town in the 17th century. Thankfully, Altea has survived and its unique charm and friendly locals with it. Stay at one of our Altea holiday rentals to see it for yourself.

Altea's Renaissance Area, high on a hill, boasts a variety of well-preserved buildings from the 18th century on. The most important site in town is the Parroquia Nuestra Señora del Consuelo Church with its iconic blue roof. The Middle Ages brought the Canterería Square Bellaguarda Tower to life and the Moli de Bellaguarda, a mill that supplied water to the town.

A bastion of art and painters, Altea is home to a variety of murals, much like Cannes in France. Stroll through Calle Salamanca or Il San Miguel and you'll find the works of Marc-Abel and Arturo García Paladini.

There are numerous spots in and near town to hike. The Blue Route hike takes you by the Guadalest and Algar rivers. Head to the Morro de Toix to see geological wonders or the Sierra de Bérnia for fresh air and scenic views of the region and beyond.

Altea's beaches are some of the region's finest, with secluded coves and crystal blue water. Cap Negret, La Roda, and Cap Blanc are all popular spots to sunbathe even if they are more pebbly than sandy.

With its easy-going vibe it will be hard to leave Altea. But the entire Costa Blanca region is at your doorstep, making day trips an easy idea. Dénia, the capital of the Marina Alta region, is nearby as is its myriad historic sites and natural wonders. Calpe and the Peñón de Ifach Nature Reserve, that iconic rock that draws the eye is only seven miles away. The exclusive former fishing village of Moraira is 21 miles away and Javea and its popular beaches is only 22 miles away.

Relax and unwind in one of our Altea holiday rentals in this quaint and tranquil town on the Costa Blanca.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Denia/
Dénia enjoys an enviable reputation as a bustling Costa Blanca town with myriad things to see and do. From historical monuments to gorgeous sandy beaches to natural parks, Dénia offers a wealth of activities for all ages and our Dénia holiday rentals are the perfect perch from which to see it all.

The Iberians first settled this town centuries ago. The Romans brought wealth to the region, and the Muslims even more splendor as Dénia became the seat of the Taifa Kingdom from the 11th century on. Dénia prospered in the 19th century due to the dry raisin trade; toys put it on the map in the 20th century. Today, Denia is a town known for natural wonders, and its monuments bear witness to its unique history. A stay at a Dénia holiday rental will ensure your wellbeing.

More so than other towns in the region, Dénia offers a variety of sites from historical to natural. Archaeology buffs head to the Castell de Dénia, a fortress erected by the Moors in the 11th century. The Archaeology Museum sits alongside the Castell and features artifacts from four periods of Dénian history: the Iberian, Roman, Muslim, and Christian ages.

Climb the Gerro Tower, a watchtower that announced the arrival of the Barbary pirates in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Convent and Church of our Lady of Loreto, once home to Augustinian nuns, houses a church, cloister, and altar sculpture made of pine from the early 1940s.

Dénia was a toy mecca from the early 20th century until the 1960s. The city manufactured tin, wood, and metal toys. Children will delight in the model sailboats, horse- or mule-drawn carriages, and wood kitchen stoves on display. The Ethnographic Museum houses clothing and tools from Dénia's golden age.

A visit to the Baix La Mar neighborhood in the old town shouldn't be missed. This barrio boasts buildings from the 19th century as well as colorful squares to while away the time people watching.

Dénia is not just about history. Nature lovers will find it worthy of exploration. The Cape of San Antonio Marine Reserve features magnificent underwater sights from coral colonies to posidonia prairies. A protected reserve, you can scuba dive here but only with a special license obtained through the tourist office.

Mount Montgó Nature Park offers varied flora and fauna on more than 5,200 acres. Hike five scenic and challenging trails as you admire the maritime fennel, red lavender, royal owls, Audouin seagull, and the pilgrim falcon.

Dénia's beaches feature plentiful sand and caves. To the north of the city, lies the Les Marines area, which features popular sandy beaches such as Punta del Raset, Les Marines, Les Bovetes, Els Molins, L'Almadrava, and Les Deveses. To the south, you can swim through rocky caves in Las Rotas or relax on the sand in La Marineta Casiana.

With great historic sites and beautiful spots to hike, bike, and scuba dive, you'll never want for something to do in Dénia. Our Dénia holiday rentals make it all worthwhile.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Calpe/
With the imposing Rock of Ifach as a backdrop, the town of Calpe on the Costa Blanca in Spain impresses all who come here. You'll find Roman baths, a nature preserve, and beautiful beaches to while away the hours. Our Calpe holiday rentals will immediately get you in a vacation mindset.

Settled by the Romans, Visigoths, and Moors, and long a quiet fishing village, the Calpe of today still offers a languid way of life. The seven-mile coastline remains the main draw with locals and tourists enjoying the sun and seaside many months out of the year. Still, there is more to see than just the sea, from ruins to natural wonder. Our Calpe holiday rentals offer a great base from which to view it all.

Situated in the northern region of Costa Blanca, Calpe is a former fishing village turned popular tourist destination on the Mediterranean coast, about 40 and 76 miles from Alicante and Valencia, respectively.

Calpe is one of the top destinations in all of Costa Blanca. First-time visitors head to the Rock of Ifach, the 1,100-foot-tall monolith that sits at the top of the old town. You get the best views of the port and beach from here and eco-warriors will delight in its protected status. Head to the Baños de la Reina, the remains of a Roman fish-salting factory.

You're steps from the old town, bordered by walls built in the 15th century, and the Moorish quarter of El Arrabal. The Moors and Christians coexisted here peacefully for centuries. You'll find ruins of the Moorish castle as well as the Iglesia Antigua de Calpe, the only remaining example of Mudejar-Gothic architecture in the region.

The beaches in Calpe are some of the best on the entire Costa Blanca. Soak up the sun on sandy shores surrounded by rugged cliffs. Windsurfing and jet skiing are popular pastimes at area beaches. La Fossa and Arenal have beautiful promenades. Les Bassetes is famous for its crystal waters and gorgeous seabed.

Calpe is the perfect spot from which to explore all of Costa Blanca and Valencia. Dénia offers beautiful beaches and ferries to Ibiza and Mallorca daily. Moraira, like Calpe, was a fishing village but has gone decidedly upscale and Altea is known for its whitewashed architecture and cobblestone streets. Javea has a large expat population so you'll feel right at home.

Explore centuries-old ruins or spend the day soaking up the rays on the gorgeous Mediterranean. Our Calpe holiday rentals make it all possible.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Javea/
Situated on the Costa Blanca, Jávea is one of the top destinations in the region. A picturesque 12-mile coastline abuts an old city with historic architecture and sites. Stay at one of our Jávea holiday rentals and you'll see why so many visitors are enthralled with this beautiful town.

The Visigoths put the town on the map, building a Christian monastery here in the sixth century. The monastery still stands as does the Church of San Bartolomé and castle ruins. Today, the town is a summer playground for Europeans due to its beautiful beaches and homes with wrought iron balconies. It's become so popular that half of the population is foreign born. Come and see why our Jávea holiday rentals are much sought after.

Situated at the foot of the Montgó Massif, Jávea is in the Costa Blanca region of Spain on the Mediterranean, just under 300 miles from Barcelona and only 180 miles from the Balearic Islands. The town is separated into three sections: The old town, port, and beach area.

Jávea plays host to several historic and cultural sites of note. The Soler Blasco Archaeological and Ethnographic Museum highlights the history of the town as well as numerous works of local artist J.B. Segarra Llamas. The Parroquia de San Bartolomé is a Gothic church built to defend the city against pirates. It also saw much bombardment during the Spanish Civil War. The Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Loreto, built in 1967, is an example of avant garde architecture and its 12 beams represent the apostles.

Like many other towns in the region, the old city is separated from the port and beaches by a one-mile expanse. This was done to deter raids on the town. The Jávea coastline is a separate entity from the old town and its 12-mile swath features numerous sandy beaches. El Arenal is one of the most iconic in town and you can enjoy water sports on the white sands of Granadella Cove.

The entire Costa Blanca region is synonymous with fun, sand, and sun, and a number of towns are within an easy drive of Jávea. Ten miles to the north lies the stunning town of Dénia, the capital of the Marina Alta region. Calpe and the Peñón de Ifach Nature Reserve are just 13 miles to the south. The upscale fishing village of Moraira is seven miles south and the whitewashed architecture and winding streets of Altea are 22 miles away.

A getaway at one of our Jávea holiday rentals will never be forgotten!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Moraira/
Once a quiet fishing village, Moraira has become one of the most exclusive resort towns in all of the Costa Blanca. Sandy beaches meet bustling promenades. Seaside cafes abut bountiful vineyards. Our Moraira holiday rentals offer the perfect refuge to enjoy all this coastal town has to offer.

Cave excavations unearthed objects belonging to prehistoric settlers. The Iberians made this there home soon after and then the Moors invaded in the seventh century, establishing irrigation systems and buildings that we still see today. Fishing was the occupation of choice for much of the residents until tourism took over post-Francisco Franco. Today, Moraira enjoys a reputation as an idyllic vacation spot for visitors with deep pockets. Stay at one of our Moraira holiday rentals to experience for yourself this beautiful town in Spain.

Situated on the Northern Costa Blanca, Moraira boasts more authentic Spanish charm than some of its trendier neighbors. Whitewashed villas look down on cobblestone streets. The Castillo de Moraira, built in 1742, provided protection from Barbary pirates and still features the seal of the Bourbon dynasty. Wear sturdy shoes as you climb to the top of Torre Vigia Cap d'Or, a watchtower that affords magnificent views of the town and its environs.

Most people who head here come for the beautiful beaches and small marina. The main beach, L'Ampolla, is sandy and busy come summer. With pine trees overlooking the bay, Playa del Portet offers turquoise water and L’Andragó, Punta Estrella, and La Cala all have clear water set in rocky coves.

A stay here wouldn't be complete without a visit to the Lonja, the daily fish auction held near the marina. Grab some fresh fish and bring it home to one of our Moraira holiday rentals for a delicious repast.

You'll find Moraria to be the perfect base from which to explore the rest of Costa Blanca and Valencia. Spend the day at the beach in Dénia and then hop on a ferry to Mallorca. Calpe was a fishing village but is now home to a wealth of beautiful sandy coves. Altea is known for its whitewashed architecture and cobblestone streets. Jávea has a large expat population so finding a meal like you'd get at home is easy as pie.

Soak in the sun and relax in a cozy cafe in Moraira. Our Moraira holiday rentals will take you there.

Ranging from vast tracks of well-kept forest and pristine beaches to laid-back towns with a Caribbean vibe, the province of Bocas del Toro is the coastal paradise that inlanders dream of! This Caribbean getaway in northern Panama is a lovely destination for a relaxed trip your loved ones.

Bocas del Toro is a unique landscape where island and mountains meet, creating diverse geography and breathtaking scenery. Most of Bocas del Toro's main land is home to La Amistad International Park, which meets the shores of the archipelago and extends out into several islands and keys. Bocas del Toro shares its border with the Limon Province of Costa Rica, the two Panama provinces of Chiriqui and Ngobe-Bugle Comarca, and - of course - the Gulf of Mexico.

The capital city of Bocas del Toro shares its same name (although it's also known as Bocas Town) and resides on the Isla Colon.

Between sparkling waters and sugar-sand beaches, towns of happy and accommodating locals, and a rich diversity of plants and wildlife, it's no wonder that this beautiful Panama province is known as the Galapagos of the Caribbean! It is largely considered to be one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on earth.

The diversity of Bocas del Toro extends not only to the flora and fauna, but also to the people who call this beautiful oasis home. Ranging from indigenous peoples to Latinos to beach-loving gringos, this Panama province is a place rich in diversity and difference. For example, right across the water from Bocas Town is the one of the larger islands of the archipelago, Isla Bastimentos. This beautiful island is home to the Isla Bastimentos National Marine Park, the Salt Creek indigenous community, and the Red Frog Beach vacation community.

Whether you're planning for a relaxing retreat or an exotic escape, you'll find just what you're looking for in this incredible province. Book your beach trip with Vacasa in Bocas del Toro today!

Vacasa is excited to announce that we will soon be offering vacation rentals in Lombardy! Learn more about the area, our property management services, view our Lombardy job openings, and please check back soon to book a Vacasa home here in Lombardy!

Where do you want to go?

Defined by its diversity from one border to another, Lombardy or Lombardia in Italian, is one of Italy's most influential areas. One of the most populated regions in the country, Lombary also has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites of any other Italian region which makes for an interesting combination of ancient history and modern conveniences. Many of our Lombardy vacation rentals are nestled among the beautiful landscape made up of mountains, lakes, hills, and plains.

Milan acts as the region's commercial epicenter and people-magnet, but there are still many incredible sights to see and locations to explore in this spectacular part of Italy. From the huge mountains in the north to the wine regions in the south, there's something for guests of all ages and interests.

Choose to stay in one of our Lombardy vacation rentals and you can spend your days devouring some risotto alla milanese, swimming in a sparkling clear blue lake, or examining a famous fresco.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Panama/Bocas-del-Toro/Bocas-del-Toro/
Laid-back and artsy during the day, vibrant and full of music by night, the city of Bocas del Toro (also called Bocas Town) is the hub of commerce and activity in the province of Bocas del Toro. Complete with Caribbean hospitality, access to delicious seafood, and sparkling beaches, our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals offer the perfect home base for your next adventure.

Whether you're looking for a relaxing retreat or an exotic escape, a stay in one of our Panama vacation rentals in Bocas del Toro is sure to be an island vacation that you'll remember for years to come.

Bocas del Toro is the capital city of the Bocas del Toro province, and sits on the southern node of Isla Colon, the largest and most populated island of the Bocas del Toro archipelago. While its closest neighbor is Isla Bastimentos, guests of our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals may easily access any of the surrounding islands, keys, and the mainland via water taxi or sail boat.

The city of Bocas del Toro is the epicenter of business for this province, but don't expect a busy and bustling city! This small, laid-back town has under 7,500 residents and no notable historical sites or museums. The cultural experience comes from interacting with the diverse locals who call this island town home.

A relaxing change of pace from what you'll find in larger places like Panama City, Bocas del Toro offers a variety of shops, dining, and tour companies, while maintaining a close-knit community feel. Enjoy a relaxed pace during the day while you wander down 1st, 2nd, and Main Street, poking about shops and admiring local goods and trinkets. Visit Simon Bolivar Park for a sampling of local cuisine, artisan crafts, and jewelry.

Take the opportunity to soak up some sun at one of the beaches on Isla Colon. Bocas del Drago is on the far side of the island and guests can reach it via bus or boat tour. This beach's mostly calm waters and sandy coral bottom make it great for snorkeling, while surfing is a must when the waves get a bit bigger! Grab lunch at Yarisnori Restaurant and then take a boat tour to Bird Island, a small outcropping off the shore where guests will enjoy watching for the red-billed tropicbird, one of Panama's rare, indigenous bird species.

Hike from Bocas del Drago to Starfish Beach, one of the only beaches in Bocas del Toro that is mostly protected from rough surf, making the water quite calm and clear. Bring snorkeling gear and get ready to check out starfish feeding. A family-friendly destination, Starfish Beach is also a wonderful spot to launch small water crafts like stand-up paddle boards and kayaks or to watch for sea turtles at night during their annual migration.

As the sun sinks and the boat tours start pulling back into their harbors, the cocktails start flowing and the music starts playing in the city of Bocas del Toro! A once sleepy town turns into a myriad of happy hour specials, live music, and scrumptious food as soon as 5 PM rolls around.

Take your bar-hop to the next level with visits to local hot spots like Barco Hundido, where guests can sip drinks out on the "wreck deck" or boogie it out on the dance floor to the beats of reggae, salsa, and merengue. Head to La Iguana, an over-the-water disco, or visit Aqua Lounge, an over-the-water bar with sea swings, sea trampolines, and some of the most exuberant parties on the island!

The archipelago is naturally designed so that guests can easily get around from island to island without too much difficulty and our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals are in the perfect locations to offer ample opportunities to explore other islands!

Isla Carenero, the closest island off the coast of Isla Colon, is a much sleepier town than Bocas del Toro. You'll find a few bed and breakfasts and a handful of seafood restaurants in Isla Carenero, including a restaurant/equipment rental called BiBi's on the Beach. After you've eaten your fill of fresh seafood (reputed to be the best in the province), rent a stand-up paddle board from BiBi's and make your way around the reefs of Carenero.

If you like surfing, Isla Carenero is the place for you - Carenero Point offers perfect tubes in the right conditions and the various waves offer water terrain for surfers of all levels - even beginners!

Whether you're here for the food, the music, the aquatic recreation, or naps on the beach, our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals keep you close to everything that this Caribbean oasis has to offer!

"We chose the name Vacasa because we felt it had the potential for international branding- the second part means 'home' in Spanish," says Johnson. "All around the world, people are starting to choose vacation rentals more and more, and we're excited to be a part of this rising global trend."

Placencia is a TripAdvisor-ranked top tourist destination, playing home to almost 200,000 annual visitors from the United States alone. Located in the Caribbean Sea, visitors come for the tropical climate and world class fishing, sailing, snorkeling, and national parks.

Vacasa will introduce its full range of marketing and rate optimization technologies to all of its new properties. This tech-based backing, combined with a local, hands-on approach to care taking, is Vacasa's guiding strategy that has allowed the company to achieve rapid growth and success since its founding in 2009.

"In the last year and a half, we've used that strategy to bring West Coast vacation rental homeowners onto a more level playing field with much larger industries like hotels and resorts," says Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "In Belize, these industries tend to be even more dominant, but we're up for the challenge and can't wait to offer the opportunity to homeowners and travelers in a new part of the world."

Vacasa's Vice President of Business Developement Yael Livneh will initially run operations in Belize to ensure a smooth and consistent transition.

"It was crucial that we had someone on the ground to make sure that our first international destination is a success," says Johnson, "and Yael isn't too disappointed to leave the rainy Portland winter for sunny shores!"

Johnson saw the opportunity to go international when Shaul Streifler of Berkshire Hathway Home Services and Koenig Rubloff International contacted him about a potential partnership to introduce US investors to real estate opportunities in Belize. They began talking, but it wasn't until the duo met Boris Mannsfeld that things started coming together. Mannsfeld has been in the real estate industry in Belize for more than 20 years and was able to introduce Vacasa to several developers in the Placencia market who were eager to bring guests and buyers to the area.

Next up? Johnson says expansion to other countries like Panama and Mexico are already in the works, and the company's leadership team has begun preliminary discussions with potential European partners as well.

VACASA ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF POINTE WEST PROPERTIES IN GALVESTON

Galveston, TX- Vacasa, the nation's fastest-growing travel startup, announced today that it has acquired Pointe West Properties in Galveston, a popular vacation island located in southern Texas. The addition of Pointe West Properties' 32 vacation rentals marks Vacasa's first step toward introducing its brand of full-service property management to vacation rental homeowners in Texas.

Vacasa Director of Acquisitions Amber Knight said she is eager to add Galveston to Vacasa's expanding portfolio of vacation destinations throughout the United States.

"Texas has a long and well-established history of vacation rentals, and we're excited to be bringing a fresh and innovative perspective to the area," Knight said. "Vacasa excels in maximizing bookings during traditionally slow seasons and we are looking forward to boosting revenue for homeowners and supporting and growing the local Gulf economy."

Pointe West Properties employees will continue providing hands-on care and support as they join Vacasa's team of more than 500 employees. Pointe West Properties owner Lyndsey Garza said she is confident this will ensure a smooth transition for homeowners and clientele.

"The Pointe West Properties team and I are very excited to join Vacasa. When seeing the opportunities available to a small niche vacation rental company, I was confident that Vacasa was the answer to my desire to grow my business yet still maintain our personalized approach to the vacation rental experience," Garza said. "Vacasa has implemented many of the procedures and processes we previously desired, but were unable to resource as a small company."

Set on 33 miles of Texas coastline, Pointe West Properties offers visitors a combination of houses and condos, many of which feature views of Galveston Bay. Past visitors have enjoyed the properties' proximity to the beach and other family attractions like Moody Gardens, Schlitterbahn Waterpark, and Pleasure Pier.

Since 2009, Vacasa has grown rapidly through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions of companies like Pointe West.

"In the last year and a half, we've been able to introduce technology like rate optimization algorithms that have brought West Coast vacation rental homeowners onto a more level playing field with much larger industries like hotels and resorts," says Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon, "We're looking forward to bringing that same opportunity to Pointe West Properties."

PORTLAND, OR- Vacasa, named Portland's fastest-growing privately-owned company by the Portland Business Journal in June and the nation's fastest-growing private company in the travel industry by Inc. Magazine in August, has announced plans for large-scale growth in 2015. The tech-focused vacation rental management and marketing firm is expanding both nationally and internationally, with plans to hire more than 6,000 employees to support its growth.

"Our homeowners love the combination of local, hands-on care taking and a more innovative, tech-focused support staff" says  Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "In the last year and a half, we've been able to introduce technology like revenue optimization algorithms and customized in-home automation that have brought West Coast vacation rental homeowners onto a more level playing field with much larger industries like hotels and resorts. We can't wait to offer that same opportunity to homeowners - and travelers - in the rest of the world."

In the U.S., Vacasa plans to add its first homes in popular East Coast and Gulf Coast vacation destinations, including Cape Cod and the Gulf Shores. In addition to eastward expansion, Vacasa will continue to expand its portfolio of western properties, developing its presence in existing states and branching into new ones.

Internationally, Vacasa plans to introduce its brand of full-service property management to homeowners in Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, and Europe. This includes specific plans for a European launch in Tuscany and the Amalfi Coast in Italy, as well as Barcelona and Costa del Sol in Spain. Additional international destinations include Santiago, Chile, Nicaragua, Panama, and Ecuador.

"We're incredibly excited about the future of our company, and of the vacation rental industry as a whole," says COO/Co-Founder Cliff Johnson. "Across the country - and the globe - more travelers are choosing the privacy and comfort of a vacation home rental instead of a hotel. Our team at Vacasa is uniquely positioned to handle this growing demand with a trusted brand and consistent experience."

To meet the demands of such rapid expansion, Vacasa intends to grow its workforce from almost 500 employees to nearly 7,000 by the end of 2015. Vacasa intends to focus heavily on technology, analytics, and marketing positions, including plans to bring on a Chief Technology Officer, Director of Engineering, developers, Analytics Director, analysts, Marketing Director, PR Director, operations coordinators, and sales coordinators.

With 500 of these new positions expected to be Portland-based, Vacasa recently doubled the footprint of its Northeast Portland headquarters on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to nearly 10,000 square feet of office space.

"We have begun to build an incredible tech team and support staff here in Portland," says Johnson, "and we're thrilled to be creating more jobs locally for talented Oregonians."

The remaining positions will be remotely-based property managers, sales staff, and housekeeping roles in new and emerging Vacasa destinations. Approximately 1,500 of these local positions will be filled in Oregon, Vacasa's first and most successful market.

PORTLAND, OR- This week Inc. Magazine named Vacasa the 9th fastest-growing private company in the US, and the fastest-growing in the entire Travel and Hospitality industry.

Vacasa was founded in Portland in 2009, and their North Portland headquarters is home to 42 employees. The company has a strong presence in destinations like Mt. Hood, the Oregon Coast, Central Oregon, and the Columbia Gorge, and has been working to bring legal vacation rentals to the city of Portland itself. In total, Vacasa has 419 employees, with plans to triple that workforce over the coming year.  The company is currently hiring for 83 roles. Specific opportunities can be found at vacasa.com/careers.

"We hire talented local people, and we support them with world-class technology, said CEO Eric Breon.  "Our system both streamlines the management of homes and optimizes financial results for homeowners. This has attracted over 1,100 homes to Vacasa, which gives us a fantastic selection of properties for guests to choose from."

In interviews, Breon's most common question is "If you could design your own job here, what would it be?"  With such rapid growth, Vacasa offers nearly unlimited opportunity for advancement, and is focused on creating the perfect role for every employee.  Vacasa's Vice President of Operations, Kimberly Stapleton, started as a housekeeper while in graduate school. Now, less than four years later, she leads Vacasa's housekeeping and maintenance organization, which includes over 300 employees, and continues to grow rapidly.

Vacasa's rapid growth was due, in part, to the housing downturn. "We manage vacation homes, and prior to the financial downturn, people were buying vacation homes as an investment, without plans to rent them, said CEO Eric Breon. When the downturn hit, prices fell 40 percent. Combined with property taxes, maintenance, and more, homeowners were much more eager to explore renting their second home. This timing helped us quickly become one of the largest vacation rental companies in the country, and we now have owners earning over $100,000 annually by renting their home for periods it previously sat empty."

Beyond the financial benefits, homeowners have come to value the services provided by Vacasa.  According to Tracey Baron, the owner of Great Blue Lodge on Mt. Hood and The Blue Pelican on the Oregon Coast, "Owning vacation homes is so much easier now that they are managed by Vacasa. I used to personally manage my vacation homes, and I would struggle to keep up with all of the deferred maintenance and management duties, but not anymore.  Now, when I visit my properties, the lights are on waiting for me, the grounds are in good condition, and everything works properly.  I reserve my family's stays through the online owner log-in, then simply show up and enjoy our properties. I also have the luxury of Vacasa's housekeepers to clean when we leave if we don't want to do it ourselves.  My relationship with Vacasa has freed up a tremendous amount of my time and increased my revenue, which has allowed me to acquire additional properties and spend more time with my family. I trust in Vacasa to properly manage my vacation properties, and at the end of the day, that is what allows me to sleep at night."

On the other end of the spectrum, the financial performance offered by Vacasa has attracted savvy investors to the vacation rental space. Tony Hauser, a successful entrepreneur and real estate investor, recently purchased a nine-bedroom oceanfront home in Newport, OR specifically for Vacasa to manage. According to Hauser, "Vacasa has totally changed the dynamics of investing in vacation-oriented real estate. Thanks to Vacasa, I'm able to realize 7% cash return on this investment, along with the appreciation associated with oceanfront property and two weeks per year of tax-free use for my family." Hauser also reported that since his initial investment in his Newport home, he has purchased three more condos on the Oregon Coast and is in the market for additional properties.

Many of the homes Vacasa manages were previously managed "by owner", and advertised on sites like VRBO, Airbnb, and similar listing services.  "With our marketing and rate optimization technology, homeowners can earn considerably more from their homes, with us doing all of the work," said Breon.  "We guarantee homeowners that currently 'rent by owner' that they'll earn more with Vacasa, even after our fees, or we will refund the difference. We also offer a fixed rent option, in which we pay homeowners a set monthly amount, without any risk or seasonality."

A key driver of Vacasa's exceptional results is their revenue optimization system. "Our revenue optimization system is similar to those employed by airlines to maximized both revenue and occupancy on every flight," said Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "We use several hundred variables to set the optimal price for every night, at every home.  This approach increases revenue by over 30% versus homes that use more basic revenue management techniques, like simply relying on peak and off-season prices."

While primarily designed to benefit homeowners, Vacasa's revenue optimization system also creates discounts and last-minute savings for guests.  According to Scott Breon, "If the ski forecast isn't looking good for the coming weekend, our system will automatically discount last minute rates, so those people still planning a weekend trip can get a great deal."

When asked the secret of their success, Eric Breon said, "At Vacasa, we take an inherently local business - vacation rental property management - and do it over a wide geographic area.  Building the systems that make this possible was a big investment, but this gives us economies of scale not otherwise found in our industry."

Vacasa believes their greatest growth is still in the future. According to COO Cliff Johnson, "Over the past few years, we've been figuring out what it takes to do growth right, and we now have it down to a science. We're launching in 15 new markets on September 1st, and we plan to continue accelerating our pace of growth."

WALDPORT, OR-  -- On July 17th, Vacasa , the nation's second-largest vacation rental company, began managing the historic Cape Code Cottages  in Waldport. Long-time guests and new visitors alike filled Cape Cod Cottages to near-maximum capacity during Vacasa's opening management weekend.

"The Cape Cod Cottages are a landmark in Waldport, and it is exciting to see the parking lot full once again and lots of activity on the beach," Vacasa Regional Director Donna Rudd said.

First rented in 1938, Cape Cod Cottages overlooks a scenic stretch of shoreline along Big Stump Beach. The cottages include 10 fully-furnished units with small kitchenettes and two upper-level studio units. Vacasa plans to transform the former caretakers' accommodations into a premier rental, and has made initial property improvements including upgrading the complementary Wi-Fi access and welcoming travelers with dogs to the cottages for the first time.

"This five-acre oceanfront property is perfect for families or couples looking for reasonably priced accommodations, great views, and is centrally located for exploring all the Central Oregon Coast has to offer," Rudd said. "The upcoming planned renovations will make this wonderful property even better- these are exciting times for Cape Cod Cottages."

BRIAN HEAD, UT - Vacasa , the nation's second largest vacation rental management company, is expanding its presence in Utah by partnering with local firm Brian Head Vacation Rentals. The partnership adds approximately 40 ski condos and cabins to Vacasa's portfolio of privately-owned, professionally-managed vacation homes.

Vacasa Director of Acquisitions Amber Knight said she is excited about Brian Head's potential as a vacation destination due to its proximity to five national parks, and its reputation as a low-cost alternative to Park City.

"We are looking forward to including Brian Head as we expand our successful marketing efforts to reach potential guests visiting Utah not only for the ski season, but off-season and summer visits as well," Knight said.

Brian Head Vacation Rentals co-owners Aaron and Emily Bradley will continue providing hands-on care and support, which they believe will help make the transition smooth for their property owners and clientele.

"This partnership offers our owners opportunities for growth that we're very excited about," said Emily Bradley. "Vacasa is able to invest resources in technology, support staff, and employee benefits that make the partnership incredibly appealing. Our team is looking forward to becoming part of the Vacasa family!"

Vacasa has grown rapidly since entering the Utah vacation rental market earlier this year. Since acquiring Utah Vacation Homes in April and Park City Resort Properties in August, Vacasa now manages about 120 vacation rentals in Utah, in a variety of destinations including Salt Lake City, Cottonwood Heights, Park City and Brighton.

PORTLAND, OR- Nathan Rojas, a veteran of the United States Marines, is the recipient of a Veterans Day giveaway sponsored by Vacasa and the USO Northwest.

In honor of the holiday and all veterans who have served their country, our Portland-based vacation rental management company partnered with the USO Northwest to present a complimentary two-night stay in one of our oceanfront Oregon Coast rental properties. USO Northwest staff conducted the giveaway by asking Oregon veterans to share a meaningful story from their time of service.

The USO team selected Nathan Rojas as the recipient of the complimentary stay at the Oregon Coast, and we're privileged to be able to provide his family with a greatly-deserved getaway together. Here is Nathan's story:

"My name is Nathan Rojas, and I am a United States Marine. It has not been an easy journey but it is one that I am proud of. My experiences have ranged from scary, exciting, happy, sad, stressful, and most of all, rewarding. I would have to say, the one thing I will never forget occurred during my second deployment. My company was stationed in Afghanistan, and I couldn't have been more anxious and happy to be with my marines. Although, there was one thing I could not shake off no matter how how I tried; my pregnant wife.

We found out that we were going to be parents in August of 2011 and I was ecstatic - I was going to become a father for the first time. Soon after all of the excitement hit us, I quickly became upset; I was going to deploy four months later and I knew it. I realized I would not be home for the birth of my child.

However, I was grateful to find out that I was having a little girl, in the very last ultrasound I was allowed to see in person. The moment arrived when I had to leave my wife and my unborn daughter. I would dream about coming home and seeing my daughter every minute of the day.

Then the inevitable happened and we lost our first Marine, Paul. That is around the time it hit me that meeting my daughter was only just a dream at that point. It was not set in stone that I would ever meet her or that she would ever know about me. Each day that passed, I'd wonder if that would be my last day alive. Four more of my marines were killed as the months went on and I felt that it would soon be my time; meeting my baby girl seemed too good to be true.

I still prayed to God for a sign or to be able to see my daughter's face, even if through a photo. One day, we were allowed some down time and headed to the closest base to us, they had computers with internet access but I decided to shower and eat first and let my marines contact their families first. My friend Rick came running to me saying his girlfriend got in touch with my wife and she was in the hospital, in labor.

I immediately got on and emailed her. The hospital had a very strict policy on filming or webcams during childbirth or any medical procedures, so I knew I'd have to shut my computer off as soon as the baby would be delivered. It's sad to say I was no longer optimistic about much. I watched my friends get shot and injured in ways that I never thought possible and I lost men. Men whom, like me, had pregnant wives at home.

Then the unthinkable happened; my wife's doctor broke the rules and allowed me to stay on Skype long enough to watch my baby girl, Eva Abigail Rojas, come into the world. Words can not express how grateful I felt in that moment. I was blessed to see her first breath and to hear her first cries. It was magical and a true miracle.

Fast forward to six weeks later and I was finally on an airplane flying home! The moment finally came where I would meet my baby girl. I spotted my wife as soon as my bus pulled into the lot, she was holding a baby wrapped in a pink blanket and I just knew I was about to fall in love.

My wife had no idea I was standing behind her; I snuck up and gave her a kiss on the cheek and watched as she turned around and hugged me. She was so excited to introduce me to my daughter.

The moment I held my beautiful baby in my arms, I knew it was meant to be. I never thought I would ever see this day and here it was, so surreal, so rewarding and so magical. I sometimes wish I could have deployed at a different time, but then I think about how blessed I was, and that if anything would have been different, I may not have been so lucky.

My daughter is three years old now and she loves me more than I could ever know and I love her more than she could ever know. I never knew what true sacrifice was until that year and I would gladly do it all over again for my country and my family. This is my journey and it is one I am eternally grateful for and proud of."

We would like to thank Nathan and every veteran who shared their story with the USO team - but especially, thank you for your service, every day of the year.

PORTLAND, OR - Portland-based property management firm  Vacasa has announced the release of their Smart Home system, designed in-house to specifically target the unique needs of vacation rental homes. With this industry-leading system, the company gains the capability to remotely manage thermostats and lighting in its portfolio of vacation rental homes, greatly improving the efficiency of each property.

The proprietary system was designed by Erik Tylek Kettenburg, Vacasa's own Chief Technology Officer.

"The Vacasa Smart Home platform is the most advanced management system of its kind in the vacation rental industry," said Kettenburg. "The brains of the system is the Vacasa Smart Home Gateway - it communicates via a special router over secure wireless signals with the other devices within the home, and was designed in-house to provide a reliable solution customized to the unique needs of vacation rentals."

With the new technology, Vacasa homes will be able to utilize electronic thermostats and smart locks compatible with the Smart Home system. The thermostats will allow employees to monitor home temperatures and energy usage. Homes can be set to a comfortable temperature prior to a guest's arrival, but returned to a setting for minimal energy when unoccupied. Not only will this reduce unnecessarily heating or cooling empty homes, but save on energy costs of employees physically traveling to homes to adjust heating or monitor thermostats during inclement weather. Employee travel will also be reduced thanks to the homes' smart locks, which offer unique codes for every guest that can be reset and unlocked remotely.

In the near future, Vacasa plans to add smart light switches to the system, allowing lights to be controlled remotely. With over 1,000 homes under their management, Vacasa estimates the new Smart Home system could save owners $1,000 in energy costs annually.

The Smart Home system is the most recent step in Vacasa's efforts to reduce their carbon footprint - the company's prior initiatives include providing in-house recycling whenever possible and ordering sustainable products, from eco-friendly toiletries and cleaning supplies to LED light bulbs.

"We've always been committed to keeping our homes as efficient as possible," Vacasa's Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon said. "And the Smart Home system significantly extends those possibilities!"

YACHATS, OR- Vacasa, the nation's second-largest vacation rental company, has taken over management of the iconic Ocean Cove Inn in Yachats. The inn's nine rooms all include ocean views and small kitchenettes, and the property is located within walking distance of downtown Yachats' shopping and dining district.

The Ocean Cove Inn has received five-star ratings from TripAdvisor over the last two years, and the   Portland-based management firm has already completed several updates to the inn. Vacasa has transformed the former caretakers' quarters into the property's premier guest rental, upgraded the   complimentary high-speed Internet access, and begun welcoming travelers with dogs to the Ocean Cove Inn for the first time.

"The Ocean Cove Inn is such a charming boutique motel, and has a fantastic reputation in Yachats," said Vacasa Regional Director Donna Rudd. "Our team is honored to have the opportunity to carry that tradition forward."

Vacasa now manages more than 430 rental properties along the Oregon Coast, with a handful of inns and   motels complementing its portfolio of privately-owned, single-family vacation homes.

"A boutique motel appeals to guests who are just looking for a quick one-night stay, or might not need as   much as space as a private rental home," said Rudd. "We're looking forward to being able to meet those   travelers' needs as well, while still providing the exemplary customer service that has helped Vacasa   become so popular with visitors to the Oregon Coast."

Interested guests can visit VacasaRentals.com/usa/Ocean-Cove-Inn for details and online booking.

PORTLAND, OR- Vacasa was named the fastest-growing private company in the Portland region by the Portland Business Journal on Thursday, June 12th. The vacation rental management company earned the first-place ranking on a list of 100 companies due to their three-year revenue growth percentage - which the PBJ described on their website as an "almost-comical" 3,000-plus percent.

"It is a great honor to receive this award, and very humbling to be among the great companies that made this list," said Cliff Johnson, Vacasa's Chief Operating Officer. "We are planning to continue our growth by three to four times annually... so we hope to be back year after year!"

Since the company's founding in 2009, Vacasa has increased their portfolio of vacation homes to more than 1,000 rentals located throughout seven states: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, California, and Hawaii. Their staff, which began with Johnson and CEO Eric Breon, has grown to include more than 300 employees, including 209 in Oregon alone.

"It takes a great team to make a company grow like this, and we have been very fortunate to add exceptional employees at every phase of our growth plan," said Johnson. "We are always looking for ways to improve, and the best way we've done that is by adding new employees with expertise in perceived areas of weaknesses."

In 2014, Vacasa plans to add several hundred more rentals - both by signing individual owners and by focusing on acquisitions. The company also foresees hiring nearly 1,000 additional employees over the next year, with approximately 25% of those positions being located in Oregon.

"We don't foresee our growth slowing down anytime soon," said Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "And it's not just about hiring more employees; we really pride ourselves on providing significant advancement opportunities to the talented individuals already on our staff."

The vacation rental industry itself is one of the fastest-growing segments of the travel sector, and Vacasa entered the market just before the economic downturn of 2009 prompted many second home owners to explore renting their properties to paying guests. Vacasa's motto is "vacation rentals made easy", and the company provides full-service property management for hundreds of homeowners, including advertising, housekeeping, reservations, and maintenance. For guests, the company emphasizes online reservations and automated check-in services to make staying in a vacation home as simple and straightforward as a traditional hotel.

PORTLAND, OR- Over the next two months, Portland-based vacation rental management firm Vacasa plans to hire more than 50 new employees throughout the state of Oregon.

While some of the new employees joining the IT staff and marketing team will work out of Portland's newly expanded office in Northeast Portland, many of Vacasa's new hires will not be Portland-based. As the company predicts record occupancy rates this summer in the nearly 400 vacation homes they manage on the Oregon Coast, they face the same dilemma as many tourism-based businesses: seasonal fluctuations require lots of housekeepers in the summer and over holidays, but far fewer in the spring and fall.

"Traditionally, many companies within the vacation rental industry are forced to simply lay off the bulk of their workforce for the majority of the year," says Vacasa CEO Eric Breon. "We're determined to avoid that. We want to provide consistent work, and a modern work environment, for all of our employees not just the ones in management roles."

As Vacasa has grown (the five-year-old company now employs 275 people to care for over 900 homes across six states), they have prioritized hiring housekeepers, maintenance staff, and reservationists who are motivated toward internal growth.

"Part of our staffing strategy is to have a core team of hybrid employees who are qualified to fill many roles and able to work full-time instead of seasonal part-time positions," says Breon. "Reservations, housekeeping, maintenance and care of our homes, and even sales-focused roles can all fluctuate depending on the time of year. And during our busiest times, we can supplement our core team with college students and other employees who specifically seek out seasonal work."

Vacasa also places a premium on creating a modern, flexible workplace. Almost all employees, including housekeepers, are provided smartphones with internal apps to make scheduling and communicating in the field as easy as possible. Telecommuting and flexible scheduling is also encouraged among employees who work out of Vacasa's offices in Portland and Boise, and all employees are immediately eligible for 401k matches. Additionally, the company places a large emphasis on internal growth.

"We've had many employees who have started as housekeepers or interns, and moved into management positions," Vacasa co-founder and COO Cliff Johnson says. "The very first housekeeper we hired has moved up so much that she recently became the head of our entire operations team - she was managing a team of more than 30 employees and contractors and coordinating all of our maintenance for our entire portfolio of homes."

Vacasa's current hiring needs range from web developers and analysts to office assistants, housekeepers, and reservations agents. Interested parties should visit the company's website at vacasa.com/careers for current openings and online applications.

BOISE, ID- Portland-based vacation rental management firm Vacasa Rentals recently acquired Utah Vacation Homes, marking Vacasa's expansion into its seventh state in the Western US. With the addition of Utah Vacation Homes' 56 properties, located throughout Park City and Salt Lake City, Vacasa's portfolio will number over 900 privately-owned vacation homes.

Utah Vacation Homes' employees, including Vacation Rental Managers Association Board of Directors member Tristan Webb, will be retained and added to Vacasa's roster of over 200 employees.

"We're excited to be working in a world-class destination like Park City," said Vacasa's founder and CEO Eric Breon. "And we know that Tristan brings a passion and vision for the entire vacation rental industry along with his years of experience. We're looking forward to growing together as we bring the Vacasa brand both to current UVH owners, and as we expand throughout Utah."

The UVH acquisition occurred as a result of Vacasa's straightforward approach when exploring new markets: the company makes a habit of reaching out to existing companies or rental agents that might be interested in business partnerships with a larger brand.

"The Utah Vacation Homes team and I are very excited to join the Vacasa team," said Webb. "Vacasa has implemented many of the procedures and processes we previously desired, but were unable to resource as a small company. I am excited to be part of the most technologically sophisticated company in the vacation rental industry."

Vacasa also manages homes in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Idaho, California, and Hawaii. The company, which was founded in 2009, is focused on further expansion into Southern California as well as Utah.

"While we've grown very quickly, we've been able to sustain our success because we invest in marketing and rate optimization, so we can earn our owners higher rental income on more bookings," said Breon. "And while Park City is primarily a ski market, I feel confident that we can show the newest homeowners in the Vacasa family just how well we can book out the summer as well."
