#Pathname:/faq/
Q: How old do I need to be to reserve a home?

A: In order to reserve one of our vacation homes everyone who is traveling must be at least 21 years old or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. In some areas, the age requirement may be higher. Please give us a call at 503-345-9399 for more information.

Q: Do infants count toward the maximum occupancy?

A: Generally, children under the age of 2 do not count toward the maximum occupancy.

Q: Can I bring my dog along?

A: Dogs are allowed in many of our homes. Prior to bringing your dog, you must check with Vacasa and pay the required nightly pet fee.

Q: What is the difference between FlipKey/VRBO and your site?

A: VRBO/FlipKey/HomeAway are advertising sites. We are the property management company that manages everything from marketing to maintenance and housekeeping. We advertise on VRBO and other sites to get our homes the most visibility.

Q: Can I bring more people than the maximum allowed listed?

A: Maximum occupancy does not only refer to the number a home can sleep, this is also the number of people allowed in the home at any given time. It is determined by the licensing authority based on the number of exits in the home and fire safety evacuation plan. Some counties or HOA's have codes that are strictly enforced. Please abide by the maximum occupancy number for the home at all times.

Q: What does Trip Protection cover? Is there a time-frame as to when I can add trip protection?

A: If Trip Protection is purchased, you will receive a full refund for any nights of your reservation cancelled due to a death in the family, illness, flight delays, flight cancellations, or road closures due to bad weather. You can add Trip Protection up to 30 days prior to your reservation. If you are booking and your check-in date is already within 30 days into your reservation, Trip Protection may only be added within 24 hours from the time of booking.

Q: I tried to book a reservation online but it gave me an error. How do I know my reservation is secured?

A: When booking online, if you hit the submit button more than once this will result in you receiving an error message that says either your dates are unavailable or that you already have a reservation. Typically the reservation goes through, but you are welcome to call us at 503-345-9399 to confirm.

Q: Can I get a breakdown of the total cost?

A: The rental quote includes all lodging, taxes, and fees. The breakdown of the total cost is in the green box on the website if you book the reservation online at vacasa.com. Simply click the green box to get the breakdown.

Q: What is Vacasa's cancellation policy?

A: You may cancel within the first 24 hours of booking the reservation with a full refund. Rental payments (less a 5% processing fee) are refundable up until 30 days prior to the reservation. We are unable to offer refunds on reservations cancelled within 30 days of the check-in date unless you purchase our optional Trip Protection plan and the reason for cancellation falls within the trip protection guidelines.

Q: What is the pet policy?

A: Pets are permitted in selected homes, depending on owner preferences. Some owners may have pet allergies and we ask that you only bring your pets into pet-friendly homes. The standard fee is $10 per pet, per night, with a minimum rate of $40 per reservation. The pet maximum and fee may vary by unit and will be listed on the home's webpage.

Q: Do you have any homes without a two night minimum stay?

A: Most of our homes have at least a two night minimum stay. We do have some condos and studios that allow for a one night stay and they should appear when searching for your dates.

Q: Do you take partial payments or must I pay in full upon booking?

A: All reservations under $2000 must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 but within 60 days of check-in must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 with partial payments and more than 60 days out must be paid in full 30 days before the start date of the reservation.

Q: Do you allow weddings in your homes?

A: Some of our homes do allow weddings with the owner's approval. Depending on the home, there may be additional fees, parking restrictions and guest count maximums. Please call us at 503-345-9399 for more details.

Q: How can I modify my reservation, and are there any fees associated with that?

A: Please call us at 503-345-9399 to help you modify your reservation. There could be additional fees depending on the change occurring, but we will walk you through everything before finalizing it.

Q: Do you have monthly rates for your homes?

A: The maximum number of nights one of our homes can be booked for is 29. Therefore, we do not offer monthly rates. The rates for our homes vary based on day of the week, local events, and season.

Q: I found a better unit than the one I booked, would I be able to modify my reservation and change it to the new unit?

A: It is possible to switch homes as long as the change is made more than 30 days prior to the reservation. If the modification results in a higher rental rate guests are responsible for paying the difference. Reservations can be modified without penalty up to 24 hours from making the reservation.

Q: Would I need to sign a rental contract for renting a vacation rental?

A: By booking a reservation, guests acknowledge and agree to abide by Vacasa's rental policies. Some of our homes will require you to sign a reservation contract agreeing to policies that are specific to that home. We ask that you review and sign the contract and return it to us via email or fax.

Q: How do I go about booking a vacation as a gift for a friend?

A: You can book and pay for a reservation for another person. However, you must ensure that the name and all contact information listed on the reservation, including the email address, are for the person that will be staying in the home.

Q: What is the difference between a hotel and a vacation rental?

A: All of our vacation rentals are owned by private home-owners and can be preferable to hotels for a number of reasons. They are typically more comfortable, offer kitchens for preparing meals and are more accommodating to those traveling with children and/or pets. Vacation rentals also offer a wider variety of accommodations which enables them to fit any vacation need, be that a mountain home for 25 or a beach cottage for 2.

Q: How do I pay for a reservation?

A: We accept the following credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express. We also accept electronic checks for reservations booked more than 30 days in advance.

Q: Is smoking allowed in the home?

A: Smoking is prohibited on the rented premises.

Q: Does the home come with linens and towels, or do I need to bring my own?

A: The home will be equipped with all the basic necessities. All the beds will be made with fresh linens and bath towels will be provided. If you would like beach towels, we recommend bringing those with you.

Q: What items can I expect to find in the home?

A: Please see the features and amenities section of the home listing. Vacasa also provides a few items to get you started, including: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, and small trash can liners. If there is something specific that you require, please make sure you bring it with you.

Q: What cable package does the home have? Will we be able to watch the game?

A: Rental properties are individually owned and each home will have a different cable vs streaming option. Vacasa cannot guarantee Television service or TV Channel availability.

Q: If I want to order the UFC Fight, a movie, or a game can I do so and have it charged to my credit card on file?

A: Our homes generally do not provide any sort of pay-per-view service.

Q: How do I obtain the keys?

A: We will e-mail check-in instructions 7 days prior to your stay including driving directions and the code to the lock box or electronic deadbolt.

Q: The lockbox only has one set of keys. Can we get another set?

A: We prefer the keys stay in the lockbox so that each member of your party can access the home at any time. This will eliminate the need for multiple key sets. It also prevents the keys from getting lost.

Q: There are two lockboxes here. Am I using the right one?

A: The lockbox closest to the door or on top is usually the guest lockbox. The other one is for our cleaning and maintenance staff. Occasionally the plates get swapped. If you are having trouble getting in using the code, try it on the other lockbox.

Q: Can I not pay the cleaning fee if I clean the home myself, rather than using your cleaning services?

A: No. Guests are not allowed to clean after their own stay. Our housekeepers meet very strict guidelines and are required to clean the home after each guest vacates.

Q: We've run out of toilet paper. Can you bring us some more?

A: Vacasa provides a starter kit of supplies only. If you think you will need more than what is provided, please make sure to bring some with you.

Q: We can't find any paper towels or dishwashing detergent. Can you bring us some?

A: Please check in all cabinets (under the sink, above the refrigerator) and if you cannot find what you are looking for, we will gladly reimburse you for picking some up. The same goes for the following items: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, small trash can liners, and propane for the grill.

Q: We can't get the fireplace/internet/hot tub/etc. working. Are there instructions in the house?

A: You should have received an email from us with check-in instructions that includes a link to a digital guest binder. With your reservation number, you will have access to all your house instructions. However, if no instructions are found or if you need further assistance please contact one of our Customer Service Agents at 503-345-9399.

Q: I am allergic to pet dander and other smells, but I want to stay in a pet friendly home. Is there any way to ensure that I won't be bothered by them for my stay?

A: All our homes are thoroughly cleaned after each stay. However, we are unable to guarantee that you will not have a reaction to a home that has been regularly occupied by pets.

Q: What are the check-out procedures?

A: Check-out is at 11AM and upon your departure we ask that you start the first load of laundry if there is a washer and dryer in the home. If you have time to begin a second load it is greatly appreciated by our housekeeping staff. A $75 per hour fee will be assessed for failing to vacate the unit by the agreed upon check-out time.

Q: Do I have to check in by a certain time?

A: Check-in is at 4 PM and guests can arrive any time after. There are some cases when early check-in is available. If that is the case, we will email you the morning of your stay to inform you that an early check-in option is available. Please note that we will not be able to confirm or deny an early check in request prior to the day of check in due to our cleaning schedules.

Q: Do you allow early check-ins?

A: An early check-in is dependent on whether or not the housekeeper has time to fully clean the home before your arrival. If guests are checking out the same day that your reservation begins, an early check-in is not allowed as it will not allow the housekeeper enough time to fully prepare the home for you. We will email you the morning of your check-in if early check-in is available.

Q: Can I get a late check out?

A: Late check-out is available if we do not have another reservation that night. There is a fee (plus taxes) associated. The fee varies from house to house. We can tell you if a late check-out is available three days before check-in. If you pay for late check-out you will have the home until midnight the day you check-out.

Q: What is your lost and found policy?

A: We will return your lost item to you if you call us within two weeks of your departure date. We do charge a $25 fee, plus shipping to cover the cost of labor, drive time, and postal fees. Any items not claimed within two weeks will be donated to a local charity.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

From a cozy cabin near the slopes to a nestled-in-the-woods golfside condo, a Mt. Hood vacation rental is the key to a getaway full of uniquely Oregon sights, sounds, tastes, and fun. Including the highest point in the state of Oregon, the Mt. Hood region is a treasure trove of year-round outdoor activities, like skiing, fishing, hiking, and much more.

Starting about 30 miles east of bustling Portland, this region includes the Mt. Hood National Forest, with its Douglas Fir-covered landscape. The Cascade Mountain Range fills out the landscape here, with Mt. Hood being the tallest peak with a height nearing 11,240 feet.

Leaving the Columbia River corridor along the northern Oregon border and heading south on Highway 35 from Hood River, the charming town of Parkdale sits in the midst of the fertile vineyards and orchards of the Hood River Valley. This is also the highway that leads up the northern face of Mt. Hood, so amazing views of its snow-capped peak abound.

Speaking of snow - let's talk about serious skiing! Once you've reached the peak of Mt. Hood, the closest town is the charming alpine village of Government Camp, home to not two but three ski resorts: Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood Skibowl, and Mount Hood Meadows. All are quite popular, but Timberline is perhaps the most famous. Built in the 1930s, its iconic lodge has been used as a location for a number of films including Bend of the River, Lost Horizon, and The Shining. One of the most desirable locations on Mt. Hood, Government Camp is full of convenient ski condos and cozy cabins for travelers who want to stay as close to the slopes as possible!

Highway 26 leads back down the western side of the mountain, and is dotted with charming villages full of riverside cabins and rustic retreats. Nine miles from Government Camp, the outdoor paradise of Rhododendron lies close to five state parks and boasts hiking, boating, rafting, climbing, horseback riding, fishing, and more in the summer. Birding enthusiasts can explore two official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails, while using binoculars, cameras, and sketchbooks to capture scenes of their feathered friends.

Two miles further west, the small, unincorporated village of Zig Zag is a perfect family getaway full of non-stop outdoor adventure, including quiet hikes along the nearby ZigZag River.

A bit of advice - when you come to visit ZigZag's comparatively bustling neighbor, Welches, be sure to bring your clubs! For an amazing golf getaway, you could not pick a better spot, as there are no less than three golf courses in the area. The first course, founded in 1928, was actually the very initial one in Oregon. And if you're up for the challenge of catching your dinner, head to the aptly named Salmon River and spend a sunny afternoon fishing for salmon and steelhead. Like all towns near Mt. Hood, Welches offers many cold weather activities as well, be it a sleigh ride around snowy downtown or just enjoying a cup of hot cocoa back at your cozy condo.

Outdoor enthusiasts will also adore staying in quiet Brightwood, located near the meeting of the Sandy and Salmon Rivers. This little village is a cyclist's dream with 17 bike trails, rated from strenuous to fun-for-everyone. With two rivers winding through town, fishing is also huge here, so make sure to bring your gear or just head to the small downtown's fishing supply store.

Our final destination in this richly diverse region is Molalla, a less popular - and thus less crowded - destination tucked southwest of Mt. Hood along the scenic Molalla River Corridor. In addition to river-related activities like rafting and fishing, this city is also known for its famed "Buckeroo Rodeo", showing off equestrian skills beginning in April and ending in September.

It may be hard to find a more diverse and quintessentially Pacific Northwest region than this one. Book a Mt. Hood vacation rental to discover everything this area has to offer!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Mendocino/
The villages, vineyards, and stunning natural beauty of the Mendocino Coast - or just "the Coast," as locals prefer - make this oceanfront slice of California an unforgettable destination for a laid-back adventure. Mendocino vacation rentals offer you a comfortable and cozy homebase for exploring one of the most remarkable locations on the West Coast.

Three hours north of San Francisco (and just shy of five hours from the Oregon border), you'll find a secluded, arts-minded paradise nestled between old-growth redwood forests and the churning waves of the Pacific Ocean... and there's no better way to experience this region than by living like a local in one of our Mendocino vacation rentals.

The village of Mendocino itself, once a logging boomtown, is now a little quieter and laid-back, with around 1,000 full-time residents. Thanks to the visiting tourists who arrive from the Bay Area on summer weekends, however, you'll find some truly wonderful restaurants, shops, and galleries to keep you entertained throughout your stay. Stop by Patterson's Pub for a pint of local beer and a bowl of clam chowder, or stock up on picnic supplies at Mendocino Market and head for the beach.

The entire coastline around the village is comprised of Mendocino Headlands State Park - the perfect spot for picnics, as well as hiking, beach combing, or simply soaking up the views of the rugged coastline and crashing waves. To get a little closer to the scenic wilderness, pay a visit to the knowledgable folks at Catch a Canoe & Bicycles Too to rent kayak, canoe, or bike for the day. The Big River, which empties into Mendocino Bay just south of town, is ideal for an afternoon of paddling - and Catch a Canoe even specializes in dog-friendly canoes so you can bring your four-legged best friend along for the ride!

The region surrounding Mendocino is full of fodder for excellent day trips. Head south to tiny Elk, California for breakfast the legendary Queenie's Roadhouse Cafe, or stop in Albion for a romantic oceanfront dinner at the Ledford House. Head out for a hike along the gorgeous, redwood-lined Navarro River. Or, drive north along Highway 1, stopping by the beautiful Point Cabrillo lighthouse on the way to funky Fort Bragg.

However you choose to spend your time in Mendocino, it's guaranteed to deliver that unmistakable Northern California sense of laid-back beauty. And Vacasa has the perfect Mendocino lodging in store, from dog-friendly beach houses to luxury country estates. Book one of our Mendocino vacation rentals today, and get your adventure started!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sunriver/
Sunriver is a unique Central Oregon destination that truly offers something for everyone. The family-friendly vacation community boasts world-class golf courses, miles of paved biking trails, a state-of-the-art aquatic center, and shopping & dining in the charming Village at Sunriver. Find your perfect Sunriver vacation rental from our collection of comfortable homes, cozy cabins, and executive retreats. Within half an hour, you can ski on Mt. Bachelor or brewery-hop in Bend; yet, this quiet resort town offers a wonderful sense of peace and relaxation with plenty of on-site amenities to keep everyone entertained. The Village includes rental outfitters and guide outposts where you can book fly fishing expeditions, guided horseback tours, ski lessons, snowshoe trips, and kayaking excursions. After you swim, fish, or shoot the rapids in nearby Deschutes River, you've only begun to experience what Sunriver has to offer. Try your swing on the links at one of the four golf courses in Sunriver: Meadows, Woodlands, Crosswater, and Caldera Springs. Some of our Sunriver houses and condos look right out over the green! There are two public parks for barbecues, softball, basketball, tennis, volleyball and horseshoes. Grab your bike, and head out on the 33 miles of paved paths that criss-cross the resort and connect you to the Village's shops, restaurants, and seasonal ice-skating rink. Sunriver's newest attraction is SHARC, a fully outfitted aquatic center with swimming pools, a lazy river, and hot tubs. With very few exceptions, all of our Vacasa homes offer complimentary passes to SHARC with your reservation! Whether you're seeking an outdoor adventure or a relaxing weekend curled up with a good book by the fireplace, there are a wide range of Sunriver vacation rentals to choose from, ensuring that you and your family will feel right at home during your Sunriver getaway!
#Pathname:/usa/Utah/Park-City/
Between top-notch skiing, the star-studded Sundance Film Festival, and year-round natural splendor, you'll find that a getaway to one of our Park City vacation rentals guarantees to be an unbelievable adventure! Surrounded by fantastic ski resorts like Park City Mountain Resort, Deer Valley, and The Canyons, and home to world-class dining and shopping, there's something special for everyone to enjoy in this beautiful Utah resort town, and our rentals located in places like Bear Hollow keep you close to the action and surrounded by Northern Utah's impressive landscape. Thanks to its early days as a silver mining boomtown, Park City is full of wonderful Victorian mansions, homes, shops, and hotels - many restored to peak condition after skiers discovered Park City's powder in the 1950s. Since then, Park City has become a world-renowned destination for winter adventures, even hosting many Olympic events during the Salt Lake City games in 2002. There's much more to Park City than its slopes, though. With over 400 miles of wooded trails for hiking and mountain biking, Park City keeps outdoor lovers busy all year. Head out of town just 20 minutes and spend the day at Jordanelle Reservoir. Culturephiles will adore attending annual festivals celebrating food, music, and art, while every day of the year, historic Old Town Park City wines and dines its guests with excellent restaurants and bistros. And there's no better way to experience this beautiful destination than from the comfort and privacy of our Park City vacation rentals!

Family Home between the Fairways with Views!

That 70's House on the Water

Offering activities, views and unique experiences for every type of traveler, planning a great escape to a Lake Tahoe vacation rental unlocks a world of adventures. Tahoe is more than just the meeting place of California and Nevada; it includes the crystal blue waters of Lake Tahoe, snow-capped mountains, and long hikes through lush natural forests. From lakefront cottages to cozy ski cabins, Tahoe vacation homes offer access to world-class skiing at resorts like Heavenly, Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, and Northstar. Enjoy the sparkling nightlife at area casinos Crystal Bay and Harvey's Resort, and practice your golf swing at any number of greens - Old Brockway, Coyote Moon, or the Bijou, just to name a few.

Foodies also have much to get excited about in this cosmopolitan mountain region. Local eateries showcasing fresh, regional ingredients in a variety of establishments for every taste and mood is the norm. Whether it's a plate of Sierra Powder Sushi Rolls at The Naked Fish in South Lake Tahoe, pints of Manifesto Pale Ale and Chicken Wings at Fifty Fifty Brewing Company in Truckee, or Durham Ranch Filet Mignon at Wolfdale's Cuisine Unique in Tahoe City, everyone will be sure to find something that delights their palette.

Nestled in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Truckee is just a hair west of the Nevada state line. Boasting 270 trails, 43 ski lifts, eight mountain peaks, and six terrain parks, this town is for the true outdoor adventurer. But wait: there's also an abundance of dining options, coffee houses, galleries and shops to satisfy a variety of visitors.  Nearby Northstar-Truckee is home to the famous Northstar Resort, with year-round activities from skiing and snowboarding to golfing and hiking.

Right on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe is Kings Beach, a community brimming with outdoor activities! Kings Beach State Recreation Area has over 700 feet of sandy beach for beachcombing, sand castle building, and just plain relaxing. Close to skiing and fishing as well, there's also casino gambling and entertainment nearby just across the Nevada state line at Crystal Bay.

An outdoor lover's dream, Tahoe Vista is a small community just west of Kings Beach, joined by its charming neighbor, Carnelian Bay. Picture yourself in a cute vacation getaway right near the water in either of these two postcard-perfect spots!

If you like a little more liveliness in your destination, Tahoe City is a vibrant, fun-filled playground right on the lake, with three great beaches - Tahoe City Commons, Tahoe State Recreation Area, and Lake Forest Beach. From here, you can take your pick of activities - enjoy a cruise around the lake, play golf at Tahoe City's historic course, raft the river, or in winter make the short drive to a number of ski resorts.

Just northwest of Tahoe City along Highway 89, Olympic Valley lies on the banks of the Truckee River. Home to Squaw Valley Ski Resort, this is the spot for world-class skiing and snowboarding. With a stay in a cozy ski condo, in addition to all the winter sports, you'll be ideally located to take the aerial tramway 8,200 feet to the resort's High Camp to enjoy dining, swimming in the heated pool, and a spectacular view of the surrounding peaks.

Not too far away, the ski resort towns of Alpine Meadows and Homewood are veritable winter wonderlands. From a private vacation lodge, to a ski-themed condo, these two locations are a great choice for avid winter sports enthusiasts. Just south of Homewood lies Tahoma, an area surrounded by natural scenic wonders. From your cabin in the woods, it's just a short distance to dog-friendly Bliss State Park, with its amazing mountain and lake views. Close by there's also Meeks Bay Resort and Marina, a popular place for water skiing, picnicking, and relaxing on the pristine sandy beach.

What can we say about South Lake Tahoe? There's the restaurants, clubs, and casinos. But then there's also canoeing  on the lake, golfing on a sunny afternoon, and hiking in a grove of pines - all with the backdrop of the majestic Sierra Nevadas. This is a truly unforgettable destination with something special in store for every kind of traveler!

The communities and cities around Lake Tahoe are as diverse as the many different year-round activities available in this scenic outdoor utopia - and we have the perfect Tahoe vacation rental just waiting for your next adventure!

The Chalet at the Lodge at Vail #4

It's no wonder the Vail Valley is one of the top destinations in the country for spending an adventure-packed vacation in cozy ski cabins or luxurious Vail Valley rentals! Boasting the second largest ski mountain in North America, five-star dining, fantastic festivals, countless trailheads, and more natural splendor than your senses can absorb, this premiere Colorado resort region attracts thousands of visitors each year in hopes of experiencing an authentic taste of Rocky Mountain living at its best.

It's surprisingly easy to get around the entire valley with the largest free transportation system in the country. You'll find convenient shuttle bus access near many of our rentals to whisk you away to the heart of Vail - even if you decide to stay in a peaceful cabin rental closer to a rushing river than a bustling ski resort.

For those who do like to keep their finger on the pulse of the town, you won't find a better spot than our luxury vacation ski homes in Vail itself, within walking distance to dozens of hotspots in Vail Village, Golden Peak, and Lionshead. Bavarian-style villages and pedestrian streets exude an Old World charm and host diverse boutiques and dining, from sandwich shops to five-star cuisine. Sunny pub decks invite you to share a mid-day beer, while dance clubs, live music, and karaoke bars bring the village to life once the sun sets. And, of course, the carefully manicured slopes of Vail Mountain are just steps away.

Looking for peace and quiet in your Vail Valley vacation home? Just five miles east, with stunning mountain and valley vistas, over 18 bikes paths, and a plethora of hiking trails just out your front door, our East Vail ski home rentals will provide an ideal gateway to the natural beauty and outside attractions of Vail Valley, without the crowds. Fish along Gore Creek, hike up the six mile trail to awe-inspiring Booth Falls, then take advantage of the hot tubs, pools, steam rooms, and recreation center at the Vail Racquet Club. For the more daring souls, the East Vail Chutes provide difficult terrain and a unique challenge for more advanced skiers. On the other side of town, West Vail was originally an expansion of Vail Resort, but is now a quiet, residential neighborhood. It's only a short drive or free shuttle ride away from the world famous resort, but a vacation rental here is a little less hectic than Vail Village, and ideally situated to exploit both the sunshine from the north, and the scenic alpine vistas from the south.

Head further west and you'll have your choice of not one, but two renowned ski resorts within close reach when you choose from our private vacation homes or condos in the quaint town of Avon, just 10 miles from the Vail slopes, and home to the fabulous Beaver Creek Resort. Known for its upscale and family-friendly accommodations, Beaver Creek Resort is comprised of three villages: Beaver Creek Village, Bachelor's Gulch, and Arrowhead, each connected by catwalks and boasting 25 ski lifts and 1,832 skiable acres. Visitors will enjoy ice skating in the center of the village, art galleries, and plenty of dining and shopping. In the summer, go paddle boarding on Nottingham Lake and don't miss the largest fireworks display over the Colorado Rockies.

Further west and set in a more quiet and residential community, our mountain homes in Eagle-Vail and Edwards will attract those looking for a more peaceful retreat. Located between Avon and Vail in the heart of the Eagle River Valley, Eagle-Vail is home to one of the finest golf courses around at the EagleVail Golf Club, as well as a deluxe public pool in the summer and excellent cross country ski trails in winter. A bit more removed, yet just 10 minutes to Beaver Creek and 20 to Vail, Edwards offers its scenic Riverwalk dotted with boutique shops, a world-class spa, and upscale dining at exquisite bistros and wine bars. Fresh waters, like the nearby Eagle River, will delight fisherman and entice kayakers, rafters and floaters alike.

About 25 miles further west, the small town of Gypsum occupies a prime spot right in the middle of the Rocky Mountains. From a vacation home surrounded by Red Mountain and Tenmile Peak, explore miles and miles of off-roading, hiking and biking trails, and cross-country and snowshoeing the backcountry in winter.

Choose your perfect vacation rental from our large selection of Vail Valley ski rentals including homes, cabins, and condos to discover how each of these charming mountain towns offer its own vantage point and unique access to the bountiful recreation activities throughout the White River National Forest that awaits each season.

Then hit the slopes at Dollar Mountain for beginner to intermediate runs, cross-country skiing at the Sun Valley Nordic and Snowshoe Center, and even holiday sleigh rides your whole group will enjoy. Of course, the more experience skier may want to check out the action at Bald Mountain, with its 3,400 vertical feet of slopes - but that mountain is just on the other side of town!

Now, don't go thinking that Sun Valley is just for winter. In nice weather, take a trip up the ski lifts and mountain bike down on dirt trails past wildflowers. Or gear up and check out trout fishing on some of the world's best fly fishing streams. With some luck, later you'll be sitting down to a perfectly cooked Trout Almondine in your comfortable Sun Valley vacation rental!

Like Sun Valley, nearby Ketchum (it's less than two miles southwest) is sandwiched between Bald and Dollar Mountains and right by all the resort action, but Ketchum is also a bustling little town in its own right. Set against snow-capped mountains, sparkling freshwater streams, funky galleries and shops downtown, with a lot of bright, year-round sunshine. A four season destination just like its neighbor to the northeast, it's the ideal location for vacation lodging like a golf condo or a cabin  in town.

In summer, its bright sun and warm afternoons make Ketchum a prime setting for a round of golf. Just north of downtown, the Bigwood Golf Course is a 9 hole, par 36 course and nearby, the Sun Valley Resort Golf Course has 18 holes for your tee off enjoyment. And after your game, head back to your Ketchum vacation home to lounge on the deck with a glass of wine before walking to the charming downtown for a delicious dinner out. If you visit in July, you may be able to check out the Ketchum Arts Festival, with over 100 artist booths, live music, food, and kids' activities.

Like many of the great Western ski towns, Sun Vally and Ketchum have it all - excitement, beautiful scenery, and lots to do, but here you'll find it all at an unhurried, laid back pace. So, leave the lines behind and pick your perfect Sun Valley condo or Ketchum cottage from our growing list of Sun Valley / Ketchum vacation rentals and start exploring the beautiful, central Idaho mountains.

Arrow Point, Lake Coeur d'Alene Views At Their Best

Boasting an incredible variety of activities, our Coeur d'Alene vacation rentals have something for everyone - from a sleek and modern condo in the city, near galleries, restaurants, and shopping to a cozy cabin in the wilderness, where you can fish, hike, and enjoy being surrounded by nature.

You'll be able to take in all the sights - lakes, the Coeur d'Alene National Forest, and even a segment of the northern Rocky Mountains (the Bitterroot Range) from here. This part of the Idaho Panhandle will definitely delight vacationers with a wide range of activities and multitude of incredible landscapes. There's even a blossoming North-Central Idaho wine region for wine connoisseurs to discover, a movement led by Coeur d'Alene Cellars, a small, family-owned winery.

Where to start your northern Idaho adventure? Couer d'Alene itself is much smaller than its big city neighbors towards the west coast, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in style. From a swanky, modern condo downtown, you'll have a prime location for the monthly Second Friday Artwalk, numerous dining options, a cruise on Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Sunday Market, even a relaxing afternoon at Spa Coeur d'Alene. And if you hear the call of the outdoors,  you're still close to skiing at Silver Mountain Resort, the 24 mile, multi-use Centennial Trail, and kayaking out on the lake.

A mere 37 miles south of Coeur d'Alene, lies quaint and historic Harrison, a terrific choice for a cycle-centric getaway. Home to a spot along the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes, a 72 miles paved trail that goes all the way from Mullan by the Montana border, through Harrison, and straight on west to Plummer, near Washington. In addition, outdoor adventurers will have parks, trails, and lakes to explore, jog, hike, and boat. A charming Harrison cabin in the woods puts you right in the middle of the great outdoors, but still near an historic downtown with a small selection of shops, galleries, and eateries.

North of Coeur d'Alene, only six miles to be exact, is another small town full of Idaho charm. Hayden, right near scenic Lake Hayden, is your home base for enticing getaway packed full of water sports like fishing, jet skiing, and boating, to more leisurely activities like golfing, or just plain relaxing on the front porch. From your Haden vacation home, you'll be right near over 40 miles of shoreline, as well as only a short car ride from all the action in bustling Coeur d'Alene to the south.

On your next Pacific Northwest vacation, you may just want to head a bit inland to Idaho. Whether you choose a modern retreat in the city, a quiet lakefront cabin, or a condo on the edge of a meticulously manicured golf course, a stay in a Coeur d'Alene vacation rental will leave you counting down the days until your return to this beautiful, full-of-surprises Idaho destination!

Belize is known for its laid-back attitude, diverse ecosystems, and ample adventure opportunities, which all combine to form a wonderful vacation destination! Bordered to the north by Mexico, the south and west by Guatemala, and the east by the Caribbean Sea, Belize is one of the top travel spots in Central America.

There's a ton to love about Belize, but perhaps its biggest attraction is the beautiful beach. With hundreds of miles of coastline, you can relax while strolling barefoot along the soft sand - working only on your tan! You could also explore the coastal mangrove swamps or rent some snorkeling or scuba gear and dive underwater to discover the sea life around the Belize Barrier Reef. With more than 450 small offshore islands, an abundance of fresh seafood, and some of the most scenic coastline in the world, the shores of Belize may just be the perfect place for a beach getaway. Spots like Placencia exemplify Belize's laid-back, picture-perfect beach getaways!

Things to Do in Belize

If you prefer to seek out adventures, the interior of the country has many tantalizing options. The pristine, sunny beaches of the coast quickly give way to a rainforest-type atmosphere that is teeming with life and excitement. In the western Cayo District, you will find dense hardwood forests with hidden waterfalls, mysterious caves, and hundreds of species of wildlife. This jungle is an ideal place to enjoy a breathtaking hike through the trees, kayak down a river, go spelunking, or take a scenic guided horseback ride. Belize still has a prominent Mayan influence, but for a real taste of history you will enjoy taking a daytrip to numerous Mayan ruins, including Caracol, Xunantunich, Altun Ha, and Lamanai, where you can marvel at the architectural feats and dream of days past.

Eco-tourism brings many visitors to Belize, and the country is well-known for its toucans, tapirs, and monkeys. It even features the world's premier jaguar refuge at Cockscomb Basin. A large portion of the wilderness is protected, so the land is as unspoiled - and as beautiful - as possible. With a low human population density and a huge expanse of jungle, plants and animals truly thrive here.

The Crimson Pelican at The Highlands

Beaches Fourplex: 4 Private Getaways for Up to 14!

You, Me and the Sea

By the Bay Cottage in Old Town

Shiloh by the Sea with Hot Tub!

The Best Little Beach House on the Oregon Coast!

Spending time in one of our Oregon Coast vacation rentals is the perfect way to experience this spectacular region, from cooking freshly-caught crab in your own kitchen to relaxing in a luxurious oceanfront hot tub! The hardest choice may be deciding which bustling coastal town or quiet oceanside neighborhood to call home during your visit.

Just don't even think about calling it "the beach". To Oregonians (both natives and transplants), all 363 miles of rocky cliffs, white sandy shores, and unbelievably panoramic views lining the Pacific Ocean is simply known as "the coast". And Oregon loves her coast. Since 1967, the entire stretch has been preserved as free, publicly accessible land, essentially creating one incredibly diverse public park that includes bustling seaports, windswept sand dunes, pine-covered cliffs, and romantic lighthouses... and there's no better way to experience this region like a local than by staying in one of our Oregon Coast beach rentals.

The coast is informally divided into three sections: north, central, and south. The northern coast stretches from historic Astoria on the Columbia River to Cascade Head, a prominent headland jutting out into the ocean just south of Neskowin. In between, the well-traveled region is home to many of the coast's most popular tourist destinations: bustling Seaside, charming Cannon Beach, and the famous cheese factory of Tillamook. Families and fishermen alike flock to scenic Rockaway Beach.

For those seeking peace and quiet, smaller villages like Manzanita, Oceanside, Arch Cape, and Netarts offer a more laid-back pace of life. Quintessential northern coast experiences include exploring the tidepools at Haystack Rock, photographing historic lighthouses along the scenic Three Capes Drive, and stopping for the state's freshest seafood in a fishing village like Barview or Garibaldi. Don't miss the fresh pints at the Pelican Pub and Brewery and lively dory boats at beautiful Pacific City.

The central Oregon coast is wildly diverse, encompassing state parks perched along rugged cliffs and tourist towns dotting sandy beaches before giving way to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. One of the most popular destinations for Oregon beach vacation rentals, bustling Lincoln City in the north draws thousands of visitors with its dining scene, casinos, and shopping, along with a long stretch of gorgeous sandy beach. Heading south along Highway 101, the central coast includes the Whale Watching Capital of the Oregon Coast at Depoe Bay, the lively harbor of Newport and its famous aquarium (not to mention the Rogue brewery), and world-class crabbing in Waldport. Scenic Cape Perpetua soars above the ocean for some of the coast's finest views and clifftop hikes, while further south, the towering sand dunes make for a delightful summer playground and the town of Yachats boasts a lively arts scene and some excellent dining options.

The southern Oregon coast is much further from the state's population centers of Portland, Salem, and Eugene, and accordingly is much less traveled. After bustling Coos Bay, the southern coast is dotted with only a few small towns along the miles of sandy coastline stretching down to California. Visitors to this region often make the pilgrimage to the famous courses at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, take a jet boat ride up the Rogue River, or simply find their private stretch of beach and soak up the southern coast's more abundant sunshine.

Whether you stay in a luxurious oceanfront estate or one of our charming Oregon Coast yurts, your stay in this beautiful destination will certainly leave you feeling relaxed and rejuvenated!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Panama/
The land of "abundant fish, trees, and butterflies" is also the land of abundant sunshine, mountains, rainforests, beaches, and friendly locals! From cosmopolitan Panama City to coffee-centric Boquete to quaint El Valle de Antón, Panama is a country of sharp contrasts and cultural diversity.

More than 12 percent of the people are indigenous, with a large segment of the rest being of Afro-Antillean or Chinese origin. The food is a confluence of these cultures, as is the music and the colorful native dress, the pollera. Dance with other revelers during Carnaval in Panama City, or celebrate the Fiesta de San Juan Bautista in Chitré. Whatever you choose, our Panama vacation rentals are a great place to call home in this beguiling land.

Like other Caribbean nations, Panamanian culture is a mix of African, Native American and European influences, making it an appealing travel destination for anyone looking for urbanity and tradition. Pre-Columbian cultures included the Chibchan, Chocoan and Cueva peoples, all hunter gatherers. Once the Spanish arrived in 1501, courtesy of Rodrigo de Bastidas, the country became an economic and strategic powerhouse. Spain ruled for more than 300 years, using the tiny nation as a gateway to the lucrative Orient. Today it remains a gateway from west to east, thanks to the impressive Panama Canal.

The nation's capital, Panama City, is an international banking center divided into corregimientos, or quarters, with the old quarter attracting the most visitors thanks to its well-preserved colonial architecture and myriad old churches and plazas. Explore Panama Viejo, the old capital just minutes from downtown Panama City. This UNESCO World Heritage Site includes the ruins of the first Spanish city on the Pacific.

Heading out of the capital, visitors will come across white sand beaches, lush rainforests, and a plethora of coffee plantations. The Archipelago de Bocas del Toro is on Panama's west coast border with Costa Rica. Sink your feet in the white sand or explore a hidden cove on a lazy summer day. The Archipelago de San Blas is old-school Panama with nary a condo or mall in sight, but plenty of palm trees, soft sand and turquoise water. The uninhabited Cayos Los Grullos, Holandeses, and Ordupuquip are popular with yachters and off-the-beaten-track types. Playa Coronado is just one hour away from Panama City, and boasts white powder and big city conveniences. Playa Barqueta near the town of David is popular with surfers and turtle-hatching enthusiasts.

Near the Costa Rican border lies the province of Chiriquí. Mountains give way to beautiful valleys and waterfalls. Head up to the small town of Boquete, famous for its coffee. Many of the area's producers - some of the world's best - host tours and tastings throughout the year. A thriving expat community in town means more chances to go river rafting, hiking, or biking near Volcán Barú, the country's highest point.

A stay in one of our Panama vacation rentals isn't complete without a journey into the country's intriguing and dynamic interior. The provinces of Veraguas, Los Santos, Herrera, and Cocle offer a pleasing variance to the popular coastal towns. Isla Colba, a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its pristine rainforests, sits in the Pacific and is a draw for scuba divers. Penonome boasts the Omar Torrijos National Park, a vast wildlife refuge with great hiking trails. The Sarigua National Park in Parita features 8,000 hectares of semi-desert and a pre-Columbian settlement. El Valle de Antón is a quaint town in the middle of an extinct volcano and lush forests, luring hikers and bikers galore.

If it's sun, sand, and culture you crave, then head down to Panama. Our luxurious Panama vacation rentals await your arrival!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Mexico/
A land of ancient ruins, bustling metropolises, sandy beaches, and hospitable people, Mexico has lured travelers for many centuries. A confluence of Meso-American and European culture, Mexico enthralls thanks to its colonial architecture, vast plateaus and mountains, and the majestic Rio Grande. Our gorgeous Mexico vacation rentals are a great base from which to explore this proud and beguiling land, from sea to shining sea.

Encompassing nearly 760,000 square miles, Mexico is as complex and varied as its people and history. The Mayans, Toltecs, Aztecs, and Spainards have all laid claim to its vast riches and you can see remnants of these ancient civilizations in places such as Teotihuacan, Chichen Itza, Monte Alban, and Tulum. "New Spain," as it was called for nearly 300 years, is responsible for the lovely colonial cities of Puebla and Zacatecas as well as numerous cathedrals and forts scattered throughout the country. During this time, Mexico introduced the world to tequila and what has become the most popular ethnic cuisine in the United States, both of which you can enjoy from your Mexico vacation rental.

Mexico abuts the Pacific Ocean, and the west coast affords visitors many quaint small and large towns along nearly 4,600 miles of coastline, from the Baja peninsula to the border of Guatemala. Head to Cabo if you're into tony resorts and celeb sightings. Puerto Vallarta still appeals to lovers - 50 years after Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton put it on the map - thanks to soft breezes, white sand, and lush orchids. Acapulco, the "Pearl of the Pacific," is just that: a shining jewel filled with charming cliffside restaurants and secluded beaches. The Michoacan Coast, between Nayarit and Oaxaca, boasts secluded beaches and coves amid mango and papaya groves. Punta Mita features many luxury resorts as well as restaurants catering to the jet set. Costalegre is truly the "Coast of Joy," thanks to an abundance of picturesque sleepy fishing villages.

Heading west, you'll encounter Mexico's capital and one of the largest cities in the world. With nearly nine million residents, Mexico City is a bustling financial capital but still retains a bit of vintage appeal. The neighborhood of San Angel, just five miles south of the city center, boasts cobblestone streets, Colonial-era architecture, and a variety of world-class museums. Xochimilco is another appealing Colonial-era gem, thanks to its floating gardens, brick streets, and 50 miles of canals. Condesa and Roma, two adjacent neighborhoods, are famous for their hipster vibe - think Williamsburg meets St. Germain - as well as their Art Deco buildings.

Further west towards the Gulf of Mexico, you'll find bustling resort towns with a decidedly more American flavor than those on the Pacific rim. From colonial resplendent Merida to the shopper's mecca of Playa del Carmen, the Yucatan Peninsula boasts myriad places to savor Mexican hospitality. Explore the Gran Museo del Mundo Maya in Merida before heading to the Mayan ruins in Uxmal. Playa del Carmen plays host to many a cruise ship so don't be surprised if you spy boat loads of tourists at the pre-Colombian walled city of Tulum (40 miles away) or the Sian Ka'an biosphere reserve (86 miles away), a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Regardless of which of our Mexico vacation rentals you choose to stay in, you'll be sure to enjoy the sun, sites, and flavors of Mexico.

When Eric and his wife Alia took responsibility for caring for Alia's family’s summer home, he learned firsthand how much work vacation homes can really be. And when he discovered there wasn’t a professional management company on the West Coast that could provide the services he was looking for, he decided to start one? and that’s how Vacasa was born. Today, the family's Long Beach, Washington cottage is one of over 1900 Vacasa homes spread throughout the globe - and our motto remains “vacation rentals made easy”.

Problem-solving, creativity, and openness: that’s our founder, CEO, and fearless leader in a nutshell. Eric has always driven Vacasa with his strong vision, but he’s also made it a priority to empower employees to help shape the company and their roles within it. Eric's conversations with Vacasa employees often start with three questions: “What do you like most about your job? What are you best at? OK, how can you spend more of your time doing that?”

Eric lives in Boise with his wife Alia and their two sons, Rhys and Rowen. He bikes to work daily, runs year-round, spends the summer mountain-biking, and spends the winter skiing - either backcountry, or in-bounds with his three year old son Rhys. And during Eric?s considerable travel to Vacasa destinations across the Western US, he stays in vacation rentals - to spend as much time as possible with friends, family, and employees.

Cliff is Vacasa’s co-founder, Chief Development Officer, and the most good-natured attorney you’ll ever meet. While still a member in good standing with the Colorado and California State Bars, Cliff’s role at Vacasa has always been more about relationship-building.

Since he first joined Eric at his kitchen table to launch Vacasa back in 2009, Cliff has overseen the expansion of our family of Vacasa home owners. Today, he leads our business development team with his obvious passion for connecting with our owners and sharing how Vacasa can make their lives easier.

Cliff lives in Southeast Portland with his wife Kate and their lab/pit mix Muddy, adopted from Portland's Pixie Project. In addition to his role at Vacasa, Cliff serves as a board member for Eugene-based MAPLE Microdevelopment. He has also completed the Eugene Marathon in 2012 and 2013 as part of a benefit for MAPLE, and he has produced, directed, and acted in several theatrical productions from Boston to Denver... and Cliff leads Vacasa’s Portland kickball team (although we don’t hold our abysmal 2014 record against him).

Kimberly’s current title is Vice-President of Operations, but she’s worn a lot of hats since being hired in 2010 as Vacasa’s third-ever employee. Today, she applies her attention to detail and hands-on leadership style to nearly all the areas she previously worked in: housekeeping, property management, maintenance, owner services, and guest experience.

With a professional background in interior design, Kimberly’s been known to rearrange furniture constantly (her own, her friends’, whomever doesn’t try too hard to stop her) and fulfill the Portlandia stereotype by making jewelry on the side.

If you want to talk about numbers, Scott’s listening - or two steps ahead. Since joining Vacasa in 2013, he has introduced our company - and in many ways, the vacation rental industry - to the power of data. From our rate optimization algorithms to the nitty-gritty of our marketing strategy, Scott has helped use data to deliver a better experience to our owners and our guests.

Scott's a tried-and-true Northeast Portlander, where he lives with his wife Lisa and hound dog Juno. He’s been actively involved in community-building, from serving as Chair of the King Neighborhood Association to co-founding the Friends of Last Thursday Art Walk organization. When not crunching numbers or supporting civic functions, you'll find Scott snowboarding on Mt. Hood or exploring the bountiful hikes Oregon provides. Scott also likes to stage his life milestones on mountaintops: he proposed to Lisa on Mount St. Helen’s, and they tied the knot at Skibowl’s warming hut on Mt. Hood.

Erik-with-a-K is our wizard behind the curtain: as CTO since 2011, he oversees all of our in-house technology, from our business applications to our website to our Smart Home Automation systems. And he does it all from his farm in southwest Washington, where he lives with his wife Jenni, daughter Maple, and a menagerie of horses, chickens, geese, dogs, and a guinea pig.

Erik’s professional background and personal interests are centered around open-source hardware and software. His “side project” is Digistump, a company he began after creating three of the most successful Kickstarter projects in the Portland area (Digispark, DigiX, and Digispark Pro). This led to Erik being featured in Steven Osborn’s book “Makers at Work: Folks Reinventing the World One Object or Idea at a Time”. And in his nearly nonexistent free time, Erik continues to be involved in the tech community by serving as an advisor to start-ups like Glowdeck and Brewbot.

We are not a single office, position, department, city, or region - we are a team! Every employee at Vacasa is critical to our success and our mission. We encourage employees to take advantage of each of our teammates' skills and talents for problem-solving - and treat other teammates with the same respect that they want to receive.

As we grow, both learning and teaching are critical to our team's success. Each team member should take the time to teach their co-workers how to be successful in areas in which they excel, and ask for insight from their teammates. Continually seek growth for themselves as an individual, for their role within Vacasa, and for Vacasa itself as a company.

3. We count on you

Behind each positive guest experience are countless Vacasa employees that were involved in creating that result. Any missing part to our machine jeopardizes our ability to deliver. We count on each employee to be on time, to complete their tasks, and to excel in their role. Each employee's input is crucial to our success!

4. Do the right thing

Be honest, be trustworthy, be ethical - even when no one is looking.

Vacation rentals made easy." We conduct business simply to create a consistent experience for owners, guests, and employees alike.

We help create amazing memories and fun experiences for our guests and owners. Our employees carry that into the workplace to create a positive and enjoyable environment with their teams every day.

Lots of growth requires lots of change - so embrace it! If an employee thinks a process could be easier or more efficient, they are encouraged to talk to their manager and take ownership to drive change in that area and each employee is asked to support the changes their teammates are driving in other areas.

Because "This is the way it has always been done" is never good enough. Instead, employees are encouraged seek out new ways to improve our policies and practices - and always be open-minded to new ideas, pushing the limits, and willing to think outside the box.

Here at Vacasa, we help travelers experience unforgettable vacations...and we look at working at Vacasa as an epic adventure of its own!

When you grow as quickly as we have been, every year (and month, and week, and OK, every day!) is an exciting one. We embrace opportunities, and have a tendency to hand out responsibilities to our employees to see how they can stretch and challenge themselves. This is a place to grow as an individual, and to be part of our collective growth as a company and a team...and so far, it's been an unbelievably rewarding journey together.

Day-to-day, we also have a lot of fun. We don't all work in the same office, of course—there's our Portland headquarters, our second office in Boise, and hundreds of amazing Vacasa teams across the country caring for homes, helping guests, and growing our business. Our local teams become very tight-knit, but we also love to gather in bigger groups at our regional Vaconferences, where our Vacasa leaders make sure that every employee understands the company's vision, our mission, and how much we appreciate every Vacaser from coast to coast!

Since our founding in 2009, Vacasa has grown from a single home in Long Beach, WA to managing thousands of homes, from beach cottages on the Oregon Coast to ski cabins in Vermont to tropical retreats in Belize—and beyond! We were ranked #9 on the Inc 500 in 2014 and continue to expand exponentially. The secret to our success? Exceptional local team members, a system that makes things easy, and a strong passion for the work we do!

Our rapid growth offers tremendous potential, and our company is committed to cultivating individual talents and skill sets. If you're looking to get out of a dead-end job, Vacasa is the place for you! Vacasa is looking to fill numerous job openings in our several growing regions.

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Australia/
It's been called the land Down Under, OZ, and Great Southern Land. Immortalized in book, music, and film, Australia beguiles the senses with beautiful coastal beaches, verdant valleys, snow-capped peaks, and a savage and majestic interior. With only 23 million people in a country approximately the size of the United States, there's plenty of space to roam as wild and free as the land. From cosmopolitan Sydney to chic Melbourne to trendy Brisbane to laid back Perth, our Australia vacation rentals will place you in a holiday mindset the minute you walk through the door!

First sighted by Europeans in 1606 and first settled more than 150 years later, Australia has a unique and somewhat turbulent history. Established as a British penal colony - many modern-day Aussies proudly trace their lineage back to the original convicts - the country became a gold rush and agricultural mecca in the 1800s, increasing the population tenfold. Today, Australia's demographics are as diverse as the country itself. You'll find Asian, Greek, and Eastern European businesses in many of the big cities.

Abutting the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Australia is a land of sharp contrasts across seven unique territories. The eastern territories - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania - features sun-kissed beaches, green valleys, and majestic rivers. While the central and western territories - South Australia, Northern Territory, and Western Australia - boast rugged landscapes and laid back cities.

New South Wales is the most popular state and the one that gets the most foreign visitors. Sydney boasts beautiful beaches filled with beautiful people - Bondi Beach is a can't-miss stop! Don't forget to dine at one of the Michelin-starred restaurants or take in a performance at the iconic Sydney Opera House. Throughout New South Wales you'll find plentiful beaches and friendly small towns, from blink-and-you'd-miss-it Bungowannah to surfing mecca Wollongong to koala paradise Port Macquarie.

?Queenland is the state of sunshine and surf, with gorgeous coastal hamlets and a vibrant surfing culture. Brisbane is the largest city and features 12 months of sunshine, as well as beautiful parks, art galleries, and an increasingly hip populace. The Sunshine Coast is just 64 miles to the north, offering exactly what it describes. Cairns is your entry to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the most pristine natural wonders of the world. Grab your snorkel gear and make sure to take pictures since it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience!

Heading south and to the west, you'll come across stately Victoria. Chic Melbourne is known for its world-renowned fashion houses and cultural offerings, including the Victorian Arts Centre and the Australian Ballet. Victoria (and part of New South Wales) is also home to the Australian Alps, the only snow-capped areas in the country and the land's sole ski destination.

Tasmania is the island off the island, featuring unique flora and fauna - don't worry, the Tasmanian Devil won't hurt you - and a host of festivals throughout the year. The capital, Hobart, is the second oldest in the country and is a popular port for ships of all varieties, although most specifically for scientists heading to Antarctic bases. The city is also known for its well-preserved Georgian and Victorian architecture.

The center of the country is as beautiful and awe-inspiring as the coastal portions! South Australia is known for its 18 world-class wine regions, most notably the Barossa Valley. Make a day of savoring the award-winning Shiraz and Colombard! Regal Adelaide boasts numerous dance companies, as well as a love for Aussie Rules Football, rugby, cricket, and even basketball.

Head north and you'll enter the Northern Territory, the least populated of the Aussie states and one of the most ethnically diverse. You'll find numerous national parks within its half million square miles. The capital of Darwin is tropical in climate and relaxed in nature! Most of the population lives along the Stuart Highway in the towns of Palmerston, Alice Springs, Katherine, Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek. Hop on the legendary Ghan railway, one of the most epic train journeys in the world. The locomotive traverses nearly 1,900 miles of desert terrain from Darwin to Adelaide. Stop off in Alice Springs and head to Uluru (Ayers Rock), the red monolith sacred to the Aboriginals. You'll find springs, rock caves, and paintings at this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Western Australia is the largest territory in the country and is so wild and untamed that few reside outside of the Southwestern border. Much of the interior has been unfortunately abused by farmers, leading to its designation as a biodiversity hotspot. Perth is the largest city, with arts organizations aplenty and a strong local music scene. The town of Freemantle features many well-preserved 19th century buildings.

From sea to shining sea, Australia enchants and our Australia vacation rentals are the best choice in holiday accommodations in this mesmerizing land!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/chile/
Chile’s unique landscape—situated between the endless Pacific coastline and the towering Andes Mountains—fill this South American country with major bucket-list items worth checking off! About 17.3 million people live in this beautiful and diverse nation, with the bustling capital of Santiago home to about six million. Whether you’re learning the Cueca (the national dance), climbing a massive volcano overlooking a bright blue lake, or kicking around at the locals’ fútbol game, Chile provides endless options for cultural and outdoor activity. Through a history of mixing of European colonization and indigenous people, this part of South America has a unique culture, language, and landscape that's all its own.

Bordering Peru and characterized by the Atacama Desert, the Norte Grande (far north) of Chile is best known for its extreme climates. The Atacama Desert, a plateau that runs east from the Andes, is so arid that it’s known as the “driest place on earth” – most of it receives barely an inch of rain per year, and some places haven’t seen a drop for centuries. Besides its reputation for dryness, the Norte Grande also boasts spectacular scenery like salt flats, geysers, volcanoes, and coastal bluffs. Many types of vegetation and animals grow and thrive north of the Atacama near the Loa River and surrounding valley. Chile’s most precious copper, nitrate, and silver deposits and mines are also found in Norte Grande and worth seeing, especially the Chuquicamata, which is the biggest open-pit copper mine in the world. Antofagasta, the largest city in this region, has incredible coastal views and an economy based on the port activity and minerals found nearby.

Just south of the Norte Grande region is Norte Chico (the near north), which stretches from the southern border of the Atacama to just above the capital city of Santiago. Home to Chile’s highest peak, a stratovolcano named Ojos del Salado, as well as Laguna Verde (its ultra-famous lake), this region is mountainous and has distinct valley ranges that run all the way from the Andes to the Pacific Coast. The climate is a bit more forgiving than its northern neighbor, with moderate temperatures and more rainfall. The Elqui Valley is the most famous part of the Norte Chico, ideal for cattle-raising and growing fruit, and almost all Pisco (the ubiquitous and delicious Chilean brandy) is grown here. On the western coast, high bluffs that overlook the Pacific form more distinct microclimates, and La Serena is popularly for its beautiful beaches.

Known as the “heartland” of Chile with the largest urban areas and rich agricultural resources, the Zona Central is a beautiful and diverse region to visit. Home to the Central Valley (located between the Andes to the east and the coastal mountain ranges west), this area has a fertile Mediterranean climate ideal for growing fresh fruits, grapes for wine, and other agricultural exports. There’s great alpine skiing in the Andes due to higher precipitation, and there are also lush old-growth forests and national parks to the south. Four incredible urban areas call the Zona Central home: the capital of Santiago, the populous Concepción, and the colorful coastal cities of Valparaíso and Viña del Mar. The Zona Central holds about two-thirds of the country’s population, and for good reason!

Reaching from the waters of the Río Bío-Bío in the north to the Isla de Chiloé in the south, the Zona Sur is known as the “lake district” of Chile. With the rugged backdrop of the Andes mountains to the west, there are numerous turquoise lakes that spot the horizon amidst snow-covered volcanoes and green farmlands. Adrenaline-pumping adventure sport meccas beckon tourists from all over the world to the Zona Sur with tons of hiking, kayaking, volcano-scaling, and snowboarding options abound. Pucón and Puerto Varas are known for their sports-centric audiences, while Temuco, Valdivia, and Osorno hold most of the region’s population.

Perhaps the most spectacular yet extreme part of Chile, the Zona Austral offers a variety of landscapes all the way from the glaciers of Patagonia down to Punta Arenas, the largest and southernmost city on the planet. Much of the Zona Austral is not properly explored, providing exciting and untouched landscape for thousands of miles. The gorgeous granite peaks of Torres del Paine National Park are rightfully a well-known destination in this region of the Chilean Patagonia bordering Argentina, and a series of snow-capped mountains and volcanoes lead down to the coastline. Thousands of islands surround the coast off of Punta Arenas and Tierra del Fuego, including the well-known Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez.

Whether you're braving the heat of the sprawling Atacama Desert in the north or hitting the Andes for some world-class skiing and snowboarding in the south, the diverse and stunning country of Chile offers something for people of all ages and backgrounds to enjoy. With the popularity of outdoor sporting options and a rich, diverse language and culture, find out for yourself why this country is quickly becoming a top tourist destination with a stay in one of our Chile vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Italy/
Ahh, Italia… even the name of this beautiful country is easy on the taste buds! Known as lo Stivale (the boot), Italy is the fifth most-visited country in the world, and for a variety of reasons. Home to exquisite artwork, varied terrain that includes everything from sky-high mountains to sweltering seasides, and, of course, outrageously delicious food, you can't go wrong in practically any corner of this sprawling country. Whether you're gazing at the Tower of Pisa or devouring a plate of carbonara, Italy has something for everyone to enjoy!

This stunning area is known for its towering mountains, colorful cliffside towns, sparkling lakes, and fashion-forward cities – each of which has its own unique history and attractions.

Mont Blanc (15,781 ft.), located just between the border of France and Italy, is the highest mountain in the Alps as well as the prime destination for many adventurers looking for skiing, snowboarding, and mountaineering. Lake Como and Lake Garda are world-famous for spectacular views and waters, and you’ll lose yourself shopping in Milan and Turin, which serve as business and fashion epicenters.

Along the coast, the Italian Riviera beckons with the vibrant port city of Genoa, as well as the five charming fishing villages called the Cinque Terre!

Best-known for the flooded streets and canals of Venice, this part of Italy boasts several fantastic cities as well as famous menu items that will keep your mouth watering for days. Although it is technically sinking, the water-built city of Venice maintains a cultural richness that’s difficult to beat – the gondolas slowly cruising the canals, the fantastic art galleries and recitals, the naturally romantic backdrop - it’s all still alive and well in Venice!

The rugged limestone cliffs and mountains of the Dolomites provide epic views and great hiking options, not to mention more ski resorts. Verona, Bologna, Ferrara, Parma, and Padua are all other fabulous cities with varied cuisine and shopping options to discover.

History buffs, art addicts, and nature-lovers alike will delight in Central Italy's diverse options for indoor and outdoor activities. Whether you're wine-tasting in the rolling hills of Tuscany, admiring ultra-famous artworks in Florence, immersing yourself in the 'City of Soul' (aka Rome), or wandering the lush green national parks of Abruzzo, this region has something for everyone to appreciate.

Although La Santa Sede, or the Vatican, is technically its own independent state, the views of Rome from the top are mind-blowing - regardless of your religion!

Rich in diversity, agriculture, and spectacular landscapes, Italy's south is a must-see for anyone looking for the full Italia experience.

Filled with coastal charm and a gritty, city-centric ambiance, Naples is the heart of the south. It stubbornly adjoins the base of Mt. Vesuvius (4,203 ft.), which is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, providing for ample excitement. The Pompeii ruins are one of the most visited attractions in Italy, and the numerous rustic castles, villages, and beaches along the Amalfi Coast attract thousands of tourists each year.

The Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Sicily each boast their own varied cultural escapes and attractions as well, not to mention absolutely gorgeous coastlines and delicious cuisine.

Wine, cheese, gelato, espresso, pasta, prosecco, pizza... did we mention the wine? Spend the day exploring different terrains or stuffing your stomach, and the nights filling your ears with classical opera music, or the chatter of the passionate Italian language!

#Pathname:/usa/California/Albion/
Quiet, charming Albion, just 15 minutes south of the village of Mendocino, is a beautiful retreat perched above the meandering Albion River. Home to a historic, WWII-era wooden bridge, Albion is an especially picturesque hamlet along the scenic Mendocino coast. For a truly relaxing retreat, book one of our lovely Albion vacation rentals and learn just how peaceful California can really be.

Albion proper is small and quiet, but offers a few conveniences that travelers will appreciate, like a full-service grocery store. There's also a pair of excellent dining options for special nights out, including the Ledford House and the restaurant at the Albion River Inn. Mendocino has even more choices, and the comparatively bustling commercial center of Fort Bragg is less than half an hour north.

The true attraction of Albion is the natural beauty. While the town itself is spectacularly positioned above the churning Pacific Ocean, there are trails to hike, rivers to kayak, and forests to explore further inland. Just north of town is Van Damme State Park, and to the south is the gorgeous Navarro River, flanked by old-growth redwoods.

Along California's coastal Highway 1 lies the charming seaside town of Aptos. On an ideal location on the Central California Coast, Aptos vacation rentals are surrounded by both giant redwoods inland at Nisene Marks State Park and the stunning ocean views at Seacliff State Beach.

On Saturdays make your way to the Aptos Farmers Market at Cabrillo College to pick up farm fresh produce, artisan cheeses, locally produced olive oils, and more for memorable dinners back at your Aptos beach cottage. Not in the mood for cooking? Aptos is home to more than 50 restaurants including the delectable French dishes at local favorite Au Midi and plates of down-home comfort (along with plenty of craft beers) at Aptos Street BBQ. An 18 minute drive into the surrounding mountains to Soquel Vineyards will reward you with both wine tasting and lunch, as handmade gourmet pizza samples are typically handed out along with the tastes of zinfandel and chardonnay.

Outdoor fans should head to Manresa State Beach for swimming, beach combing, surfing, fishing, or maybe just a picnic by the shore. Easy day trips from Aptos include strolling the popular Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk for amusement park rides and entertainment, or a day at the famous Monterey Bay Aquarium to view the wonders of the ocean, a mere 45 minute drive to the south. A unique way to sightsee the area is from Santa Cruz Bike Tours, where excursions include brewery and winery visits, as well as mountain bike adventures through the redwoods.

If your vacation falls during the 4th of July, attend the "World's Shortest Parade", which follows a two-block route in downtown Aptos and features antique fire trucks, food, music, and more local attractions at the end.

One thing is for sure, whatever time of year you stay in our Aptos vacation rentals, you'll be in for a memorable, sunny, California vacation.

For those feeling a bit more adventurous, the trail extends further into Granite Chief Wilderness and connects with the Pacific Crest Trail.

For your in-town needs and nightlife cravings, Tahoe City is just five miles down the road. Bask lakeside, catch concerts and movies on the beach, and load up on supplies among their bevy of shops, restaurants, and bars.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Avila-Beach/
Escape the city and everyday stresses with a trip to one of our relaxing Avila Beach vacation rentals. As your home base for exploring the variety of California attractions, a rental in this small town is perfect for the whole family.

Halfway between the metropolises of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and just north of Pismo Beach, is the burgeoning seaside hamlet of Avila Beach. While many popular Pacific coast towns are right on California Highway One and close to US 101, Avila Beach is a haven just a few miles off of the main routes, which allows it to thrive quietly.

Once a shipping port, the town became a honeymoon getaway when hotels popped up there in the late 19th century. Today, it's a growing San Obispo Bay getaway.

Bring the kids, because there are many family-friendly activities in Avila Beach! Discover the area's marine residents at the Central Coast Aquarium right off of the boardwalk on Front Street. Then, get your produce straight from the source while apple-picking at the Avila Valley Barn.

Everyone will enjoy the three-block-long main beach where you can body-board or watch the occasional surfer from your sunny spot on the sand. On a Front Street boardwalk stroll, you'll find souvenir shops, ice cream stands, and bike rentals. To get further acquainted with the Pacific waters around the area, take a charter cruise along barnacle-dotted coves or even a whale-watching excursion. Take the trolley or a moderate hike to Point San Luis Lighthouse where you might spy snacking sea otters and sunbathing harbor seals.

A unique attraction here is the Avila Hot Springs. Soak away your worries in its natural mineral water pools while palms wave in the gentle breeze. Then treat yourself to a locally-sourced seafood dinner - like Dungeness crab - at Olde Port Inn or Ocean Grill. Top off your divine day with a bonfire at Olde Port Beach.

To the south of Avila Beach, you'll quickly reach the larger Pismo Beach. In this area, your family can have a tranquil moment at the Monarch Butterfly Grove or take a thrilling ATV ride at the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area. A bit further south is Santa Barbara for urban attractions like luxury shopping.

Northbound, you'll find another quaint ocean-side town, Morro Bay, as well as Montana de Oro State Park. Both have many scenic hikes and photo-worthy vistas.

Inland, you'll quickly get to San Luis Obispo, a quiet town where you can enjoy a drive-in movie at the Sunset. On the way, you might want to experience the eccentric decor at the Madonna Inn. Did you book one of our Avila Beach vacation rentals for a trip with your gal pals or for a couples' escape? Beyond the town is Paso Robles, Central California's famed wine country. Be sure to bring home an award-winning vintage to enjoy at your home away from home!

Avila Beach has significantly grown in the last 20 years, and it's only going to continue attracting beach-loving visitors needing to get away from it all...but still remains just off the beaten track! Start planning today and secure your Central Coast vacation rental in this must-visit town!

After admiring the coast, it's worth venturing inland to some of Sonoma County's small towns. A scenic drive on the exotically named Bohemian Highway takes you 20 minutes away to Occidental, which offers cute cafes luxurious day spas. Go antiquing at the adorable Duncan Mills on California 116. It might be hard to resist wine country, but you don't have to venture too far east to find visit-worthy wineries.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Cambria/
From the dreamily dubbed Moonstone Beach to the quirky Nitt Witt Ridge, Cambria is a Central California Coast destination for the free spirited and fun-seeking families alike. Plan a relaxing beach escape slightly off the beaten path and stay at one of our cozy Cambria vacation rentals.

Stretched out over eight-and-a-half square miles on scenic route Highway 1 and halfway between Monterey Bay and Santa Barbara, Cambria is one of the prettiest towns in California. Its closest major metropolitan area is Fresno, 135 miles northeast, but this village is easily accessible via many state and US routes, as well as the San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport.

With miles of coastline, native Monterey pine groves, and wandering wild turkeys, this seaside town of roughly 6,000 friendly residents is all about the beach habitat. Nature thrives here among the protected areas, including the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve with its coastal Bluff Trail, Cambria State Marine Park where snorkelers and kayakers can observe seals, and White Rock State Marine Conservation Area, at which researchers study the rich inter-tidal zones.

For a relaxing Cali coast experience, go to Moonstone Beach. Bring snacks from the year-round Cambria Farmer's Market or fill up on brunch at Moonstone Bar and Grill at the southern end since you'll likely get lost in moments spent meandering the well-maintained boardwalk, combing for semi-precious jasper, and holding hands on the many benches. Make your way to Leffingwell Landing to search for whales and surfers as the wind whirls scents of fragrant flora all around you. Leffingwell Landing is part of Hearst San Simeon State Park, which includes a gorgeous beach hike along the ocean bluffs.

Why not tour the Piedras Blancas Light Station? This Pacific lighthouse first guided sailors in 1875 and still shines today. Just a mile south is the largest elephant seal rookery on the US west coast. Observe the mighty marine mammals safely from the large parking lot or boardwalk. After all of this exploring, you’ll be grateful for the comfy beds at your Cambria beach house.

Unique Cambria attractions include Nitt Witt Ridge, a folk art destination that could only exist in California. The Pewter Plough Playhouse is considered a hidden gem. Share in coastal Californian cuisine at Cambria restaurants from the sophisticated Black Cat Bistro to the rustic Boni’s Tacos food truck. Craving craft beer? Grab a seat at Cambria Beer Company. With Paso Robles wine country just over 30 miles east, you'll be inspired to hang out at the Moonstone Cellars tasting room. Bring home a bottle to pop and share at any of our Cambria vacation rentals!

As part of San Luis Obispo County, Cambria is surrounded by other beach hamlets and Central California towns. An easygoing day trip from Cambria could start with homemade breakfast in your vacation rental then a jaunt south on Highway 1. Stop to stretch your legs in the "old west" town of Cayucos and pick up sweets at Brown Butter Cookie Company. Continue onto Morro Bay for lunch and a stroll on its dog-friendly beach, crowned by the impossible-to-miss Morro Rock. From Morro Bay, Highway 1 leads inland toward the county seat, San Luis Obispo. Stroll downtown and stay for a movie at the Art Deco Fremont Theater or Sunset Drive-In.

Northeast of Cambria is Lake Nacimiento for boating and swimming. Unlike the frigid and rough Pacific waves that only surfers and sea otters dare to tackle, Lake Nacimiento allows you to get down to your bikini and swim under the hot sun. Rent stand-up paddle boards or go for a speedy raft ride.

Get to know or reacquaint yourself with California through one of our Cambria vacation rentals for a getaway filled with beautiful beach vistas and wildlife.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Brockway/

Perched at the tip of the peninsula between Agate and Crystal bays, Brockway, CA is next door to Kings Beach, a popular destination in its own right.

Formerly known as Hot Springs, Brockway is home to the only natural hot water springs in Tahoe. Treat yourself to a massage followed by a soak in Earth’s own hot tub!

#Pathname:/usa/California/Carpinteria/
Located along the stunning oceanside in Santa Barbara County, a Southern California vacation rental in sleepy Carpinteria offers a quiet, charming beach community with good surfing swells, as well as peaceful calm waves and a long, sandy beach.

From here you can explore bluff trails for an afternoon stroll - but keep your eyes open, you might just see seals, sea lions, and perhaps even grey whales! At only 11 miles east of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria makes a great home-base for exploring this beautiful, sun-drenched region of California. When you leave your beach bungalow, head to the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve for bird watching, the state beach for surfing, or Carpinteria Bluffs Nature Preserve for a day of hiking. And if you visit in August, you'll be in town for the annual California Avocado Festival - three days of live music (four stages), avocado-themed contests (hello, largest avocado), and of course the best guacamole!

From here, you can head west along the coast to Santa Barbara for wine tasting or further southeast to spend time in the neighboring town of Ventura. Although you could opt for a scenic afternoon drive along Highway 101, if you stay put in town you can enjoy a sunny afternoon looking for shells along the beach and working up an appetite. Popular restaurants right in town include Zookers for banana-crusted salmon or the Worker Bee Cafe hearty breakfasts, lunches, and coffee drinks. Of course, at your Carpinteria vacation cottage you'll have a full kitchen to whip up your own culinary creations! Maybe fish tacos on the patio or a vegetarian lasagna and a glass of red wine on a chilly coastal evening.

Visit this charming California beach town with an unforgettable stay at one of our comfortable and well-stocked Carpinteria vacation rentals for fun and sun year-round!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Carmel-by-the-Sea/
Our Carmel-by-the-Sea vacation rentals make a lovely home base for your next Central California Coast getaway. Carmel, California is also known as Carmel-by-the-Sea, and this quiet community offers beautiful beach vistas...and is especially dog-friendly!

Resting on the Monterey Peninsula, Carmel-by-the-Sea is just over a two-hour drive south from San Francisco. Below its cypress-covered hills and upscale homes is the scenic Carmel Bay. Just to the north, you can easily reach the family-friendly Monterey and the youthful Santa Cruz. This entire region offers a range of coastal atmospheres, so there's something for everyone!

Perhaps the best way to experience this hamlet is on foot, which is easy in Carmel. This place loves dogs, and many of the local businesses and outdoor attractions are pet-friendly. There are even restaurants offering dog menus!

Start by grabbing a latte for some window shopping at Carmel Village along Ocean Avenue, where many merchants welcome dogs. At the end of this street, you'll find yourself at the Scenic Road Walkway, a pedestrian-only path opening to views of the bay. Bring your camera!

Experience even more memorable scenes on the 17 Mile Drive, a coastal car and bike route accessible from Carmel. It winds through several visit-worthy points 600 feet above the shore, like the often-photographed Lone Cypress that has stood above Pebble Beach for 250 years. When you park your car to take in the views, you may spot a harbor seal in the surf - only to turn around and see mule deer grazing in succulent patches.

Carmel is also known for its rich arts history as many American writers, photographers, and actors lived in the area since the early 20th century. At the outdoor Forest Theater you can see the annual Carmel Shakespeare Festival. The Tor House hosts literary events and tours to commemorate its former resident, California poet Robinson Jeffers. Perhaps Carmel's most famous citizen is its former mayor, Clint Eastwood.

Just about a 20 minute drive north of our Carmel-by-the-Sea vacation rentals is Monterey where you'll find many family-friendly attractions. Perhaps the most well-known is the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a magnificent indoor and outdoor exhibition displaying and supporting California's coastal and ocean wildlife. It's conveniently located on Cannery Row, alongside restaurants and shops.

In the summer months, you may enjoy a jaunt farther north along Monterey Bay to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk. Here, you and your family can enjoy a charming amusement park right within steps of the beach.

Our Carmel-by-the-Sea vacation rentals will allow you to relax in a private setting while exploring one of the most beautiful and visitor-friendly regions of the California coast. Where will you stay?

#Pathname:/usa/California/Elk/
One of the smallest towns along the Mendocino coast, little Elk, California is nonetheless big on appeal. A little more quiet and peaceful than its better-known neighboring towns to the north, a stay in one of our Mendocino coast vacation rentals in Elk offers sweeping views and natural splendor along with true relaxation.

Despite its diminutive size, Elk offers some lovely dining options for its lucky visitors. Queenie's Roadhouse Cafe has legendary eggs Benedict, and pub food doesn't get much better than at Bridget Dolan's. For a really unique experience, head up the bluff to the firehouse/dive bar (yes, really) Beacon Light by the Sea for a few laid-back beers and a lot of interesting conversation from the affable owner.

Anything else you might need is within easy reach in the larger towns of Mendocino or Fort Bragg to the north. Of course, the real draw is the coast itself. Rugged cliffs, sweeping vistas, and picturesque sea stacks make this stretch of shoreline a photographer's dream. To get a little closer to the beauty, take an ocean kayak tour, or plan a horseback ride along the beach.

Just north of town is the gorgeous Navarro River Redwoods State Park, a must-visit for a scenic hike under a canopy of old-growth trees. And after a long day of exploration, book a massage at a local spa for a well-deserved treat!

#Pathname:/usa/California/Felton/
Escape to a Felton vacation rental surrounded by peaceful Santa Cruz Mountains on the Central California Coast.

This historic little town off of Highway 17 is a short drive north of the people-filled beaches of Santa Cruz and Aptos, tucked away in the woods between sections of the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park.

An ideal destination for history buffs, Felton boasts an 1892 covered bridge (now designated as a California Landmark), as well as two restored steam trains that meander on tracks to Bear Mountain and the coast along the San Lorenzo River. And for those who like a little cryptozoology on their California getaways, the Bigfoot Discovery Museum is also located right in Felton. Wander exhibits dedicated to Bigfoot sightings and local Felton history.

When you leave your cozy little Felton vacation rental, you may choose to spend the day hiking the nearby Fall Creek Trail at Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. This serene area of the park features a wild canyon, ferns, second generation redwoods, and maple trees. After you've worked up an appetite, you'll be happy to know that Felton has its share of dining destinations in the charming downtown area. There's the family-owned Cowboy Bar & Grill for meat-centric dining, Redwood Pizzeria for organic pies, and Taqueria Vallarta for all meals, breakfast through dinner.

The Santa Cruz mountains are home to a number of wineries, including Hallcrest Vineyards, Dancing Creek Winery, and Beauregard Vineyards. Spend the afternoon tasting and return home with a bottle of Zinfandel Beauregard Ranch to go with dinner. And speaking of meal preparation while on vacation, Felton even serves as the Tuesday location of the popular Santa Cruz Farmers Market - so you can also pick up produce and artisan-made goods to go with your locally-produced wine for a special meal back at your Felton vacation rental.

Leave the hubbub of the busy Bay Area behind with a peaceful retreat to the redwoods.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Fort-Bragg/
Fort Bragg, with a newly revitalized downtown and a decidedly hippie bent, is the laid-back commercial center along the Mendocino coast. For the most relaxing getaway, reserve one of our lovely Fort Bragg vacation rentals: from cooking your own meals to soaking in your private hot tub, there's no better way to experience this unique California town!

Fort Bragg is a military town only in the historic sense: in 1857, it was established as a military outpost that was abandoned within a decade (that other Fort Bragg is in North Carolina). Today, Fort Bragg's order of business is primarily tourism. With over 7,000 year-round residents, it's the largest town along the Coast, and home to the highest concentration of shops, restaurants, and other services in the area... but surrounded by peaceful beaches and hiking trails to explore.

The downtown area is a lovely spot to while away the occasional rainy day. Stop by Headlands Coffee for a latte to sip as you wander among the unique shops and galleries: downtown Fort Bragg is home to everything from a specialty sock store to a tattoo museum and a fantastic art collective. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants to keep you well-fed, along with North Coast Brewing Company and the excellent Roundman's Smoke House for smoked sausages, fish, and cheeses of all kinds.

Pack up your picnic supplies and head for the great outdoors! Nature lovers of all types will find the perfect afternoon activity in and around Fort Bragg. The Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens are just south of town, a beautiful cliff-top hideout of flowers, streams, picnic areas, and walking trails. Fishermen and kayakers will find plenty of spots to launch a boat or drop a line, thanks to the two creeks that flank downtown and the numerous sea caves and quiet bays lining the coast.

Just north of town is MacKerricher State Park, with miles of trails suitable for hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. And, of course, there are plenty of smaller villages and hamlets to explore during your stay. Charming Mendocino is just 15 minutes south, and the more rural hamlets of Albion and Elk, California are within a 40-minute drive as well. Each offers its own unique take on the peaceful, laid-back pace of life that epitomizes the Coast.

For those who want to explore the Mendocino coast without getting too far away from it all, consider booking one of our Fort Bragg vacation rentals today.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Gualala/
Escape the everyday by making plans to stay at one of our Gualala vacation rentals. Quiet and quaint, this small town on the Northern California Coast welcomes with friendly locals and beautiful natural vistas.

Sitting along California Highway 1 on the Pacific coast, Gualala is easily reached from US 101. It's south of Mendocino, Albion, and Elk, with Sonoma County bordering just below. At 115 miles north of San Francisco, Gualala is out of reach of the hustle and bustle of the Bay Area. Over the coastal ridges to the east is Northern California wine country; its neighbors are the similarly quiet Anchor Bay and Sea Ranch.

Say it aloud - "wha-la-la." That's how this seaside gem is pronounced, and it's just as delightful to visit as it is to say. The name comes from a Kashaya Pomo phrase that refers to the downward flow of the Gualala River into the ocean, which is a spot where gray whales migrate two each year.

Start off your day whenever you want, because there's no reason to be in a hurry here! Fix yourself a fabulous breakfast in the kitchen of your Gualala vacation home, then take your pick from relaxing and revitalizing activities like biking, fishing, and golfing at Sea Ranch Golf Links.

Explore the small town's natural beauty on foot via the Gualala Bluff Trail, a newer path with stellar sea views. Look at herons or hummingbirds, and don't forget your camera. Dip your feet or take your dogs for a swim in the river. Visit Gualala Riverwood Park and look up at towering California Redwoods. There are also many trails just a few miles south in nearby Sea Ranch.

Gualala restaurants are often warm and comforting, offering casual dining with a laid back attitude. Visit Trinks Cafe during the day for fresh sandwiches and coffee or come in the evening for one of their specialty weeknight dinners. After a day exploring, you'll return to one of our Gualala vacation rentals happy!

The Northern California Coast is all about escaping the hustle and bustle of the state's crowded cities. It's rustic and wild, yet serene at the same time. If you're looking for a taste of sophistication, take a day trip inland to heaven - a.k.a. wine country.

Get up early and take a leisurely drive south on California Highway 1, then turn east onto State Route 116 toward Duncan Mills, a charming village offering Cape Fear Cafe for a nice breakfast, as well as vintage shops and art galleries. Continue on 116 toward Guerneville, home to many must-visit Russian River wineries. Make the most of your drive with a tour at Korbel followed by lunch at their gourmet deli - then bring back a bottle of a local varietal to enjoy at your private seaside lodge.

This small town is a real treat for a weekend getaway or low-key respite during your road trip. Make your visit unforgettable with a stay at one of our Gualala, California vacation rentals!

This area is also a fantastic place to go birding, and the nearby Big Morongo Canyon Preserve is known for its diverse avian population.

We offer Homewood vacation rentals that make ideal ski retreats and home bases for groups of families and friends looking to explore the natural charm and lush forests of Tahoe's West Shore.

Exuding an old-Tahoe mountain rustic appeal, with the added comfort of modern amenities, our vacation homes will put you within minutes to fantastic skiing at Homewood Resort, ranked one of the top 10 ski resorts in California/Nevada by SKI magazine in 2012. Homewood's topography has made it renowned for its "peak to shore" skiing with mountains so close to the lake they seem to rise up right out of the water. Homewood Mountain resort offers 1,260 skiable acres and eight lifts, each with breathtaking and unobstructed lake vistas to accompany you downhill. Sheltered from high-range winds thanks to towering Ellis Peak, and with a handful of old-growth forest glade runs, the resort is a true Tahoe treasure.

While skiing may be the main draw in the winter, Lake Tahoe summers offer endless options for outdoor recreation. From your Homewood vacation rental, enjoy easy access to an extensive paved trail system that follows the lake all the way to Meeks Bay to the south, Tahoe City and Dollar Point to the north, and further along the Truckee River to Squaw Valley, encouraging runners, walkers, bikers, and rollerbladers to explore the North and West Shores more fully. Blackwood Canyon is just a mile north, offering a two and a half mile flat paved road for even more exploration - and converts to a great cross-country skiing trail when the snow hits.

Be sure to check out the West Shore Cafe across from the resort for a relaxing lake view dining experience and some live music out on the deck in summertime. For a more extensive dining, shopping, and entertainment opportunities, head five miles north to Tahoe City where you'll find a little bit of something for everyone.

Just a short bike ride or drive away from your Little River beach cottage, you can easily spend the day browsing galleries in neighboring Mendocino or pull up a bar stool for a pint of Red Tail Ale at Mendocino Brewing Co. - the first brew pub in California! If beer's not your thing, just to the southeast of Little River there are more than a dozen wineries along state route 128, for a day of wine tasting.

Take your dog for a run at the pet-friendly Toro Canyon Park just east of town. For a truly unforgettable experience, plan a day around venturing out to Channel Islands National Park, an isolated nature preserve accessible by boat or private plane.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Monterey/
Families and couples alike will experience an unforgettable getaway when you stay in one of our Monterey vacation rentals. If you're looking for a historic Central California Coast town brimming with magnificent marine wildlife, look no further!

This friendly coastal town is perched on the southern curve of its namesake bay. A leisurely road trip on California Highway 1 from San Francisco will get you there in under three hours. It shares a charming seaside character with its neighbors Santa Cruz, Pebble Beach, and Carmel-by-the-Sea, but stands out among them as one of the most visit-worthy spots on the California coast.

If you're staying in one of our Monterey vacation rentals, chances are you're planning a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. If not, you should! It beautifully showcases 35,000 different marine animals and plants, many native to the dense underwater kelp forests in Monterey Bay itself.

Try to go on a weekday to avoid crowds, and make sure you check the aquarium's schedule for free volunteer and marine biologist talks about exhibits. Fun fact: this site was prominently featured in the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home!

The aquarium is located on Cannery Row, which you may know from John Steinbeck's novel that captures the sardine cannery culture that once dominated the area in the 1930s. Today, it's a popular destination for boutique shopping and restaurants serving fresh Dungeness crab. Live music often plays in Cannery Row's Steinbeck Plaza, where you'll find a bronze bust commemorating the influential American author.

You might want to set aside a day for whale watching on a charter launched from Fisherman's Wharf. Here, you'll also find eateries ranging from rustic seafood stands and chowder houses to charming trattorias.

Top off your day with a stroll along soft sands on Del Monte Beach or Monterey State Beach where you can spot sea urchins and starfish in its tide pools.

Discover more memorable ocean vistas with visits to nearby Pebble Beach and Carmel-by-the Sea. To reach these quiet sites, take the scenic 17 Mile Drive south - an attraction in itself!

Make a pit stop for coffee or shopping in Carmel Village. If you brought your dog along, he'll be welcome by many Carmel merchants, as it's an especially dog-friendly town.

For thrills and spills on a classic beach boardwalk, head north on Highway 1 to Santa Cruz. Families will enjoy the quaint amusement park, while adults can watch a free summer concert at night.

Inland about half an hour, and right off of US 101 is Salinas. Here, you can take a fuller literary tour by visiting the National Steinbeck Center and the Steinbeck House, which features a restaurant in the author's boyhood home.

Monterey offers so much in family-friendly attractions and memorable moments for everyone. Plan to make a stop there during your California excursion and stay at one of our cozy Monterey vacation rentals!

#Pathname:/usa/California/Morro-Bay/
For a Central California Coast adventure where you can explore unique terrain, observe marine animals up close, and experience local wines and foods, one of our Morro Bay vacation rentals will make a great home base.

You'll find this friendly small town sitting right on the Pacific Coast, halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a part of San Luis Obispo County, it's also close to a handful of quaint hamlets. You can easily reach the town via scenic California Highway 1 along the coast, and you'll immediately notice it by the distinct volcanic landmass Morro Rock, from which the town gets its name.

At just over 10 square miles, there is a wide variety of both urban and outdoor activities in the area. On or around the Embarcadero on the east side of the bay, you'll find your choice of antique stores, cafes, and boutiques. Families and those looking for a unique stop might enjoy the Morro Bay Skateboard Museum. There are many fine dining options for a nice evening out, such as Windows on the Water and the Galley Seafood Grill and Bar. After dinner, why not see what's playing at the mid-century style Bay Theater?

See what you can catch with a fishing trip through Virg's Landing. If you prefer to observe wildlife, take a charter expedition with Sub Sea Tours where you might spot humpbacks, gray whales, and dolphins. For a more personal exploration of the bay, rent kayaks or simply take a nature stroll on the beach. North Point Beach is actually dog friendly.

As one of the Nine Sisters, a series of volcanic lava necks formed thousands of years ago, Morro Rock stands in the causeway between the ocean and the harbor. Perhaps you'll see its resident gulls, cormorants, and the endangered peregrine falcons. In the tide pools below, look for starfish, hermit crabs, and coral. If you're lucky, you may spot a wild sea otter lounging on a raft of kelp! You could also bring a kite or try out windsurfing at just north of the bay.

If you come during early October, the Morro Bay Harbor Festival highlights the best of the area's food, art, and music. In December, be ready to be dazzled by the town's Lighted Boat Parade.

Inland, less than an hour's drive, are tons of attractions for everyone.

Hikers of all levels could take the trail on Black Hill, another of the Nine Sisters. For sky-high views of the sea, go to Harmony Headlands.

If you like a little car-cruising, there are many spots to stop at inland. In nearby Santa Margarita you can conquer zip-lining and horseback riding; history buffs will enjoy the 18th century mission and museums in San Miguel. While each of these places have wineries worth visiting, the best central California vineyards are found in Paso Robles. Let someone else do the driving by booking a guided tour of the best wineries!

Always dreamed of visiting the California coast? Morro Bay is a quiet little gem to discover the Golden State's sometimes-overlooked areas, and our Morro Bay vacation rentals make a fantastic home base for your next getaway.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Oceano/
Hitch up the dune buggy, because you're about the go off roading in Oceano, CA. After a day tracing sandy slopes, spying monarch butterflies, and horseback riding, you'll want a comfy, private place to rest your head. Our Ocean vacation rentals are just the ticket!

This small Central Coast beach town is home to just over 7,200 residents and neighbor to four other similarly-sized communities - the popular Pismo Beach, the quaint Grover Beach, the rustic Arroyo Grande, and Shell Beach. The closest major metropolitan area is Bakersfield, CA about 130 miles east. Oceano is easily accessed via US 101 or State Route 1.

Perhaps the area's biggest draw is its dunes, which are the only remaining off-road coastal variety in California. Of the 3,500 acres, about 2,000 are reserved for boisterous, bouncing buggies. March through September, this area is reduced due to the nesting season of the endangered snowy plover and California least tern. If you happen to visit in the autumn, look for these sea birds' chicks skittering in the surf - it's really cute.

Not so much into "cute" as you are "extreme?" Strap into your scrappy off-road ride and zoom on the dunes at the State Vehicular Recreational Area (SVRA). If you're visiting nearby Pismo Beach for its laidback vibe, mix things up with an Oceano ATV rental or guided tour. Each October, thousands congregate in this area for Huckfest, a truck-jumping event that boasts being the “gnarliest high-flying off-road action you will ever see.” Horseback riding and hiking on foot are also great ways to experience this unique ecosystem.

Early 20th century residents of these dunes included utopia-seekers, free spirits, and artists who believed they could channel the wild energy harnessed in this area. Perhaps you'll catch some of these frequencies as you sense the rev of an engine.

On the southern end of the dunes is the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center that focuses more on the delicate ecosystem than adventure. Follow one of its naturalists on a guided hike, enrich your mind with its educational programs and exhibits, and get inspired by its art gallery. The center also memorializes the largest film set ever built, that of Cecille B. DeMille's 1923 epic The Ten Commandments. Constructed on the area's dunes, it was eventually dismantled and, according to rumor, hidden in the sands. Fast-forward to 1983 when film buffs discovered the myth to be true and revealed the later named "Lost City of Cecil B. DeMille."

If you're not staying at one of our Oceano vacation rentals, there are other nearby communities offering delightful beach lodging and attractions. The closest are Grover Beach, with its charming atmosphere and annual concert series, and historic Arroyo Grande. No trip to this area is complete without a pilgrimage to the Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove in winter.

Find a new California point of view in this eclectic area while staying at one of our welcoming Oceano vacation rentals.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Pacific-Grove/
If you want seaside splendor, look no further than quaint Pacific Grove, California. The coastal town is a popular base for Central Coast vacation rentals, and with good reason. Dubbed "Butterfly Town U.S.A," visitors flock here for the annual monarch butterfly migration, as well as for its stately Victorian manses and historic lighthouse. Sandwiched between tony Monterey and affluent Pebble Beach, Pacific Grove has a more vintage, homey feel than its more famous neighbors. John Steinbeck, Janis Joplin, and Frank Zappa all called it home, and a tour of the historic downtown harkens back to a bygone era.

With its location on the gorgeous Central Coast, Pacific Grove is a veritable outdoor paradise. From its famed Monarch Grove Sanctuary - best visited between November and February - to the dog-friendly and wheelchair-accessible Asilomar Beach to Point Pinos Lighthouse, built in 1855 and still the oldest continuously operated lighthouse on the West Coast, to its plethora of city parks large and small, visitors will find myriad ways to enjoy the beautiful coastal hills and blue ocean in this charming California town. So, grab a bike and head down the seaside bike trail!

Although in the cultural shadow of Monterey and Carmel-by-the-Sea, Pacific Grove still offers enough places of interest to keep visitors occupied. The historic downtown features a plethora of Victorian homes, most in great condition. The Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History boasts a killer whale skeleton, a native plant garden, and a Central Coast bird collection.

Pacific Grove remains a great base from which to explore the entire Central California Coast. Monterey is just over two miles to the south and boasts the Monterey Bay Aquarium as well as the Monterey Jazz Festival. Less than seven miles away lies picturesque Carmel-by-the-Sea, a town that is often on best of lists for its beach, romantic flavor, and art galleries. World-renowned Pebble Beach is also only minutes away. Head here in February for the annual AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am golf tourney and in April for the Pebble Beach Food & Wine fest.

So, whether it's whale watching from a private charter, admiring butterflies as they progress through life stages, or enjoying a nosh at a seaside eatery, this hidden gem is a great spot to explore the outdoors...and Vacasa offers an ever-growing selection of Pacific Grove vacation rentals to choose from!

#Pathname:/usa/California/Palm-Springs/
Vintage glamour, sunshine, and swimming pools: there's no place quite like Palm Springs.

Treat yourself to the privacy and space of a Palm Springs vacation rental, and find out what it's like to have a home away from home in this carefree destination.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Paso-Robles/
Our Paso Robles vacation rentals will inspire, delight, and enthrall you as much as this lovely city in California's Central Valley. Situated at the foothills of the Santa Lucia Mountains, Paso Robles, California, is one of the state's most desired holiday destinations.

First settled by the Salinan People, the Franciscans arrived in the 1700s, harnessing the power of the natural hot springs and planting the first vineyards in the area. Anglo Europeans arrived in the 1800s to farm the land and tourists soon followed - and have never stopped coming.

Today, Paso Robles is known for its verdant vineyards, olive groves, and hot springs. You can enjoy it all from one of our Paso Robles vacation rentals.

Hot springs are king here and you can still enjoy their therapeutic benefits at two locations. The River Oaks Hot Springs Spa has myriad rooms that offer relaxation in a beautiful setting. Franklin Hot Springs is still in its natural setting and boasts scenic wonder as well as native wildlife such as cinnamon teal ducks, bull frogs, and muskrats.

Built by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Hearst Castle is one of the most visited sites in town. This expansive historic estate, erected in the 1920s, showcases grand rooms and cottages boasting opulent furnishings as well as ancient art that rivals collections found in the world's great museums. Casa Del Mar is one of the most popular spots on the site due to its views of the Central Coast and its elaborate interiors.

The Paso Robles Pioneer Museum highlights the region's history and its founding fathers. Tour historical literature and displays dating back to the 1800s.

Wine is almost as popular as the hot springs, and when you stay in one of our Central Coast vacation rentals in Paso Robles, you'll be conveniently located to many excellent vineyards. With more than 200 wineries in the domain, you'll be sure to buy a case or two for family and friends back home. Proulx is known for its Cab Franc and Merlot. Head to Saxum Vineyards for award-winning blends of Syrah, Grenache, and Mourvèdre. Savor Napa-level Cabernet Sauvignon at L'Aventure Winery.

The Central Valley is resplendent in towns and sites that you'll want to explore.Visit the Montana de Oro State Park outside of San Luis Obispo, where golden flowers bloom in the spring, and guests can enjoy hiking up Valenica Peak or meandering along Spooner's Cove. Pismo Beach is 44 miles away and offers spots to surf as well as the Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove.

Soak away your troubles and tour world-class vineyards in lovely Paso Robles. Our Paso Robles vacation rentals are your gateway to this Central Valley town!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Pebble-Beach/
Golf fans and ocean lovers alike will love a stay at one of our Pebble Beach vacation rentals. This affluent community is home to the PGE Tour AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, and surrounded by stunning ocean vistas, old-growth Monterey pines, and your choice of Central California Coast attractions.

Easily accessible by scenic California Highway 1, Pebble Beach is nestled between the Monterey and Carmel Bays, just above sea level on the Monterey Peninsula. At under three hours south of San Francisco, an hour north of Big Sur, and next door to the nature habitat area Del Monte Forest, you might think you've slipped into a paradise while in Pebble Beach.

If you spend a lot of time on the green, perhaps you've aspired to play a few rounds at this popular golf destination. At less than 30 square miles in size, Pebble Beach has eight private and public 18-hole courses. From the Del Monte Golf Course (the oldest in operation west of the Mississippi) to Spyglass Hill Golf Course (one of the most challenging in the world!) you'll want to plan multiple visits to Pebble Beach just to cover them all.

Pebble Beach is largely residential (with a few famous folks in the area) and doesn't have sidewalks, so you'll want to have a car while visiting. That said, you'll find many outdoor points of interest while zipping around on your wheels.

Pack your camera and cruise on the 17 Mile Drive. Pay a visit to Pescadero Point to see its enchanting cypresses, dubbed “Ghost Trees.” Both Seal Rock and Bird Rock are viewable from 17 Mile Drive, and bring your binoculars to view their namesake marine life.

While part of your crew will enjoy the green, the rest of you can experience more Monterey Peninsula attractions. On the southern curve of the Monterey Bay, you'll find its biggest town of the same name. There's the Monterey Bay Aquarium on Cannery Row, which is a must-visit for both children and adults.

Have a ladies-only afternoon in Carmel-by-the-Sea on the southern side of the peninsula. Start with a light brunch at a cafe in Carmel Village before a round of shopping. You'll find that many merchants here welcome dogs into their boutiques, so don't leave your furry friend at home (or even back at one of our pet-friendly Pebble Beach vacation rentals!). Then, why not make reservations at one of the many fine restaurants in Carmel?

Even if you're not a seasoned hiker, take a day trip to Big Sur, even if it's just to drive the span of the Bixby Bridge (and snap a photo of the iconic view).

Pebble Beach is the premier California destination for a golf vacation or an unforgettable getaway by the sea. Enjoy it by staying at one of our luxurious Pebble Beach vacation rentals for the best experience of living like a local in this beautiful community.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Pismo-Beach/
Pismo Beach allows you to relive childhood memories at the shore while making new ones with your own family. It's about enjoying time together with a laid back vibe. This Central Coast beach town is where butterflies are free and surfers are happy. Our Pismo Beach vacation rentals will put you in the center of it all.

Though the name may sound familiar, non-Californians may not know where to spot Pismo Beach on the map. It's halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles and is the most prominent of the Five Cities Area of San Luis Obispo County (out of Arroyo Grande, Oceano, Grover Beach, and Shell Beach). Located along a narrow 13.5 square mile stretch on the San Luis Obispo Bay, with US 101 and State Route 1 (a.k.a. Highway 1) merging through most of Pismo Beach, getting in and out is super convenient.

While most beach vacations are taken in the summer, Pismo Beach offers attractions and events year round.

It's worthwhile to take a special trip between November and February to witness the massive monarch butterfly migration. These enchanting creatures take up temporary lodging among the area's eucalyptus trees. Concentrations of them can be observed at the Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove, a great family-friendly attraction.

In June, bring your binculars and claim a spot on the popular 1,200-foot long Pismo Pier for the annual visit from humpback whales. While you patiently wait for one of the massive marine mammals to breach the surface or even leap into the air, watch anglers fish for the occassional halibut.

Surfing in Pismo Beach is a pastime, being that it's on the California Coast. While sightings of the desired barrel waves that come with winter swells entice experienced surfers, beginners can train confidently with the aid of local guides. Standup paddle boarding, sea kayaking, and kite boarding are all nice alternatives for those eager to get out on the water.

Put on your clam diggers and learn how that pant style got its name as you hunt for the famous Pismo Clam. Once known as the "Clam Capital of the World," its beaches were dense with the vitamin-rich shellfish that have the potential to grow bigger than your hand. Due to overharvesting in the 1950s and hungry sea otters today, the Pismo Clam is a bit harder to find, but worth the dig. Make sure to obtain your salt-water fishing licences beforehand.

A serene visit with the butterflies and whales can be paired with a thrilling off-road romp. Rent or bring your own dune buggy to the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area just south of town. In the 1930s and 40s, this area was inhabited by mystics, writers, hermits, and other free spirits dubbed Dunites. It was believed that this unique ecosystem was a center of creative energy. Some level of high energy certainly thrives here today with the buzz and roar of buggies zooming over its slopes.

Frolic around the playground, walk your dog, or even host a wedding at Dinosaur Caves Park. All of these great attractions are within a few miles from our inviting Pismo Beach vacation rentals!

Just south of this admired Central California vacation destination are three little towns worth taking a spin through while staying at a Pismo Beach rental. The closest is Grover Beach, a tiny town with a big heart. Check out their Annual Sizzlin' Summer Concert Series and Farmer's Market. Next up is Arroyo Grande, slightly inland and hosting a Strawberry Festival each Memorial Day weekend. Finally, there's Oceano where you'll discover the dunes.

Thirteen miles northeast is San Luis Obispo, with the eclectic Madonna Inn along the way. Go wild on Instagram while meeting horses, shopping for souvenirs, and snacking on the historic inn’s Pink Champagne cake. The town of San Luis Obispo has a friendly collection of eateries and boutiques, plus cool vintage-style movie theaters like the Fremont and the Sunset Drive-In.

A short hop north on 101 gets you to Avila Beach and Avila Hot Springs, a must-visit spot to ease your tired clam-digging muscles under the shade of palm trees.

If you haven't already adopted the laid-back attitude California exudes, do so while staying at one of our Pismo Beach vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Rancho-Santa-Fe/
For the finest San Diego vacation rentals, look no further than beautiful Rancho Santa Fe! This highly desirable and exclusive community about 26 miles north of San Diego offers easy access to all the attractions of its larger neighbor to the south, but with a more secluded and scenic setting in the hills northeast of the city. At just about 11 miles from Escondido, the community of Rancho Santa Fe offers beautifully manicured landscaping, impeccably-groomed homes, and million-dollar views of the countryside below.

It's easy to see why celebrities and politicians of all stripes have long called Rancho Santa Fe their home.

#Pathname:/usa/California/San-Luis-Obispo/
If you'll be exploring the Central California Coast, our selection of San Luis Obispo vacation rentals offer short drives to the shore, the vineyards, and much more!

This charming city is centrally located near US 101, about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles and only 10 miles east of the Pacific Ocean. Home to California Polytechnic State University and near the world-famous Paso Robles wine country, the town was established way back in 1772.

With roughly 13 square miles of verdant valleys, hardy Mediterranean flora, and easily accessible urban attractions, San Luis Obispo is a great home base for your Central Coast vacation. Start your day off with a Cali breakfast of avocados and eggs at one of many cafes in the pedestrian-friendly downtown. Dive into the city's past at the San Luis Obispo County Historical Museum and the nearly 250 year-old, still-functioning Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa. For a more offbeat experience, stroll by Bubblegum Alley...which is exactly as it sounds!

A few minutes' drive from downtown, you'll find the eccentric Madonna Inn, a baroque-inspired resort founded in 1958 that will please aspiring and professional photographers alike. If Art Deco and mid-century modern are more your style, catch a current release at the Fremont Theater or the retro-inspired Sunset Drive-In.

For both visitors and residents of Golden State, a road trip on Highway One is a must! Pick up the shoreline road near our San Luis Obispo vacation rentals and meet the Pacific at Morro Bay. On your way, you'll find El Chorro Regional Park for short hikes, birdwatching, and fishing. Once you reach the bay, grab local a seafood or fresh Mexican lunch for a beach picnic and take a moment to admire Morro Rock's peregrine falcons.

From Morro Bay, you could head north to San Simeon for the Piedras Blancas Elephant Seal Rookery, or a visit to the Hearst Castle on the publishing tycoon's La Cuesta Encantada estate. If you swing south, you'll find Montana de Oro State Park where you can windsurf, ride horses on the beach, or just take a stroll alongside grazing sandpipers. Part of your day-long adventure is in fact the scenic drive on top of seaside bluffs adorned with orange poppies and feathery pampus grass. It's a trip you'll never forget!

If you're visiting this area, chances are you came for the wines! Paso Robles (about 30 minutes away from downtown San Luis Obispo), thrives on 26,000 acres of vines and is known for its quintessentially California Zinfandels and Rhône-style vintages.

Don't know where to start? Book a guided tour so that everyone in your group can partake in tastings. If you have a designated driver, you could plan a fast and loose itinerary on the suggestions of friendly locals. Don't overlook the region's olive oils and honeys from bees that pollinate its almond groves. Then, finish your day with dinner at one of the top-notch restaurants in downtown Paso Robles.

While California is known for its world-class metropolises, it also holds a wealth of small urban gems like this one. When you choose to make your home base here, you'll find lovely San Luis Obispo vacation rentals you won't want to leave!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Santa-Barbara/
Located two hours north from Los Angeles on the longest east-west trending section of coastline on the West Coast is the beautiful city of Santa Barbara, a.k.a., "The American Riviera." The perfect spot for a Southern California Coast vacation rental, Santa Barbara is nestled in the gorgeous Ynez Valley and flanked on the south by the Pacific Ocean, Santa Barbara's climate - with 300 days of sunshine, annual rainfall of 15 inches, and average yearly temperature of 64 degrees - is reminiscent of its European counterpart. This stellar weather is linked to its east-west orientation, an alignment that moderates the ocean currents as they pass by. Also, mountains to the north and the Channel Islands 20 miles offshore also mitigate the weather. Whatever the reasons, the climate is great, making the area a magnet for vacationers seeking the perfect environment for outdoor activities.

But Santa Barbara isn't just about the weather. Though, like the French Riviera, it has a reputation as a playground for the wealthy, the average income for residents of Santa Barbara is only slightly higher than average California income. Families won't need a yacht or a limousine to enjoy the city's Zoological and Botanic Gardens, or the Museum of Art. Take the "Red Tile Walking Tour," a self-guided tour of many landmarks. (Factoid: A city ordinance makes it mandatory for buildings to comply with the dominant Mission theme of adobe architecture and red-tiled roofs).

There's also Santa Barbara's historic Stearns Wharf, California's oldest working wharf. Built in 1832 to serve cargo and passenger ships, the wharf is home today to shops, restaurants, and the Ty Warner Sea Center, an interactive marine facility that puts you up close and personal to the nearby marine life! And when you're done exploring, pull up a chair at one of the 283 eateries in the area that serve everything from Mexican to, of course, seafood. Considering Santa Barbara's wonderful climate, it's no surprise that there's plenty to do outdoors!

Right near your Santa Barbara beach cottage, there are four beaches in the area: East Beach, West Beach, Leadbetter and Butterfly. Hikers can choose from trails overlooking the ocean, trails starting at the crest of the Santa Ynez Mountains and in the Ynez Valley, and trails along the beach. Or, sign on to cruise where you can watch the sunset or whales frolic. Golfers: Santa Barbara has six public, 18 hole golf courses, four of which are within a half-hour of the city. Each exploits some natural feature of the area - ocean, mountain, or river - and all enjoy year-'round play afforded by the climate. And don't forget: Santa Barbara is wine country! There are a number of wineries within blocks of Downtown Santa Barbara where you can take a tour or tempt your palate with a tasting. A stay in a Santa Barbara vacation rental any time of year promises lots of fun in a year-'round great climate!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Sebastopol/
Sebastopol, CA is infused daily by cool fog drifting in from the Pacific. That makes for great pinot noirs, but there’s so much more than wine country here. Stay at one of our Sebastopol vacation rentals and find out what you’ve been missing.

As one of the boundaries of the Green Valley, a Sonoma County American Viticultural Area where over 100 wineries take root in the soil, Sebastopol is about 50 miles north of the San Francisco Bay Area and 100 miles west of Sacramento. Locals call this area West County, describing its closer proximity to the coast in relation to the more heavily toured Sonoma Valley to the east. Weary workers from nearby metropolitan areas are lured here by the embrace of the sun, the chill of the fog, and the promise of experiencing the terroir through remarkable food and wine.

Being the foggiest region of Sonoma County, Sebastopol once thrived on apple and plum groves. Today grape vines have taken over with pinot noir ruling and chardonnay, gewürztraminer, and zinfandel close behind.

Start your tasting tour at one of the premier Green Valley wineries, Dutton Estate. The family of this winery started with growing apples in the 1920s. DeLoach Vineyards features the area's mainstays as well as zippy zinfandels with a focus on small batches and biodynamic farming. Miramar Estate also utilizes biodynamic organic farming. For a switch from rich pinots and chardonnays, partake in the crisp, sparkling cuvées and bruts at Iron Horse Vineyards.

There are so many great tasting rooms within a 10-mile radius of our Sebastopol vacation rentals, it might be hard to know where to begin! Have a professional escort you through the narrow country roads. Try California Rivers Wine Tours or the luxe Executive Charters & Limousine that will happily chauffeur your Sonoma wine country wedding party. Go for one that will pick you up at your Sebastopol vacation home if you can.

Before you head out on your winery road trip, fuel up on local fare at the many fantastic Sebastopol restaurants. Start with a fortifying brunch at Hole in the Wall Restaurant, serving California comfort food. Savor an Instagram-worthy meal at French Garden, which serves produce harvested daily.

Sebastopol has a modest population of under 8,000, but it sure isn't a sleepy bedroom community. Nightlife and live music are easily found. Go to Aubergine Vintage Emporium and Cafe - a thrift shop by day and a pumping club by night under the name 755 After Dark. Get dinner and drinks, then get down at Hopmonk Tavern. French Garden also has a music schedule.

Ready for dinner? Peter Lowell's Restaurant offers California-inspired Italian cuisine from local ingredients. To match your dessert wine, pick up sweets at Sonoma Chocolatiers. Then again, you can always swing by the year-round Sebastopol Farmer's Market for fresh fruits, veggies, meats, and cheeses to fix a fine feast at your Sonoma County vacation rental.

Sebastopol remembers its history by hosting the "sweetest little fair in Sonoma County," the Gravenstein Apple Festival every August and the Apple Blossom Festival each April.

Take a break from wine with the many Northern California breweries in the cute towns dotting US 101. A short seven to eight mile drive east of Sebastopol is Santa Rosa. Go to Russian River Brewing Company for hoppy ales and barrel-aged micros (be sure to get in line early for a table). Further south on 101 is the community of Petaluma where you'll find Lagunitas Brewing Company and the taproom at Petaluma Hills Brewing Company.

For a unique family-friendly Sonoma County attraction, go to Rancho Obi-Wan, known as a mecca for Star Wars fans. In between Santa Rosa and Petaluma is the Graton Resort and Casino where retirees congregate before slot machines - so save up your dollar bills and take a chance at the jackpot.

Need to ease your feet into the sea? Just 15 miles west of our Sebastopol vacation rentals quietly lies Bodega Bay, a charming coastal town where your ocean fix will be fulfilled. Explore tide pools at Doran Beach or play a round of golf on The Links at Bodega Harbour.

Take a scenic drive on California State Route 116 across Green Valley to Guerneville, which sits along the Russian River. Rent a kayak to explore robust sections of the river or hike through Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve.

Wherever you roam throughout the Northern California Coast, let our Sebastopol vacation rentals be your home away from home!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Santa-Cruz/
Beautiful beaches with resident surfers, lively vintage boardwalks, and a diverse community of eco-friendly outdoor lovers - you'll find a one-of-a-kind experience waiting when you live like a local in one of our Santa Cruz vacation rentals. A college town (home to University of California Santa Cruz) perched on the northern edge of Monterey Bay, this is a vibrant and totally unique destination along the Central California Coast.

Nowhere else will you find such a colorful city in such close proximity to the redwood forests and the shining sea! Spend a day hiking in the state parks that surround Santa Cruz to the north and the west, or head to the vintage boardwalk downtown to ride the roller coaster, take a spin on the carousel, or just soak up the lively beachfront scene. Take a surfing lesson or a guided sea kayak tour, or keep dry while touring the booming wine region just outside the city.

In the evening, head to the eclectic downtown scene: between watching street performers, shopping at local boutiques, and dining on any cuisine you might desire (from sushi to old-school Italian), it's sure to be a fascinating night!

Any time you stay in a Santa Cruz vacation rental, you're sure to find adventure waiting just beyond your door. The only question is... what are you waiting for?
#Pathname:/usa/California/Sonoma/
Imagine yourself surrounded by award-winning wineries nestled between the Napa Valley to the east and the Northern California Coast to the west in one of our deluxe Sonoma vacation rentals. This hub of eco-tourism boasts a popular, historic plaza right in the center of town. The capital of "slow culture," Sonoma is an idyllic place to take in the sights of rolling hills lined with flourishing vines, visit an outdoor cafe with a carafe of wine, or just walk along the cobblestones on a perfect sunny day.

Considered responsible for igniting California’s wine industry in the 19th century, Sonoma county is endowed with one of the most diverse vine-friendly terrains in the country. From the dry hills of the Carneros appellation on its eastern border to the home of old vine Zinfandels in the central Russian River Valley, and finally to the wind-beaten headlands of the Sonoma Coast, this New World wine region is truly enigmatic.

Within a few miles from your Sonoma lodging, you can sample varietals at more than 70 wineries throughout Sonoma county, including award-winning reds at Kenwood Vineyards, those from ancient vines at Ravenswood, and the sustainably farmed vinos of Sebastiani.

If you know what you like, buy a bottle, a wedge of Cowgirl Creamery brie, and charcuterie to enjoy on site at some of the best picnic-worthy wineries such as Gloria Ferrer (specializing in sparkling only), Kunde, and Cohn.

Having a designated driver willing to take you on a Sonoma wine country tour is a priority, but purchasing a professional guide to take the wheel allows everyone in your group to participate in the fun. Consider Valley Wine Tours (ask for Bob), Terrific Tours, or the Sonoma Valley Wine Trolley. Ask if they’ll pick you up right from any of our Sonoma vacation rentals. For a one-of-a-kind adventure, take a hot air balloon ride high above the vineyards.

The only thing better than discovering a new favorite Sonoma wine is experiencing it with a phenomenal meal. With Northern California’s Mediterranean climate, fresh produce and healthy livestock are abundant. Award-winning chefs invite locals and tourists alike to share in the bounty!

You can’t go wrong by picking a place at random in Sonoma Plaza, the small city’s downtown square. Reservations are best, however, for a full dining experience at such gems as The Girl & the Fig and Harvest Moon Cafe.

If wine isn't your thing, Carneros Brewing Company has a taproom that is open daily, as well as a beer garden for sharing snacks and pints on a relaxing afternoon. Sonoma Springs Brewing Company is a great spot as well. The town is also a hub of unique stores, artisan markets, and art galleries.

Feel the need to burn off all those liquid calories? Outdoor adventurers can take a canoe trip on the nearby Russian River, take a tour of a bee farm, or spend the day in scenic Jack London State Park. At Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, you can hike or horseback ride through beautiful oak and chaparral forests, right past waterfalls and peaceful streams.

From Sonoma, day trips can include San Francisco, the Point Reyes National Seashore, or even the sleepy seaside towns of Gualala and Bodega Bay. And when you get back to your Sonoma vacation rental, you can make dinner and sip souvenir wine in your very own kitchen.

Surrounded by redwoods, wineries, and peaceful hiking and biking trails, Vacasa's Sonoma vacation rentals are in the center of numerous California activities and attractions to pick from.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Soda-Springs/
For a memorable North Lake Tahoe resort getaway, stay at one of our Soda Springs vacation rentals! Established in 1931, Soda Springs Mountain Resort is actually a sister resort to five other resorts in Nevada, Oregon, and Utah. Its stellar reputation and diverse attractions make it easy to stay in one place while on vacation. You'll never run out of outdoor activities in winter.

Located just 12 miles west of historic Truckee and picturesque Donner Lake, Soda Springs is also only one mile from Donner Summit. You can easily access the resort from among the once forbidden heights of the Sierra Nevadas on Interstate 80.

Cross country skiers can indulge their passion at Royal Gorge USA, dubbed the "largest cross country ski resort in the USA." Soda Springs loves kids, and has a number of programs catering especially to them. Children can experience the "best tubing in Tahoe" at Soda Springs' Tube Town. Let them take a sleigh ride over to Planet Snow where, as the resort says, "KIDS RULE." With two lifts and numerous trails, one especially for tubing, grown-ups will have a great time too! And, it will be nice to leave the crowds behind and return to one of our private Soda Springs vacation rentals after a packed day in the snow.

Soda Springs isn't always open in summer, but there are still so many reasons to visit the area after the snow melts. South of Soda Springs in Olympic Valley are Alpine Meadows and Squaw Valley that both offer a full menu of indoor and outdoor fun as well as great vacation rentals for the whole family. If you're looking for accommodations closer to Lake Tahoe itself, consider anything from Tahoma to Kings Beach - they're all spectacular.

Soda Springs vacation rentals offer closeness to resort attractions as well as the privacy of a home away from home. Consider this destination for your next winter break!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Spring-Valley/

Spring Valley, California is located just 11 miles east of San Diego, and perfectly positioned for easy access to the attractions of the big city...but with a pleasantly slower pace. This lovely residential area sits just north of the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge, which offers hundreds of hiking and biking trails and private, ranger-led tours.

When you want to see the sites, it's easy to immerse yourself in the San Diego culture. Visit the oceanfront neighborhood of Mission Beach for world-class surfing and great kayak and paddleboard rentals, or head to Balboa Park for the San Diego Zoo, San Diego History Center, and so much more!

#Pathname:/usa/California/Ventura/
When you book a stay at any one of our Ventura vacation rentals, you'll be able to experience a unique Southern California getaway. Formerly called San Buenaventura (roughly translating into “Saint of Good Fortune”), this SoCal city is a beachfront beauty!

Easily reachable from US 101 and many California state routes, Ventura is located right on the Pacific Ocean, just 66 miles northwest of Los Angeles and 33 miles south of Santa Barbara. Its closest neighbor is Oxnard, and within a 50 mile radius from Ventura, towns like Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, Ojai, and Thousand Oaks offer quiet spots to explore urban attractions or the great outdoors.

At 32.1 square miles of land and water, Ventura is full of hip downtown shopping, exhilarating surfing, and a lively arts scene. More affordable than its luxurious cousin Santa Barbara, our Ventura vacation rentals are perfect for families and young adventurers.

Known for its music scene, this town has a rich past and still-beating heart of live performances. The landmark Majestic Ventura Theater once welcomed The Doors and Ray Charles. Spectators have admired Smokey Robinson and the Grateful Dead at the seaside Ventura County Fairgrounds. If you're feeling inspired, satisfy your inner artist with a visit to Parsons Guitars.

Cultural attractions are abundant here. Get a taste of social history at the Old Mission San Buenaventura or Olivas Adobe. Catch the latest independent releases during the Ventura Film Festival.

Getting around downtown Ventura when you want to shop, eat, and explore is easy. Take the free Harbor Trolley for the 45-minute loop through the business district's healthy mix of vintage thrift stores and high-end boutiques. Get your fill of the region's unique cuisine among local Mexican, East Asian, Hawaiian, and New American eateries.

The trolley will take you to Harbor Village at the shore. From there, you can head for Surfer's Point and watch experts ride the waves, or even sign up for your own lessons. Go on a charter sailboat expedition on the Pacific, or simply work on your tan while cooling off at the breakers. Many beaches here welcome dogs, so reserve a pet-friendly Ventura vacation rental and bring your four-legged friends!

With a Mediterranean climate, Ventura weather is as desirable as it gets for those who love warm, dry days and cool nights. On land, you'll be able to enjoy the Golden State sun while cycling on the Omer Rains Bike Trail. Take a ferry to Channel Islands National Park, then explore the magnificent hiking trails, take a snorkeling expedition, or kayak around the five islands' 175 miles of pristine coastline.

In nearby Oxnard, there are even more beaches (with fewer visitors) to lounge on as well as helicopter and whale watching excursions. If the rev of an engine thrills you, take in a afternoon at the Ventura Raceway!

While a jaunt to Los Angeles would certainly be fun, you'll find fewer crowds, romantic trips, and family-friendly fun in the smaller towns surrounding from our Ventura vacation rentals.

Just under 30 miles away are olive orchards in Ojai where you can sample exquisite oils, then spend the day hiking among cottonwoods and poppies in Rose Valley Falls in Los Padres National Forest.

For a taste of Hollywood without all the bustle, head 45 miles inland to Santa Clarita, a popular filming site for hundreds of television programs and movie sequences. The nearby community of Newhall retains its frontier-style appeal for Western movies - complete with a bison paddock. Each September, Newhall hosts an all-inclusive powwow.

Extend your Native American cultural tour at the Chumash Indian Museum in Thousand Oaks. Then, take advantage of the fair weather with a family walk through Gardens of the World. Cali loves its famous residents and popular heritage, and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley offers eclectic exhibitions of Americana and political history.

Foodies will find Truckee's selection of casual eateries and fine dining spots worth the visit. For a high-end plates are as amazing to look at as they are to eat, make reservations at Stella.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Avon/
Just 13 mins (about 10 miles) from Vail, its more opulent counterpart to the east, Avon, Colorado is located along the Eagle River. Referred to by the indigenous Ute Indians as "the shining mountain," what began as prized hunting grounds for the Indians became, at the hands of settlers, an agricultural center for the production of lettuce. In order to serve markets months after the growing season, farmers would load railroad cars packed with ice from the Minturn Ice House. By 1972, however, neighboring Vail had become a world center for skiing, and Avon likewise made the transition from produce to winter and summer vacation rental fun!

Given Avon Colorado's proximity to two great ski resorts, Vail and Beaver Creek, the endless opportunities for winter sports - skiing, boarding, skating, etc. - go without saying. But summer offers its own treasure trove of activities during your vacation. Not only are there myriad hiking and biking trails in the area, why not go horseback riding or rafting on the Eagle River? Get a bird's eye view of the beautiful landscape with and exciting turn at paragliding. There are also numerous spas and health clubs in the area as well.

Just 13 minutes (about 9 miles southwest of Vail), Beaver Creek was another brainchild of Vail's founder, Peter Seibert who envisioned Beaver Creek as a venue for the 1976 Olympics. It was, however, his successor - oil tycoon, Harry Bass - who brought the idea to fruition in 1980. In 1989 it hosted the World Ski Championship, thereby cementing its reputation as a go-to resort for world-class skiers. Beaver Creek Resort is, in fact, three resorts in one: Arrowhead, Bachelor Gulch, and Beaver Creek Village.

Nestled against the slopes of Beaver Creek Mountain, the resort also boasts a golf course designed by the renowned Robert Trent Jones Jr. Voted "World's Best Resort" by Travel and Leisure in 2012, Beaver Creek's motto is: "Not exactly roughing it."

Covering almost five square miles, the town of Breckenridge has a lot to offer - over 70 restaurants and bars, two Nordic Centers, a golf course, 16 museums and galleries, and the Riverwalk Center Outdoor Amphitheater. Add to that the world famous Breckenridge Ski Resort and it would be hard to plan a more fun-filled Rocky Mountain retreat than one in this charming mountain town of just over 4,500 year-round inhabitants. Like the resort towns of Vail and Beaver Creek in winter, Breckenridge comes alive with cold weather activities including dog sledding, sleigh rides, snowmobiling, and even hot air balloon rides over the majestic winter wonderland scenery. With its ranking as one of the Top 10 Ski Resorts in America, Breckenridge Ski Resort boasts four towering mountain peaks on the Ten Mile Range and over 2,000 varied acres of skiing and snowboarding terrain - whether you seek gently rolling hills or steep chutes.

Besides this popular resort, the Gold Run Nordic Center and the Breckenridge Nordic Center each offer miles of trails for cross-country skiing or snowshoeing. And after a day out on the slopes or trails, you'll love coming back to your private ski cabin, sitting back by the fire and being all warm and cozy. Of course, an adventurous stay in lovely Breckenridge isn't just reserved for the colder months. Summer brings its own set of activities - horseback riding, biking, rock climbing on the granite cliffs overlooking the Arkansas River, and hiking through fields of wildflowers. Honestly, finding something to do anytime of year in a region with over 300 days of sunshine a year is a pretty easy task. And while here, getting around town couldn't be easier either. Just look for the Free Ride! The Free Ride bus serves the town of Breckenridge at no charge, and the neighboring Summit Stage transit system also offers free transportation throughout all of Summit County (including the nearby towns of Blue River and Frisco), making it easy to get from your Breckenridge vacation home to practically anywhere you want to go.

Culturally, Breckenridge has a lot going for it as well. The Breckenridge Backstage Theater puts on year-round theater productions, in September, the Breckenridge Festival of Film brings a little bit of Hollywood to the Colorado mountains, and the Arts District, located near the corner of South Ridge Street and East Washington Avenue is home to live performances, a ceramics studio, arts workshops, and the Riverwalk Performing Arts Center.

From your charming and relaxing Breckenridge vacation rental, you'll be well-located to experience all this resort town has to offer - lattes alongside ham and Swiss croissants at the Mug Shot Cafe, a scenic hike along the six mile Mohawk Lakes trail, jewelry shopping at Two Wild Sisters boutique, an afternoon on the slopes at Breckenridge Ski Resort - the possibilities in Breckenridge are endless.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Blue-River/
A great pick for a Vail / Beaver Creek vacation rental, is peaceful and charming Blue River, Colorado. This location offers a quiet, National Forest-surrounded landscape only a small distance away from it's bustling resort town neighbor Breckenridge to the north. You'd probably guess skiing is a popular pastime around Blue River (and you'd be right), but the summer offers just as many things to do! World class fly fishing can be found right on the actual Blue River - known by the locals as "The Blue." From the Upper Blue north of Breckenridge to the tail water below Lake Dillon, this river is home to an abundance of trout - some up to 24-inches long!

But don't feel like you need to rush out and get some fishing gear and waders as soon as you hit town, because nice weather activities in and around Blue River don't start and end with fishing! There's hiking and biking scenic trails past wildflowers, lakes, and waterfalls, swimming and boating on Lake Dillon, whitewater rafting The Blue, or even just relaxing on the deck of your cozy Blue River vacation home. With over 300 days of sun per year, you'll be able to spend a lot of time outdoors here, even if you need to wear a warm hat and scarf along with your sunglasses.

Of course, one of the most popular attractions near Blue River is Breckenridge Ski Resort. Like Vail and Beaver Creek, this resort attracts skiers from all over the world. Breckenridge boasts over 600 acres of daily groomed trails and almost 3000 acres of total skiable terrain. In addition, right in your backyard around Blue River, you'll have access to plenty of trails for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. You can even try ice fishing on Lake Dillon!

Even though you'll have a kitchen in your Blue River vacation home, no one says you have to use it for anything more than making coffee in the morning and heating up leftovers. While most of the dining options are in Breckenridge, it's only about a five mile drive to all of those eateries. And if you're already in the area skiing, you'll have your pick of restaurants to choose from on the way home. A stop at Salt Creek Steakhouse will result in succulent crab cakes and cowboy rib eye steaks, or hit up the Motherloaded Tavern for your fill of comfort food favorites like mac and cheese and fried chicken while you listen to live music. But for those that do like to cook, a stop at the grocery store is all that's needed for a home cooked meal back at your charming Blue River abode.

At less than a two hour drive from Denver, a stay at a Blue River vacation rental makes a ski getaway, annual fishing trip, or just a retreat with friends and family a memorable, fun-filled vacation experience.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Eagle/
Eagle, Colorado acts as the gateway into Vail Valley with majestic mountain peaks and wide-open skies. It maintains a small-town feel with an upscale flare, and offers its visitors Rocky Mountain vacation rentals with easy access to some of the best skiing, hiking, and biking terrain the entire state of Colorado has to offer.

Tucked into the valley of the Gore Mountain Range, Eagle is surrounded on all sides by the grand-scale beauty of the Rockies. Our Eagle vacation rentals are the perfect home-away-from-home for the adventurous, the outdoorsy, or the world-weary looking for a quiet place to reconnect with nature.

The town of Eagle is bustling with an active Main Street, a renovated shopping district, and plenty of opportunities to let loose and enjoy yourself. This is a community-oriented town, and they will eagerly invite you to join in with their favorite past times, festivals, and celebrations all year round.

"Active" is the verb of Eagle: Bike to Work Day, Yoga in the Park, a quirky bowling alley and, of course, countless trails for Nordic skiing, biking, or cross country running make this a town of movement. Our Eagle vacation rentals will make the perfect resting place for you and your family and/or friends after a busy day bustling about.

A typical day in Eagle would include a visit to one of the local eateries in town, such as Yeti's Grind or Red Canyon Cafe, after a relaxing yoga session at Yoga on Broadway. If it's winter time, you're a car or shuttle ride away from Beaver Creek Ski Resort and Vail Ski Resort, both offering phenomenal terrain, lessons for all ages and levels, and an enthusiastic atmosphere. If it's summer time, hike up one of the many trail heads that start right in town such as Mayer or Abrams Gulch, take a drive to Sylvan Lake State Park, or knock a ball around the green at the Eagle Ranch Golf Club. Perhaps take a trip to the spa - there are two in Eagle, and many more in Beaver Creek and Vail - or take a swim around the Eagle Pool, or hit the Capitol Movie Theater.

Your stay at an Eagle vacation rental will be one of activity: there are trails to explore from Gypsum to Copper Mountain, all along an hour's drive of highway, and all with their own unique charms. Eagle itself welcomes you with open arms and then leaves you to contemplate, to explore, and to relish life. As the common saying goes in the Rockies: "If you're lucky enough to live in the mountains, than you are lucky enough".
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Eagle-Vail/
Located between Avon and Vail in the heart of the Eagle River Valley, Eagle-Vail is home to one of the finest golf courses around, the Eagle Vail Golf Club, as well as a deluxe public pool in the summer and excellent cross country ski trails in winter.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/East-Vail/
After snaking downward over 2, 200 feet from the 10,000 foot summit of Vail Pass, I-70 delivers you into a beautiful and pristine community. Welcome to East Vail - the gateway to Vail Valley. A little rougher around the edges than its glamorous neighbor 5 minutes to the west, it offers the traveler a truly alpine experience. And for skiers, East Vail has a unique challenge not to be found in the smartly manicured runs of Vail Resort down the road.

Majestic and dangerous, the snow-covered caps of the East Vail Chutes are one of the best kept secrets of skiers worldwide. They are an exhilarating and dangerous (check for avalanche conditions) backcountry temptation for more advanced skiers looking for the proverbial unbeaten path. In summer, those same slopes that were dotted with intrepid skiers are home instead to cascading waterfalls. East Vail is less developed, and that's its greatest virtue. Everywhere are the unspoiled advantages that come with the natural beauty of the Vail Valley.

Hiking is, of course, very popular. Among the trails are: Big Horn Creek - length: 3.6 miles one way (moderately difficult); Booth Creek - length: 6 miles one way (difficult); Deluge Creek - length: 4 miles one way and, Deluge Creek Trail: length: 4 miles one way (difficult). And there are many more. Head west 11 miles and go fishing, kayaking, and rafting on the Eagle River. For golfers, it's just 3 minutes to Vail Golf club. And of course there's horseback riding, and even hot air ballooning. Cyclists can choose from 18 different bike paths. And that's just summer! Vail Ski Resort is just a short, 5 minute ride on City of Vail's free bus service.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Edwards/
A bit more removed, yet just 10 minutes to Beaver Creek and 20 to Vail, Edwards offers its scenic Riverwalk dotted with boutique shops, a world-class spa, and upscale dining at exquisite bistros and wine bars. Locals claim their dining scene rivals the top-notch eateries in Vail. Fresh waters, like the nearby Eagle River, will delight fisherman and entice kayakers, rafters and floaters alike.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Grand-Lake/
Grand Lake is the state's largest natural body of water. It would make sense, then, that our Grand Lake vacation rentals offer guests a home-away-from-home in a friendly, down-to-earth lake town rich in culture and activity. These Colorado vacation rentals make for an amazing lakeside, riverside, or mountainside getaway just a short drive from the western edge of Rocky Mountain National Park.

Located at 8,369 feet above sea level at the headwaters of the Colorado River, and rimmed by the Continental Divide and the western forests of Rocky Mountain National Park, our Grand Lake vacation rentals are a gorgeous drive of just over 60 miles from I-70, and 100 miles from Denver.

Our Grand Lake vacation rentals are not just for aquatic recreation, although there's sure to be plenty of that. Home to the world's highest-registered yacht club, the locals of Grand Lake know a thing or two about boats. Canoe or kayak, stand-up paddle board or fish - the lake is the town's playground, particularly in the warm months.

Along the western shore of the lake is the historic boardwalk, where frontier-style architecture takes guests back to the Old West. The boardwalk is lined with more than 60 dining, shopping, and art-viewing options, nearly all locally owned and managed. At night, visit bars and outdoor venues for live music. Buy tickets to the renowned Rocky Mountain Repertory Theatre, or play bingo in Town Park.

For those looking for a bit of wintertime fun, Winter Park is just 36 miles south, Keystone is 88 miles away, and Eldora Mountain Resort in Nederland is 89 miles away. Grand Lake is also known for being the Snowmobiling Capital of Colorado, with over 300 trails, half of which are groomed.

Warm months means hiking, biking, ATV trips, bird-watching, and wildlife viewing. Take a hike to the Shadow Mountain Fire Lookout, offering 360-degree views, or to Cascade Falls, where wildflowers burst into color every summer. For a quieter experience on the water, visit Monarch Lake, a peaceful respite for non-motorized aquatic activities. Just to the northeast, Rocky Mountain National Park is teeming with wildlife, including the Colorado Moose, big horn sheep, and elk. Take your camera - you'll want it!

Our Grand Lake vacation rentals are a place for guests to be completely present, fueled by fresh air and gorgeous views!
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Gypsum/
Head about 37 miles to the west on I-70 from Vail, and you're in the mountain community of Gypsum (population, about 4,000). Though its name comes from the rather unglamorous mineral deposits in the area, little Gypsum is bursting with enthusiasm and is a doorway to all the great activities that come with being smack dab in the middle of the Rocky Mountains. Like a crown, Gypsum sits atop a fertile valley punctuating the mountain chain as it rolls westward. Flanked by Red Mountain and Tenmile Peak, there are miles of 4 x 4 trails, hiking, mountain biking, fishing, horseback riding and cross country skiing trails. A beautiful landscape and a challenging 18-hole course isn't all you'll encounter at Gypsum Creek Golf course. It hosts numerous events like tournaments, concerts, and even a Hawaiian luau. In late spring, all summer, and early fall months before the snow flies, take a drive on scenic Cottonwood Pass to Aspen, Carbondale and Snowmass, about an hour-and-a-half, and 68 gorgeous miles away. In the winter, Vail Valley, Beaver Creek and other ski areas are about 30 minutes to the east on I-70 for winter sports in world-class resorts.

Wintertime activities are abound, especially with Winter Park Resort so near at hand. But snow is not just for skiing on - it's for tubing on, too! Fraser is quite proud of its tubing hills; pick from Fraser's Historic Tubing Hill, or from the nearby hill at Colorado Adventure Park. Several adventure companies offer guided snowmobile tours of the Continental Divide and surrounding national forest. There are sleigh rides - some with hot chocolate, some with rustic fine dining at the end - and dog sledding, too.

When the warm months come, guests won't be able to resist the lush greenery of the Arapaho National Forest, a beautiful location for hiking, hunting, and fishing (proper licensing for hunting and fishing required). Take a hot air balloon ride, a trail ride, a bike ride, have tee time at the Pole Creek Golf Club, or go to the rodeo. Visit the Walk Through History Park, with statues of various (in)famous locals, or the Cozens Ranch Open Space, with over two miles of pedestrian trails.

Throughout the year, guests may take a leisurely stroll down the Fraser River Trail, which is maintained all year for walking, snowshoeing, and Nordic skiing. Visit Hot Sulphur Springs Resort and Spa for a soak in one of the 18 pools (located 26 miles away).

For a glimpse at a more modern era, take a historical tour of the area - many Mancos buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. From your Mancos getaway, head to Rimrock Outfitters and spend the day on horseback, riding through the La Plata Mountains (a small sub-range of the San Juans). Mancos State Park boasts fishing (including yellow perch and rainbow trout) and kayaking on Jackson Gulch Reservoir, wildlife viewing, mountain biking, and in the winter, cross-country skiing.

This part of Mesa Verde Country also boasts gorgeous hiking trails - the Rim Trail just north of town intersects with both the Box Canyon Trail and the Chicken Creek Trail and offers a three mile (one way) moderate hike with gorgeous scenery, especially in the fall when the leaves change to vibrant colors. And if you want to tour the area on four wheels, consider driving some of the "San Juan Skyway" - a 236-mile loop through the San Juan Mountains and the towns of Mancos, Durango, Telluride, and Dolores.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Mt-Crested-Butte/
It’s no mystery why Mt. Crested Butte vacation rentals are some of the most sought-after in Colorado – with superb skiing and snowboarding, beautiful hiking and mountain biking trails, back country, plus all the incredible rivers and creeks available for rafting and swimming, it’s hard to stay away from this beautiful area.

When it comes to the Rocky Mountains’ finest outdoor offerings, it doesn’t get much better than Crested Butte—no matter what time of year! While Colorado is known for its incredible ski areas, Crested Butte Mountain Resort is special because it’s a bit smaller and boasts some of the best powder shredding, stunning panoramic views, and tons of variety for beginner to advanced skiers.

Staying here means you’re as close as possible to everything this area has to offer, even if you aren't a skier. Take a hike to the summit (your muscles will certainly burn afterwards), go tubing, or even snowshoeing - every family member will have a great time! Mt. Crested Butte vacation rentals have the best peak views around, and there are so many choices for hiking trails, mountain biking, and even swimming and rafting nearby.

Mt. Crested Butte may be a small ski town, but it has everything you need to enjoy your vacation, with a few wonderful restaurants, bars, spas, and some truly amazing ski-in/ski-out vacation rentals!

The town of Mt. Crested Butte proper is tucked directly at the base of the ski resort, so you can't get any closer to the lifts. Three miles south is the similarly named but separate (and larger) historic town of Crested Butte. This larger town center offers many more boutiques, dining options, and happy hours, along with its own selection of fantastic Crested Butte vacation rentals that put you a bit closer to the vibrant heart of town.

Luckily, in Colorado, many of the incredible vistas and ski areas are within a few hours of each other. The surrounding Gunnison Valley is stunning, with many different mountains for your climbing craving, including the Gunnison National Forest, beautiful Black Canyon, and Hartman Rocks Recreation Area nearby.

The bigger ski resorts such as Vail, Copper Mountain, and Keystone, plus the diverse and urban city of Denver, are all within a four to five-hour drive. Take a night or two away from your base in Mt. Crested Butte to explore everything Colorado has to offer!

Our ever-growing selection of Mt. Crested Butte vacation rentals truly have it all for anyone in your crew. Whether you're more interested in the outrageously beautiful nature nearby or the smaller, more intimate mountain towns with friendly natives and eclectic shopping, Mt. Crested Butte is the perfect place to get to know Colorado!
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Minturn/
Choosing a Minturn vacation rental means choosing charm and history without compromising on convenience. As the oldest town in Vail Valley, Minturn offers a lovely, slower-paced alternative to its glamorous neighbors like Beaver Creek or Vail, but is still quite close to world-class ski resorts and year-round outdoor adventure. Minturn's charms include antique stores, galleries, and great local restaurants. After a day of skiing, stop for margaritas at the Minturn Saloon or stop by the Sticky Fingers cafe on the way to the mountain for a latte and a cinnamon roll. The winter months find skiers and snowboarders enjoying the historic charm just ten minutes from Vail proper, and the summer finds visitors flocking to the weekly Minturn Farmer's Market or to the Eagle River for kayaking and fishing. This old Western town has historic heft and a laid-back appeal you may not find in all parts of the Vail Valley, along with all the amenities and convenience of a resort town. When you're looking for an unconventional spot to book a Vail Valley vacation home, consider the charms of our Minturn rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Pagosa-Springs/
Experience the glorious Western slope of Colorado when you stay in rustic Pagosa Springs. Tucked into the upper basin of the San Juan Mountains along the Colorado Sunbelt, Pagosa Springs is "simplicity on a grand scale" - this is a resort town in disguise. Our Pagosa Springs vacation rentals will lead you to a land hardly touched: Pagosa Springs is surrounded by over 3 million acres of national forest, wilderness preserve, and native tribes' lands, leaving the surrounding landscape greatly undisturbed. The luxury of this Western Slope destination is in more than just the fabulous, man-made accommodations: it's in the natural beauty that thrives right outside every threshold.

The geothermal hot springs is what draws so many visitors to this little town. The world's deepest geothermal hot spring, or "Mother Spring" resides here, offering its warm, mineral-laced waters to the bodies of weary travelers. The Southern Utes used the phrase "Pagosah", or "healing waters" (hence the town's name), and these springs have long been reputed to have therapeutic benefits. If you're looking for a place to seriously unwind, then a Pagosa Springs vacation rental is the best choice for you. Pagosa offers three soaking locations of various sizes - from a single large pool, to 23 smaller pools of varying temperature. All three hot springs offer full-service spas - treat yourself to some serious pampering!

Take advantage of all the wild space around you to do some major exploration. Like most Colorado towns, this is a place bustling with activity and made with the outdoorsy in mind. Pagosa Springs is a great place to try something new and different: try whitewater rafting in the San Juan River in May and June, and tubing/floating in July and August. Always had an interest in rock climbing, or paddle boarding? Ever taken a hot air balloon ride, or seen the Continental Divide? Pagosa is the place to try! Classic summer activities like hiking, ATV and Jeep tours, and mountain biking are a must. Interested in learning about the wildlife? Stop by the Rocky Mountain Wildlife Park, a facility dedicated to the education and rehabilitation of Colorado wildlife. If wintertime is more your speed, Wolf Creek Ski Resort is just 30 minutes up the road for alpine and cross country skiing. And who would say no to a guided dog-sled tour?

Downtown Pagosa Springs is a hub of activity due to the proximity of the soaking pools, and there are plenty of art galleries, shops, and dining options to keep every guest entertained. Shop at the Lantern Dancer or Home Again, and visit Shy Rabbit Contemporary Arts for art collections and professional workshops. Want to head outside of Pagosa Springs? Try visiting Durango and Silverton for mining and railroad history, or Mesa Verde National Park for archaeological sites. And when it's time to eat, you'll have a myriad of choices from Riff Raff Brewing Company to Side Street Sushi. Our Pagosa Springs vacation rentals will take you away from the ordinary to the extraordinary and beyond - your wild haven and rejuvenating retreat awaits.

Fishing is popular in both Snowmass Creek and the Roaring Fork River, where anglers can enjoy a variety of fish all year round. The Roaring Fork is a popular place to launch small water crafts like kayaks and rafts, and raft trips from Aspen to Glenwood Springs are a must.

Hikers and bikers will find several trailheads in Old Snowmass, including the Rio Grande Bike Trail that goes through Aspen and all the way to Glenwood Springs. If you take the trail west towards Basalt, you'll find a Whole Foods market and the Frying Pan River for more fishing and wading.

While there are very few services provided in Old Snowmass itself, most of our Snowmass vacation rentals provide WiFi and cable as well as full-service kitchens to prepare meals at home. If you feel like dining out, Aspen and Snowmass Village offer a variety of foods to suit every taste.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Rico/
Visitors looking to for a laid-back alternative to the glitz and glam of many resort towns will enjoy a Colorado vacation rental in secluded, peaceful Rico. Nestled among the high mountains in the San Juan National Forest, Rico offers a small-town hideaway that's hard to beat.

With a vibrant mining and railroad history, this "Lady of Tranquility" is a town steeped in mountain history. And when you wake up in the morning and look out your window at the impressive peaks and shimmering forests, you'll feel as though you are caught up in a dream.

Located about 28 miles from Telluride, and about 55 miles from Mancos, this scenic small town is truly hidden away from the noise of its larger counterparts.

Active folks will thrive in Rico's rich natural environment. Surrounded by forests and peaks, clear streams and steep cliffs, the outdoor enthusiast will have a hard time sitting still. The Lizard Head Wilderness is an astounding stretch of terrain perfect for hikers and mountain bikers - an excursion in the fall means coming face to face with some truly gorgeous colors.

Road bikers will love the challenge of biking Lizard Head Pass, a 28 mile paved road between Rico and Telluride, while hunters and fisherman will find Rico's nearby forests and streams teaming with game (proper licensing and fees apply).

Backcountry adrenaline seekers won't be able to resist tracks of deep powder in the winter time. And if backcountry isn't your scene, Nordic skiing and snowshoeing trails are endless. Alpine skiers will enjoy nearby access to the Telluride Ski Resort for varied terrain and an excellent customer-oriented experience.

Thoughtful introverts will particularly love our Rico vacation rentals for the town's single main street and handful of historical buildings. Visit the Rico Historical Museum, or wander through the nearby forests and see what you can find - a handful of old mining structures still stand, perfect for photo opportunities.

Nature lovers will enjoy the abundant wildlife. This is a great place to bird watch, with around 300 species of birds living in the San Juan forest region, from meadow larks and bluebirds to bald and golden eagles. Watch the mountainsides for bighorn sheep, and keep your eyes peeled for pika and marmots on your hikes.

When you stay in a Rico vacation rental, you're saying yes to a mountain experience that will truly refresh your senses and open your eyes to the natural beauty of Colorado.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Snowmass-Village/
The allure of the Rocky Mountains is fully expressed in the charming nature of our Snowmass Village vacation rentals in beautiful Colorado. Surrounded by peaks and valleys, this ski resort village is a self-contained, family-friendly resort that offers a little something for each member of your varied group. From intense glade skiing and park riding to hot air balloons and photography, our Snowmass Village condos and getaways are the launch pad for adventure.

Located nine miles from downtown Aspen, and operated under Aspen/Snowmass Resort, the Snowmass ski resort boasts over 3,300 acres of varied terrain. Expert and local skiers/riders flock to Snowmass for its intense rides in the Burnt Mountain Glades and The Cirque, and park enthusiasts love the runs in the Snowmass Park and Superpipe. First and foremost, however, is this mountain's accessibility to all levels. In addition to the exceptional ski/ride school and friendly service, there are nine on-mountain restaurants to unbuckle and regroup while enjoying remarkable views. Sign your children up for ski lessons and child care services at the Treehouse Kids Adventure Center, while you ski and ride at your own pace (with breaks for adult beverages), or take an adult lesson!

Try out Nordic skiing, or visit the Ice Age Discovery Center to learn about the recent archaeological discovery at Ziegler Reservoir.

This Colorado town winds down in the summertime, transitioning from a high-intensity ski resort to a peaceful, local haven. When you stay in a Snowmass Village condo with Vacasa, you'll have access to all the fun. Late spring through the fall mean warm days spent outside: biking Snowmass - one of the summer highlights for locals and visitors alike - hiking the alpine meadows, or strolling through Snowmass Village and downtown Aspen. Take an early morning hot air balloon ride and watch the sun kiss the tops of the Rockies, or plan a trail ride with a local stable. The Snowmass Recreation Center offers year-round athletic classes, a pool, and a rock climbing gym - or try your hand at outdoor climbing! Parents looking for an opportunity to take a couple's hike/bike ride will love the kids' day camps offered for a range of age groups.

There's always something to do in Snowmass Village - there are free concerts every Thursday night in the summer, bonfires and s'mores during Valhalla Nights, and the Jazz Aspen Labor Day Festival. While Aspen is close at hand for more activities, Snowmass is its own entity, boasting a grocery store, and even a bowling alley!

Though known for its outdoor, adventurous lifestyle, this luxurious Colorado town isn't just about skiing/riding, the biking, the hiking, or even of the surroundings. It's the feeling of connection - to the mountains, to the people, to the land - that makes a stay in a Snowmass Village vacation rental a truly special one.

#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/Vail/

Bavarian-style villages and pedestrian streets exude an Old World charm and host diverse boutiques and dining, from sandwich shops to five-star cuisine heralded in national magazines. Sunny pub decks invite you to share a mid-day beer, while dance clubs, live music, and piano and karaoke bars bring the village to life once the sun sets. And, of course, the carefully manicured slopes of Vail Mountain are just steps away.
#Pathname:/usa/Colorado/West-Vail/
Nothing grows like a good idea, and West Vail is proof. In 1962, after WWII ski trooper Peter Seibert decided to build a replica of the ski resort he saw in Zermatt, Switzerland. The product of his efforts - Vail Resort - became so successful, it had to expand in both directions to accommodate the flood of winter sports enthusiasts. West Vail became the western edge of that expansion.

Though it's mostly residential, West Vail is actually larger than Vail Village and still just a short drive or free shuttle ride away from the world famous resort. It's a great place to stay, not only because it's a little less hectic than Vail Village, it's ideally situated to exploit both the sunshine from the north, and the alpine vistas from the south.

From the beginning, Vail has been, of course, mostly about the snow. Surrounded by White River National Forest, Vail Resort is actually leased from the U.S. Forest Service. From a base elevation of 8,120 feet, Vail Mountain soars to a height of 11, 570 feet. The mountain's 5,289 ski-able acres of diverse difficulty are accessed by three base areas: Lionshead, Vail Village, and Golden Peak, each of which has its own distinctive, state of the art gondola or chairlift system to whisk skiers and snowboarders quickly to their chosen destination. And there are plenty of other winter activities in and around West Vail like snowshoeing, ice climbing, snowmobiling, dog sledding, or just a nice, tranquil sleigh ride. Or, try the slopes at one of the neighboring resorts, like Beaver Creek, or Ski Cooper. Aspen, Winter Park, and Breckenridge are other venues accessible by car. And that's just winter.

In summer, the area around West Vail and Vail is a magnet for hikers (a popular hike is one around Booth Falls) and backpackers, anglers, cyclists, horseback riders, climbers, kayakers, and canoe-ers. How about a hot air balloon ride or just a leisurely ride on a gondola with breathtaking views of the Rockies all about you! Though West Vail does have a few eateries where you can grab everything from a sandwich to sushi, the gold standard for dining is just a few minutes to the east in Vail Resort where you'll have your choice of 23 restaurants catering to diverse tastes from haute cuisine to a quick snack. After you've eaten, check out the great shops between Lionshead and Vail Village where you'll find everything from outdoor gear to artworks. Find the perfect cowboy boots or ski boots, jewelry and cocktail dresses, and apparel.

Whatever your idea of a perfect vacation, a stay in West Vail could very well be your ticket to a good time and great memories of beautiful, abundant, and exciting Vail Valley.

#Pathname:/usa/Florida/Fort-Lauderdale/
Beautiful beaches, year-round warm weather, and landmarks that will appeal to history buffs everywhere are just a few of the reasons why visitors flock to Fort Lauderdale - and you’ll have front-door access to all of them when you stay in one of our Fort Lauderdale vacation rentals!

Nestled between the bright lights and big city of Miami and the quaint coastal town of Pompano Beach, Fort Lauderdale is equal parts laid-back beach haven and lively arts and entertainment mecca. It’s also one of the most popular destinations for Florida vacation rentals, thanks to its access to both small town living and big city amenities.

Fort Lauderdale is a popular location for vacationers of all different ages because it has something for everyone. Catch some rays on any of Fort Lauderdale’s 23 miles of sun-kissed beaches - including Dania Beach, Deerfield Beach, Hillsboro Beach, Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, and Hollywood Beach - all within a short walk from restaurants, shopping, and even your front door!

Kids will love building sandcastles on the white sand beach and swimming in the aquamarine Atlantic waters while you relax and read a great novel with a South Florida-inspired plot by author Carl Hiaasen, one of Fort Lauderdale’s native sons. Afterwards, head over to any of the area’s low-key beach bar and grill restaurants, like Coconuts, for noshing on some conch fritters and catch-of-the-day seafood as you watch yachts sail by on the New River Sound.

When the sun goes down the nightlife comes alive, so put on your dancing shoes and head to the city’s Riverwalk Arts & Entertainment District in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Here you’ll find art galleries, world-class concerts at the Broward Center for Performing Arts, and tours with the Fort Lauderdale Historical Society of the area’s stately historic homes, like the Stranahan House. On these guided walks you’ll also learn about the city’s founding families and their lasting legacies. Though kids are welcome on these tours and in the Riverwalk area, the events in this district undoubtedly will appeal more to grown up tastes.

While Fort Lauderdale offers plenty to see on land, the city’s coastal location boasts plenty of underwater activities too! So naturalists and those seeking outdoor adventure take note: snorkeling and scuba diving off Lauderdale-By-The-Sea Beach has a three-tiered reef system that divers can enjoy exploring year-round. Divers can snorkel right off the beach and discover the unique Biorock Project, an artificial reef structure deployed in 2011 and now home to sea turtles, tropical fish, and many more sea creatures. It also provides the backdrop to BugFest-by-the-Sea, a week-long series of fun events, seminars, and contests for scuba divers centered around Florida’s two day lobster mini-season at the end of July!

Fort Lauderdale offers immediate access to the blue waters and great surf of Florida’s Atlantic coast. Many of Florida’s famed Atlantic beaches north and south of Fort Lauderdale, including Palm Beach, South Beach, and Vero Beach, are easily reached via Interstate 95.

Giant alligators, snakes, and other assorted swamp critters can be seen in preserved native habitat 73 miles away in the Everglades National Park. In the cooler (but still warm!) winter months, kids will love a visit to this national park, where daily tours on airboats give up close views of all the swamp species. For a more urban experience, Miami's world-famous food, shopping, and nightlife scenes are just  29 miles down the road.

For a fantastic home base in the entertainment and relaxation hub of southeast Florida, you can’t go wrong with a stay in any of our Fort Lauderdale vacation rentals!

#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/Atlanta/
Sweet Georgia peaches, lazy days at Turner Field, the Coca-Cola factory, and Civil War battlegrounds - these are just four things that come to mind when one thinks of Atlanta, and the many attractions that abound when you plan a stay in one of our Atlanta vacation rentals!

The capital city of Georgia sits in the north of the state, flanked by the Appalachian Mountains and the Chatahootchee River. With nearly half a million residents, the city has a diverse and unique populace that embodies Southern hospitality at its finest. The Creek and Cherokee tribes were the first settlers; Europeans arrived in the early 1800s. Reconstruction brought unprecedented growth and prosperity, making the city a national transportation and education hub. Today, Atlanta enjoys a reputation for good food, good drink, great art, and culture, and our Atlanta vacation rentals provide the perfect base from which to tour and admire this bustling metropolis.

As the largest urban center in the state, Atlanta boasts myriad attractions from the high-brow to the recreational. As the international headquarters of Coca-Cola, visitors can expect an effervescent experience at The World of Coke. Tour the two-level museum and admire Coke memorabilia from yesteryear, as well as interactive exhibits in the 4-D theater. The highlight of any visit is the Taste It! room, which features more than 100 different Coke varieties from around the world (there's even one that tastes like vodka)!

Just down the street lies the Georgia Aquarium, one of the largest and best in the country, boasting six permanent exhibits about various sea mammals, from the Cold Water Quest (Beluga whales) to Ocean Explorer (whale sharks) to Dolphin Quest (dolphins, naturally!). Designed by Richard Meier and Renzo Piano, the High Museum of Art is the top museum in town, thanks to its enviable collection of contemporary and folk art and photography. Admire Target by Elizabeth Catlett or Queen's Mesh by Alan Saret.

Civil rights aficionados flock to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. Tour the late leader's birthplace as well as The Peace Plaza. You'll be captivated by the "I Have a Dream" World Peace Rose Garden, and messages of peace from local schoolchildren.

As the site of many important battles during the Civil War, Atlanta is a history buff's wonderland. Head to the Peachtree Creek Battlefield, currently occupied by Tanyard Creek Park and Oakland Cemetery or the Battles of Ezra Church, Brown's Mill, and Utoy Creek. You'll find historical markers, statues, and tombstones commemorating the dead.

For a less somber excursion, spend the day watching baseball at Turner Field. The ballpark, built in 1997 and named for native son and media mogul Ted Turner, is the home of the Atlanta Braves and is known for its old-school feel and modern amenities. It's considered one of the best parks for innovative dining.

Atlanta is world-renowned for its numerous parks and outdoor spaces. At nearly 200 acres, Piedmont Park is the city's version of Central Park, with a greenmarket, pool, dog park, and fishing site. Stone Mountain is a hotspot for hiking as well as kid-friendly activities such as gondola rides, treetop treks, and rope bridge tours. As the second largest natural rock formation after Uluru (aka Australia's Ayers Rock) it's also considered the "Mt. Rushmore of the Confederacy," due to its Confederate memorial carving.

The Atlanta Botanical Garden is a paradise for flora, from orchids to roses and everything in between, across 30 acres. One of the gardens' highlights is the Kendeda Canopy Walk, a 600-foot-long walkway above one of the last remaining urban forests in the city.

An urban oasis with a wealth of outdoor and indoor attractions, Atlanta is a world-class destination. Stay at one of our Atlanta vacation rentals and you'll see why!
#Pathname:/usa/Florida/Sugarloaf-Key/
Let the tropical island trio of warm breezes, white sand beaches, and fun in the sun guide you to deep relaxation in one of our Sugarloaf Key vacation rentals.

Deriving its name from a type of pineapple once grown in the area, Sugarloaf Key is comprised of an upper and lower island and belongs to Florida’s lower keys. The area’s abundant wildlife and great fishing make it a sportsman’s paradise, while the white sand beaches and laid-back island atmosphere appeals to casual vacationers including families, couples, and retirees.

Located between Saddlebunch Keys to the west and Cudjoe Key to the east, both upper and lower islands of Sugarloaf Key sit on open, shallow waters that play host to world-class sport-fishing. Home to tarpon, bonefish, grouper and many more large fish species, this area is particularly well-suited for those looking to land a trophy fish. Hire a guide for the day at any of the island’s fishing charters, and head out by boat to the area's prime fishing grounds, known as flats, where you’ll hook a 150-pound tarpon and have the fight of a lifetime trying to reel it in.

Non-fisherfolk will also find plenty to do! Rent kayaks and paddle into the Upper Sugarloaf Sound, where you can the explore mangrove swamp coastline alongside dolphins playing in the surf. If you prefer to have your adventures on land, grab your family and head down to see the Sugarloaf Key Bat Tower a tower built in 1929 to entice bats and provide a solution to the area’s mosquito problem. Kids will love watching the bats fly frenetically around the structure, catching insects in mid-flight.

Our Florida Keys vacation rentals in Sugarloaf Key are only 15 miles from the region's biggest draw: Key West. Head into the larger city for an afternoon touring the Hemingway Home & Museum, then take in the sunset and spectacle at Mallory Square Dock. Grab a margarita and some fresh fish tacos at one of the local restaurants...unless your fridge back in Sugarloaf Key is full of your own daily catch!

Want to avoid the Key West crowds? Head 15 miles back toward the mainland to the kayaking, scuba, and snorkeling paradise surrounding Big Pine. Divers can explore the undersea wreckage of the Adolphus Bush, and snorkelers will be well-rewarded with a trip out to the coral reefs at Looe Key.

For a fantastic home base with direct access to the best of Florida’s world-class fishing and island adventure, a stay in one of our Sugarloaf Key vacation rentals can’t be beat!
#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/St-Simons-Island/
With a fantastic year-round climate and the famous Marshes of Glynn, St. Simons Island vacation rentals have long been a destination for discerning Southerners looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city. Beautiful beaches, multiple golf courses, places to fish and canoe, and great restaurants and spas make this Georgia island a popular vacation spot each yet.

Like its fellow tranquil Golden Isles - Sea Island, Jekyll Island, and Little St. Simons Island - St. Simons is camera-ready, with streets full off moss-laden oaks and sailboats drifting through the harbor. First settled by Native Americans and then Spanish colonists, St. Simons has managed to retain a rich cultural heritage. Summer barbecues are the norm, as are lazy days spent swimming and kayaking on the water.

St. Simons packs a lot in 18 square miles. The beaches are the most popular attraction, and East Beach is the best of the bunch. It offers a wide stretch of sand, concessions, and a Coast Guard Station. Neptune Park is especially popular with kids. Relax at one of the picnic tables, take a dip in the public pool, or try your hand at miniature golf. Visitors can also fish on the pier or enjoy events during the summer at the bandstand.

The St. Simons Lighthouse Museum was constructed in 1807 and features a restored lighthouse and keeper's home, both built in 1872 after the originals were destroyed in the Civil War. Climb to the top and admire an Instagram-worthy view of the Golden Isles.

Colonial and Civil War buffs will enjoy the trolley tour through the island's historic sites. Fort Frederica National Monument is the site of a bloody but deciding battle between colonists and the Spanish in the 1600s. Admire the Spanish moss and pecan trees as you meander through the prison barracks and other remnants of the fort. Don't forget to pay your respects at the Bloody Marsh Battle site.

The two-story First African Baptist Church was built in 1869 by former slaves, and still serves as the spiritual center for the island's African American community. The lovely and amazing Avenue of the Oaks ?beckons visitors to the grounds of the Sea Island resort and its world-class golf.

The picture-perfect Marshes of the Glynn are first visible as you cross the F. J. Torras Causeway from the mainland. Made famous by poet Sidney Lanier, you'll spy salt marshes as well as fishermen harvesting shrimp, blue crab, and oysters.

Day trips from St. Simons Island are easy, and well worth a detour. The historic squares and excellent restaurants of Savannah is just an hour and a half away, offering a rich heritage and world-famous architecture. If you can't get enough of the coast, Tybee Island is also interesting, boasting a marine science center, a national monument, and two lighthouses.

With lovely beaches, quaint shops and well-preserved historic sites, St. Simons beguiles and beckons...and our St. Simons Island vacation rentals will help you enjoy all it has to offer.

Tiny Cockspur Lighthouse was built in 1855 and features a 46-foot-tower that once saw 30 hours of battle during the Civil War. Grab a picnic and head to Fort Pulaski National Monument.

#Pathname:/usa/Georgia/Woodbine/
Woodbine is a quaint Georgia hamlet that has long held onto its small-town roots. This charming town sits on the state's southern coast and offers mom-and-pop shops aplenty, as well as Gothic revival buildings and weekly Woodbine Opry performances.

Founded in 1893, the town is known statewide for its annual crawfish festival as well as its namesake honeysuckle plants and secluded fishing sites.

Waterfront Park abuts the Satilla River and offers places to kayak and canoe on one of the state's premier river trails. The Woodbine Riverwalk is a nice three-mile sojourn, starting off at the waterfront boardwalk and winding its way under a bridge and tree-lined residential areas boasting historic homes. Make sure to take your bike with you and whip through the mountain bike trail at the end of the walk.

Woodbine is on the tail end of the Coastal Georgia Greenway, which weaves through six counties and 450 miles of trails, starting in lovely Savannah and ending up in St. Mary's parish. The Georgia Coast Rail-Trail is part of the national Rails to Trails Conversancy, and the Woodbine portion boasts three miles along the Satilla River with views of cedar, pine, and other indigenous trees.

Locals head to the Woodbine Opry to take in performances by local and national country, gospel, and bluegrass music acts every Friday and Saturday night. The annual Woodbine Crawfish Festival lures in seafood lovers from around the state for the delicious crawfish and authentic étouffée every April. The area is home to many farms boasting fresh blueberries, strawberries, and other produce. Harrietts Bluff Farm is one of the most popular, and opens at the end of April every year.

Woodbine is charming but small, and though secluded, still offers some pleasant day trips to explore the rest of the region. Historic Savannah and the beaches of Tybee Island are only two hours up the coast, offering historic antebellum homes and beautiful scenery. St. Simons Island is just a 40-minute drive away, and boasts natural wonders and historic forts.

Offering pretty tree-lined streets and a slower pace, Woodbine, Georgia is the perfect retreat for anyone looking to get off the grid. Our Woodbine vacation rentals let you really get away from it all.

#Pathname:/usa/Idaho/Donnelly/
Travelers who love outdoor adventure without the resort-town bustle will treasure their time at a McCall / Valley County vacation rental in Donnelly! This charming Idaho town sits on the northern end of Lake Cascade, just half an hour from the town of McCall.

And whether you seek a secluded mountain cabin or a golfside condo, Vacasa has the perfect Donnelly vacation rental waiting for you.

Lake Cascade may be Donnelly's most famous body of water, but not its only one: the nearby Payette River offers even more fishing, kayaking and canoeing. Warmer months also bring golfers to the Donnelly area, with eight courses within fourteen miles of town (the closest being Osprey Meadows at Tamarack).

Beyond outdoor adventure, Donnelly is well-known for its lively festival scene. Each August brings the much-anticipated huckleberry festival, and the nearby historic settlement of Roseberry hosts music nights, arts & crafts fairs, and ice cream socials throughout the summer. For travelers who love golf, skiing, fishing, snowshoeing, or simply curling up by a cozy fireplace with a good book and a gorgeous view, a Donnelly cabin rental may be just the ticket for your next Idaho getaway!

#Pathname:/usa/Idaho/Hayden-Lake/
Idaho is loaded with lakes. There's Coeur d'Alene, and Pend Oreielle, to name two. They're both pretty big: Coeur d'Alene is 49.8 sq. miles, and Pend Oreielle, a whopping 148. Squeezed between them, at a humble 24.75 sq. miles, is Hayden Lake -- an ideal spot for a Coeur d'Alene region vacation rental. Considering its comparatively miniscule size, one would think Little Hayden Lake would be shunned and neglected in favor of the watery behemoths sitting astride it; and one would be wrong. What Hayden Lake lacks in size is made up for in reputation.

Its shoreline has more exclusive homes per square inch than many other places in the country. Despite a population of a little over 500 souls, Hayden Lake has its own country club. Bing Crosby, we're told, liked it here, and if you're into golf, there are no less than 13 golf courses in and around Hayden Lake and nearby Coeur d'Alene . But if you think Hayden Lake is snooty, you'd be wrong about that too! From your Hayden Lake vacation rental you can enjoy the water and all the fun stuff to do nearby. Bring your boat and launch it at one of the three boat ramps located at Honeysuckle Beach, Sportsman's Park, and Tobler's Marina. Take the family over to Triple Play Fun Park where you can do everything from bumper cars, to laser tag, bowling, and rock climbing. Ride the roller coaster at Silverwood Amusement Park, test your skateboarding mettle at "sk8ts" skatepark, or slip and slide your way around the Raptor Reef Water Park.

A Hayden Lake vacation rental offers a bit of everything - the lake, golf, amusement park fun, and seemingly endless afternoons of just relaxing at your charming Hayden Lake cabin.
#Pathname:/usa/Idaho/Hayden/
Only six miles north of bustling Coeur d'Alene lies adventure-filled Hayden, a great choice for a Coeur d'Alene region vacation rental in postcard-perfect northern Idaho.

Whether it's biking, fishing, golfing or sailing, there's a lot to do in this small, active community near the crystal clean waters of Hayden Lake. Just like Harrison to the south, biking is a big part of Hayden culture as the city constructs more and more interlocking bike trails and bike lanes throughout the town. The paved, scenic Centennial Trail runs all the way from the Washington border to the east side of Lake Coeur d'Alene. If you're a cyclist, you'll definitely want to bring your bike to your Hayden getaway, or just rent wheels at a nearby shop like Terra Sports. And in summer, many of the area's ski resorts have rugged trails just for mountain biking!

Of course, your favorite activity may just be relaxing on the porch of your lakefront Hayden cabin, watching the sunset and having a glass of wine. Being right near Hayden Lake and its over 40 miles of shoreline, also means water sports are huge here - white water rafting, jet skiing, sailing, parasailing - the choices are endless in this part of the northern Idaho panhandle.

Hayden area ski resorts usually enjoy up to 400 inches of snow annually. And with four ski resorts within an hour's drive of your Hayden getaway, you'll have your pick of downhill adventures. Spend time on the seemingly endless acres of the Schweitzer Mountain Resort or shred the powder at Silver Mountain on the northern face of the glorious Bitterroot Mountain range. Nordic skiers will also be able to enjoy miles of trails running through national forest lands and state parks.

If you don't feel like preparing a meal in your vacation home's kitchen, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the number of dining choices right in Hayden! The Blue Plate Cafe is the place to go for filling, hearty breakfasts like biscuits and gravy and the Porch Public House pairs creative plates of food with area microbrews.

For a trip full of discovery, adventure, delicious meals, and relaxation year-round, look no further than a charming Hayden vacation rental.

Any time of year, if you don't want to prepare a home-cooked meal in your Ketchum vacation home, you can head out to one of over 60 area restaurants. Quickly becoming a foodie destination, eclectic Ketchum will definitely not disappoint your palate. Local favorite The Kneadery is a must-stop for a pre-ski breakfast or post-hike lunch, with locally baked organic bread, hearty egg dishes, burgers, and salads.

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Bar-Harbor/
From its majestic granite cliffs to its rocky windswept shore, Bar Harbor has been a playground for Northeasterners for more than a century. Thanks to a well-preserved downtown, scenic lighthouses, and access to the nearby 47,000-acre Acadia National Park, any of our Bar Harbor vacation rentals make the perfect home base from which to explore this lovely island town and its environs.

Bar Harbor is a outdoor-lover's dream destination. Much of that is due to its location on its own island off the mainland. Most visitors head first to nearby Acadia National Park. Avid hikers have been heading here since 1919, thanks to groups such as The Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal organization, that constructed many of the trails - 120 miles in all - and campgrounds used today. Visitors can camp at four sites, some year round, and even enjoy food at the Jordan Pond House, the only restaurant on park land. Acadia boasts the tallest mountain on the U.S. Atlantic coast and the Bass Harbor Headlight, as well as lakes, streams and a museum.

Staying right in town in one of our Bar Harbor cottage rentals? The town itself offers many recreational activities. Guests love to bike the 45 miles of carriage road around town. Coastal fishing, canoeing, snowmobiling, and whale watching are all popular activities. Stand-up paddle boarding has become all the rage in recent seasons, and sea kayaking remains popular with active visitors. Agamont Park on the waterfront is a nice place for a summer picnic or to watch the sunset.

If the great outdoors are not your cup of tea, Bar Harbor boasts many indoor opportunities around town sure to lure you from our cozy Bar Harbor cabins! The Abbe Museum focuses on Maine's indigenous population and the Bar Harbor Historical Society boasts many historical manuscripts and exhibits. Bar Harbor hosts an annual fine arts and music festival, and the College of the Atlantic presents Family Nature Camps throughout the summer. You can tour the local winery and brewery, and even take carriage-driving lessons at Wild Iris Farms.

Lighthouses are a New England fixture, and Bar Harbor boasts six well-maintained structures. Head to Blue Hill Bay or Frenchman Bay to watch the flashing lights and fog blasts. Students can study marine biology at the Great Duck Island Light, and guests can have dinner at the Isle au Haut Light.

The town is a great base from which to embark on day trips. The Schoodic Point section of Acadia National Park is less busy and more tranquil than the Mt. Desert portion. You can swim or play on the nearby rocks.

Bar Harbor has many ferries heading up as far as New Brunswick, Canada, and down to nearby islands. Little Cranberry Island, a local favorite, can be reached by mailboat and boasts a museum as well as restaurants to enjoy the lobster. Swan's Island features a summer folk music festival and a recently built general store. Isle de Haut is accessible by mailboat via Stonington, and features a lighthouse as well as many spots to picnic and enjoy the summer weather.

Quaint Camden is just two hours south of Bar Harbor, and you'll spy many even sleepier coastal towns along the way. Take a jaunt to the observation deck of the Peobscot Narrows Bridge or enjoy the view of Camden Harbor and part of Penobscot Bay from the top of Mt. Battle in Camden Hills State Park.

From touring lighthouses to taking a lobster ferry to hiking Acadia National Park to enjoying a meal in town, our Bar Harbor vacation rentals are a great base from which to enjoy it all!

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/East-Boothbay/
With a lovely shoreline and history as a boat-building mecca, East Boothbay has been beguiling tourists and locals since the mid-1800s. With all the comforts of home and a wonderful location to explore the surrounding region, our Maine vacation rentals in East Boothbay make a fantastic home base for your next getaway.

One of five villages in the Boothbay Harbor region, East Boothbay impresses due to its small-town feel and friendly populace. The village's rich maritime history is one of the many reasons visitors head here annually. Local boat captains allow guests to accompany them on lobster-hauling expeditions and families are welcome to take a trip on a windjammer around the harbor. You can even rent a boat to explore the numerous coves and area lighthouses on your own, or take your turn trolling for tuna and striper on a sport fisherman.

Not everything in East Boothbay is about the sea - there's plenty to do on land as well. The

Linekin Preserve & Burley Loop offers nearly 150 acres of woodland and approximately three miles of varied terrain near the Damariscotta River.

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Edgecomb/
Named for an English lord who sided with American colonists, the town of Edgecomb, Maine, is a tiny hamlet in Lincoln County. Although dwarfed by bigger towns nearby, Edgecomb has its own unique appeal, thanks to small-town hospitality and a historic fort that attracts numerous history buffs every summer. Founded in 1774 but settled three decades earlier, this charming spot is home to mom-and-pop shops, tree-lined streets, and well-maintained historic buildings. Our Edgecomb vacation rentals offer a beautiful and tranquil place to holiday in the gorgeous, verdant state of Maine.

Edgecomb is located in the heart of Lincoln County and is less than three hours from Boston, in the rugged and beautiful Boothbay region. The town has less than 1500 inhabitants and retains much of its old-school feel as a result. You're not far from the Atlantic Coast and myriad fishing spots.

Fort Edgecomb State Historic Site is the premier tourist spot in town. Built in 1808, the fort was a stronghold for the port of Wiscasset and saw a lot of action during the bloody War of 1812. Tour the interior and admire the stonework. High Head Point is a favorite spot nearby for picnickers in the summer and leaf peepers in the fall. The John Moore House is listed on the National Register of Historic places. The white clapboard home on Crosspoint Road is a private residence, but can be admired from the street.

Although it's tiny, Edgecomb boasts a surprising number of quaint businesses. Savor a relaxing massage at Island Spa, one of the top spots in town for locals and anyone traveling through. Learn how to shuck oysters and take some home with you at the eco-friendly Gidden Point Oyster Sea Farm.

Edgecomb lies in the heart of the Boothbay region, which offers plenty of recreation sites as well as historic structures. The neighboring towns of East Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, and Boothbay  are all within close proximity, offering plenty of coastal splendor, hiking trails, botanical gardens, and sea adventures. Nobleboro is also nearby, boasting several great fishing sites, as is Bar Harbor, with its granite cliffs and the Abbe Museum. For a more urban environment, Boston and its plethora of cultural and historical sites, not to mention sport venues, is less than three hours away by car.

Coastal splendor amid a truly small-town feel is what you get when you stay at one of our Edgecomb vacation rentals in Maine!
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Kennebunkport/
Kennebunkport, Maine, though scintillating in the summer months, evokes the quintessential quaintness of coastal New England all year round. Known most famously for hosting George H. W. Bush's summer home, Kennebunkport attracts tourists and visitors who venture to the town for a peek at the Bush compound but stay and return annually. Regulars spend lazy afternoons on the beach or mornings perusing the downtown's eateries, boutiques, and art galleries. Once you stay in one of our Kennebunkport vacation rentals, you'll become a regular, too.

The allure of the mighty Atlantic along the bluffs of Ocean Avenue inspires nostalgia for vanished days of yore when mighty ships cruised the sea. In Kennebunkport, you can channel your adventurous spirit on a boat tour or fishing charter, shop for nautical treasures downtown, stroll through history in local museums, or simply marvel at the majesty of the sea from your beach chair, all with the satisfaction of knowing you'll be returning to one of our comfortable Maine vacation rentals at the end of your daily excursions.

During the summer months, there is no clearer indication that tranquility is near than the feeling of soft, white sand between your toes. Goose Rocks Beach definitely delivers in this department, making it a perfect place for a romantic evening walk or a quick beach chair cat nap before searching for shells and sea glass on the shoreline (we dare you to say that five times fast). Occupying three miles of coastline, Goose Rocks boasts scenic views and ample space to get your serenity on. Just note that a parking permit, available at the Kennebunkport Police Station, is required for your vehicle.

Visitors of varying political affiliations will find novelty in snapping a quick picture of Instagram-worthy Walker's Point, the aforementioned Bush compound, from a small, easily found pull-off on Ocean Road that peers directly at the promontory on which the former president's stately pad is located. However, you'll still feel like a VIP as a guest in our Kennebunkport vacation rentals!

The Seashore Trolley Museum transports visitors back in time on an electric railway car. It claims the title of largest electric railway museum in the country with about 250 trolleys, acquired from every major US city with a trolley system, on display. The museum regularly hosts public events, from ice cream nights to themed "speakeasy" gatherings for celebration with libations in Prohibition-era trolley cars.

A trek downtown to peruse Kennebunkport's quirky shops for souvenirs and support local small businesses is a must for anyone spending time in this seaside destination. Meander with a mission to Maine-ly Drizzle, a specialty gourmet olive oil and vinegar store, or to Scalawag's Pet Boutique to pick up a new chew toy for Fido. Those looking to commemorate their getaways with a work of Kennebunkport art can purchase pieces by local artists in the W. Robert Paine Gallery and the Mast Gallery, among others.

When the sea beckons, there is only one way to truly feel the motion of the ocean and appreciate its delicious bounty. Rugosa Lobster Tours offer "a hands-on lobsterman experience" as well as a tour of the Kennebunk River. If there is one thing that Kennebunkport locals know, it's that salt water and sea breezes are good for the soul.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that any vacationer staying in a coastal New England town must be in want of lobster (or any other kind of fresh seafood, for that matter). Nunan's Lobster Hut opens up at five every evening and is regularly packed by six, serving up fresh Kennebunkport-born-and-caught lobster to all who come with an appetite only the juicy red shellfish dunked in butter can satisfy.

For upscale dining with stellar views, Kennebunkport's aptly-dubbed restaurant Ocean at the Cape Arundel Inn is just the place to trade sandy beachwear for evening attire and settle in for an intimate dinner for two or food and drinks with good friends.

When it comes to the Kennebunkport art scene, perhaps no craft is as widely appreciated as the métier of exquisite ice cream, a specialty of the dairy virtuosos at Rococo Artisan Ice Cream. Sticky meets sophisticated with flavors like standard Honey Vanilla, specialties Maple Fig Jalapeño and Banana Salted Almond Caramel, and seasonal Spice Pumpkin Pie, among countless other unexpected gourmet concoctions of mouth-watering sweet and savory ingredients.

Though liveliest during the summer, Kennebunkport is picturesque when dressed in the gold and crimson hues of October foliage, enchanting under the twinkle of holiday lights in December, and romantic and cozy beneath a duvet of snow in February. This seaside town can be enjoyed year round, so there is no wrong time to book one of our Kennebunkport vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Newcastle/
Verdant hills, quiet tree-lined streets, and a beautiful riverside location make Newcastle, Maine, the perfect spot for a relaxing getaway...and our Newcastle vacation rentals offer an idyllic base to explore this lovely, small town.

Named for the Duke of Newcastle, an advisor to King George II, the town was first settled by Europeans in the 17th century. Within 50 years, there were more than 100 residents. The town soon became a shipbuilding mecca, with many of the most prominent boats in the first American navy built here. Sawmills and grist mills became the norm but today, the sleepy hamlet enjoys a peaceful reputation as a place to enjoy nature and solitude.

Newcastle lies in the heart of Lincoln County, between the Sheepscot and Damariscotta Rivers in Mid-Coast Maine. It abuts Edgecomb, Nobleboro and Wiscasset, and sits near Great Salt Bay.

This town is all about nature, and you'll revel in the abundant flora and fauna. Visitors flock to Dodge Point Public Reserved Land on the Damariscotta River. This protected green space encompasses 521 acres  and boasts bald eagles, osprey, foxes, and pine forests. Four main trails offer a wealth of scenic vistas for all levels of hikers, and you can also swim or picnic here in the summer - or snowshoe and cross-country ski in the winter.

One of the most celebrated historic homes in all of Maine lies in Newcastle. The Frances Perkins Homestead celebrates the life and accomplishments of Frances Perkins, the first female Secretary of Labor for the United States. Stroll through 57 acres of meadows and woods as you learn about her enduring legacy.

Newcastle is conveniently situated near other Lincoln County towns, making day trips around the region an easy delight. Head to Nobleboro for its amazing fishing sites. Wiscasset is home to the Sortwell Memorial Forest and bucolic Morris Farm, both great spots for a walk or invigorating hike, and Edgecomb boasts historic Fort Edgecomb and scenic places to bike along the river.

Enjoy quiet reflection and room to breathe at one of our beautiful Newcastle vacation rentals.
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Nobleboro/
Sleepy and small, Nobleboro, Maine, sees an influx of visitors during the summer. Still, even with the many New Englanders seeking quiet refuge in July and August, the town never feels overrun or overcrowded. Friendly locals outnumber tourists, and there are plenty of spots to solitarily pause and reflect on life. Traditional clapboard homes sit on tree-lined streets, and the town's slower pace is reflected in the lack of strip malls and chain stores. It's small-town New England at its finest, and our Maine vacation rentals continue that feeling of authenticity.

Founded in 1788, Nobleboro occupies 23 square miles in the heart of Lincoln County, not far from Boothbay Harbor and the rugged Atlantic Coast. Many of the town's homes were built in the late 18th and early 19th century, and a majority of residents are descendants of the original settlers. Like other towns in the region, Nobleboro was once a shipbuilding mecca. Today, it's quiet and quaint, and the perfect spot for a peaceful getaway.

Visitors should first head to the Nobleboro Historical Society, housed in a schoolhouse built in 1818. The museum boasts records of early settlers and their families and happily provides a map to points of interest in town, from the historic homes scattered throughout the area to the once-mighty factories.

Damariscotta Lake, Pemaquid Pond, and Duck Puddle Pond are popular fishing sites, and bird watchers head to the bald eagle habitat on the edge of town or the waterfowl habitat wetlands found around the area. There's plenty of green space through which one can meander, you might not see another person for miles.

Nobleboro is near many popular Maine vacation spots and even some under-the-radar towns. Hip Camden is 25 miles away and boasts a plethora of great restaurants and art galleries. Both Boothbay Harbor and neighboring East Boothbay are a short drive away, offering small-town appeal, great coastal beaches, and hiking trails galore. Beautiful Bar Harbor is worthy of a full day's visit, as it's nearly three hours away, but offers great hiking through Acadia National Park.

Quiet, calm, and with unique charm, Nobleboro delights - and our Nobleboro vacation rentals are sure to please anyone looking for peace and relaxation!
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/South-Portland/
For a relaxing getaway to a lovely waterfront town, look no further than our South Portland vacation rentals. Situated on Portland Harbor with views of Casco Bay, South Portland is home to both the largest full-service marina and the largest shopping mall in the state of Maine. South Portland is also known for its many gorgeous parks and walking trails, making it a green paradise for visitors from all around.

First settled by Europeans in 1630, South Portland once boasted farms as far as the eye can see. During the Second World War it became a shipbuilding mecca, supplying cargo ships for England. While South Portland has never officially been a part of Portland, Maine proper, the larger town's skyline is visible from many vantage points in the area.

The waterfront is the premier spot in town, with picture-perfect views as well as several historic attractions. Head to Fort Preble, a stone and earthwork military fort built in 1808. It saw combat during the Civil War through the two World Wars. Stroll down the pier to the Spring Point Ledge Light. Built in 1897, it's the only caisson-style lighthouse in the United States that is accessible via a walkway. Visit the Portland Harbor Museum next door for its displays of maritime history. The Portland Breakwater Lighthouse, aka Bug Light, built in 1875, features cast iron plates and gorgeous Corinthian columns.

The Maine Military Museum showcases the service of military vets - specifically POWs - via artifacts and exhibits. The Liberty Ship Memorial features the SS Jeremiah O'Brien - one of the liberty ships that defended the United States during the Second World War - and preserves the sacrifices by the men and women who built the ships.

The city affords guests more than 500 acres of parks and green spaces. Part of the 3,000-mile-long East Coast Greenway, the Greenbelt Walkway trail extends nearly six miles from Bug Light Park to the 140-acre Wainwright Athletic Complex. Clark's Pond Trail, a 1.1 mile-long woodland trail, winds its way through historic sections of town. Long Creek Trail boasts the spot at which Native Americans and English settlers established a treaty. Other notable trails include Red Brook Tail, Thomas Knight Park, Hinckley Park Loop, Spring Point Shoreway and West End Trails, all offering scenic walkways and bike paths through lovely woodlands and ponds.

During the summer, locals and visitors alike venture to Willard Beach, a four-acre sand and pebble beach, for fun in the sun.

South Portland is a great base from which to explore all of Maine. Drive 60 miles up the coast and you'll hit the beautiful seaside towns of Lincoln County including Boothbay Harbor, East Boothbay, Wiscasset, and Nobleboro.

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/South-Bristol/
Charming, quaint, and pleasing to the eye are all apt descriptions of South Bristol, Maine. This small town - which also includes the villages of Walpole and Christmas Cove - boasts tree-lined streets and rollings hills, making it the perfect spot for a relaxation vacation. Our South Bristol vacation rentals make that dream a reality!

First spotted by Europeans in the 15th century, the town of South Bristol wasn't permanently settled until the mid-17th century. The Wawenock tribe gave way to English settlers who named the town after its sister city in England. A brick-making, ship-building, and ice-harvesting mecca, South Bristol today maintains a reputation as a bucolic hamlet with a friendly populace. Fishing, lobstering, and tourism are its biggest draws, and a stay at one of our South Bristol vacation rentals will make you see why.

South Bristol lies in Midcoast Maine in Lincoln County. It abuts Edgecomb, Bristol, Boothbay Harbor, and part of the Atlantic Ocean.

South Bristol is a nature lover's dream, offering scenic woodland and coastal bluffs with views of the Atlantic. Witch Island is an 18-acre wildlife sanctuary off the east coast of town that features an unspoiled beach and places to hike and observe native birds.

There are two notable historic sites in South Bristol. The S Road School, built in 1860, is a one-room schoolhouse that features artifacts from the town's heyday.

The Thompson Ice House showcases the town's history as an ice-making stronghold. You can inspect how ice was harvested and stored before refrigeration. It's especially fun to visit during the annual ice harvest in February or the ice cream social in July.

The Boothbay Region encompasses miles of pristine land in the beautiful state of Maine, and South Bristol is a great starting point to explore the whole region. Boothbay Harbor is only 30 miles away and offers a wealth of cultural and natural activities. Charming Edgecomb features historic Fort Edgecomb, and Wiscasset is home to beautiful Softwell Memorial Forest and Morris Farm.

Enjoy the pristine natural surroundings of this beautiful region at one of our South Bristol vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Southport/
Much like the rest of coastal Lincoln County, Southport, Maine affords guests scenic vistas, tranquil neighborhoods, and a rugged coastline nonpareil. Settled by Europeans in 1623 and once called Cape Newagen Island, Southport incorporates the tiny villages of Southport, West Southport, Cape Newagen, and Squirrel island.

Today it has less than 1,000 year-round residents, making our Southport, Maine vacation rentals a choice spot for solitude seekers. Nature lovers flock here for the bountiful grasslands and bird- and whale-watching sites. Lighthouse aficionados head here to admire two restored lights. Hikers come every summer and fall to traverse the 12 acres of peaceful tree-covered terrain near the ocean. It's Maine like it should be seen.

Like its bigger sisters to the north - Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, and East Boothbay - Southport boats myriad natural wonders. First-time visitors should hike the 12-acre, half-mile loop of the Hendricks Head Trail - operated by the Boothbay Land Trust - an easy hike, but one that has a few steep and slippery climbs. End the hike at the Hendricks Head Lighthouse at the mouth of the Sheepscot River. Originally constructed in 1829, the 40-foot brick lighthouse and the two-story cottage adjacent are the keepers of spooky tales, such as the infamous "Ghostlady of the Dark" who is said to wander the grounds late at night.

Cuckolds Lighthouse, built in 1892, sits on the opposite end of the island on a separate outcropping and boasts a short tower and a small inn. The Hendricks Hill Museum along the main thoroughfare features artifacts from the ancestors of current island residents as well pictures and navigational instruments.

Lincoln County offers abundant natural wonder in towns inside its environs.

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/West-Bath/
Straddling the New Meadows River and Casco Bay, West Bath, Maine, welcomes visitors with a lovely bucolic coastal ambiance like no other. You'll find hidden coves and salt marshes galore. Kayak on Dam Cove or sail along the shore - it's all doable from one of our West Bath vacation rentals.

Situated in Sagadahoc county south of Portland, West Bath lies between Brunswick and Bath and has a modest population of nearly 1,800 year-round residents over 12 square miles.

West Bath is known for two historic sites that attract visitors from around Maine. The Old West Bath Meeting House, built in 1839 and maintained solely by volunteers, boasts antique kerosene lamps and stained glass windows. It's a popular spot even today for weddings, lectures, art shows, and other events. The Littlefield School was built in 1853 and still stands as one of the few remaining one-room schoolhouses in the state.

In Newcastle you can tour the Frances Perkins Homestead to learn about the US's first female cabinet secretary, or explore the banks of the  Damariscotta River at the 521-acre Dodge Point Public Reserved Land. With numerous fishing sites, it's no wonder anglers head to charming Nobleboro.

#Pathname:/usa/Maine/Wiscasset/
Our growing selection of Wiscasset, Maine vacation rentals provide the perfect home base to explore the rolling hills, freshwater streams, and plentiful wildlife make Wiscasset one of the main draws in Lincoln County. Friendly locals and a wealth of mom-and-pop shops lining Main Street keep the in-the-know tourists coming. With a long a fishing history, Wiscasset today enjoys a reputation as a boating and wetland mecca as well as the "worm capital of the world" (no wonder anglers love this place). Scenic rivers boast trout, and the bay and ocean are full of clams, lobster, and mussels.

Stay at one of our traditional Wiscasset vacation rentals and you'll see why this charming village continues to enthrall Maine visitors and locals alike.

Sandwiched between quaint Edgecomb and charming Dresden, Wiscasset is located in Lincoln County, in midcoast Maine, near Boothbay Harbor. It boasts more than 2,000 acres of preserved land, much of it part of a historic greenbelt.

If you love nature, you'll love Wiscasset. You can enjoy solitude, hiking nearly 20 miles of trails. Start in the village and enjoy the historic homes and scenic harbor views. The West Woods and Morris Farm trail will lead you through 200 acres of land, over streams and bridges and through the Sortwell Memorial Forest and Morris Farm. The latter is operated by a trust that encourages sustainable farming and hosts educational programs. You can admire Clydesdale horse, holstein cows, and a resident goat. The Water Trail is just what it says: a trail down the Back River that is best enjoyed in a kayak or canoe. The Back River Trail on the Cushman Mountain Reserve takes you through woodland and meadows to a scenic outlook. End your day traversing forest and salt marshes on Chewonki Neck, concluding at historic Eaton Farm.

More than 200 years old and made of granite slabs, the 1812 Jail is one the most visited sites in town. Once the jail for the entire state, it stopped housing prisoners in 1953. Today, guests can tour the facility and see what life was like for the 50 prisoners that were housed here, as well as the jailkeeper's family, who lived next door. Castle Tucker is a well-maintained Regency-style mansion that was built in 1807 and renovated in 2014. Once the home of a prominent shipping family, visitors can tour the interior and gardens and enjoy picture-perfect views of the Sheepscot River. A barn and carriage house still remain.

Another historic home built in 1807 that is well worth a visit is the Federalist-style Nickels-Sortwell House. Once a private residence, then a tavern and hotel, then a residence again, the home came into semi-public hands in 1958. You can admire antique wing chairs, braided rugs, and various portraits of the former owners.

Wiscasset is also known for its art galleries featuring local artists. The Wiscasset Bay Gallery highlights 18th, 19th, and 20th century paintings and sculpture, including works by William Trost Richards, Charles Woodbury, and Abraham Bogdanove.

Like other towns in the region, Wiscasset is a great base from which to seek day trips. The region is home to beautiful wetlands, great fishing sites, hiking and camping trails galore, and scenic lighthouses and sea vistas, along with many other charming small towns. Edgecomb is just next door, as are East Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Boothbay, and Nobleboro.

With a plethora of great hiking and kayaking trails, as well as historic homes worth a tour, it's no wonder Wiscasset is a traveler's paradise. Our Wiscasset vacation rentals provide the perfect retreat to explore this coastal wonderland.

Pack your bags, bring your family or a few friends, and come to one of Maine's hidden hideaways and enjoy some fresh-from-the-traps Maine lobster!

From the glistening waves of Long Sands Beach to the buzzing boardwalk of Short Sands, York combines the quaintness of small town New England with the sand and surf of the mighty Atlantic for a casual atmosphere of family fun and relaxation. It's packed with opportunities to explore historic sites and well-known tourist spots.

Exhausted from the hustle and bustle of the big city? Our York vacation rentals allow you to escape from it all and satisfy the urge that only the feeling of sand between your toes can soothe!

A vacation in York Beach practically plans itself! Watch the tides roll in and out from the comfort of a lounge chair along the shore of one of the town's two beaches. Long Sands stretches for nearly two miles and offers views of the noble Nubble Lighthouse. Surf the rolling waves to epitomize seaside cool and achieve the perfect windswept hairstyle. Duck out of the sun for a sandwich or some soft serve on the boardwalk. Don't worry about having to dress up - casual dining establishments where flip flopped feet are welcome are abundant on the boardwalk!

Family-friendly Short Sands is only a quick walk or trolley ride away and families with younger children will find hours of entertainment there. Though smaller than its sister beach, Short Sands has a public playground, several basketball courts, a lush open lawn area, and a bustling boardwalk. Once you've perfected the ultimate sandcastle at the beach, make the short trek into town for a sweet reward or to browse the trinkets and souvenirs in the quirky shops . Watch the hypnotic motion of the taffy pullers through the windows of The Goldenrod, a can't-miss-it destination where York's salt water taffy connoisseurs have been prepping and packaging their famous taffy "Kisses" (and other irresistible confections) since 1896.

York's Wild Kingdom, a zoo and amusement park combo, is a popular destination for those looking to take a break from the beach with the kids. Take a ride on the Ferris Wheel and enjoy a unique and heightened perspective of the town!

When the happiest hour of the day rolls around, there is no swankier place to be than on the deck at Gigi's Italian Restaurant for custom cocktails and half-priced oysters.

Short Sands is also the main venue for "York Days" which takes place annually in August and features a sandcastle building contest, a craft fair, and a softball tournament. Offering attractions and activities for guests of all ages and interests, York Days culminates in a fireworks show at the end of the weekend.

No stay at York Beach is complete without a trip (or two!) to the Nubble Lighthouse, a literal beacon of light located at the tip of the rocky bluff of Sohier Park. A popular Northeast tourist attraction, the Nubble is both stalwart and charming and is prominently featured in family photos of those who visit the area. The Nubble is the perfect backdrop for an after dinner stroll or an early morning run. Savor a juicy lobster roll or the final licks of favored ice cream flavor "Maine Survivor" from on-site restaurant Fox's Lobster House while snapping photos. Unwavering and photogenic, the Nubble always looks good in pictures!

York Beach is only twelve and a half miles North from hours of shopping at the Kittery Outlets. On the way to Kittery, sample fresh gourmet bread at the When Pig's Fly Bakery and test fine jams and jellies at Stonewall Kitchen's flagship store.

#Pathname:/usa/Maryland/Ocean-City/
Maryland is filled with bonafide summer playgrounds, and one of its premier vacation spots is Ocean City. Ever since the Algonquins came here to fish hundreds of years ago, this coastal town three hours from Washington, D.C., has been a hotbed of activity...and our selection of Ocean City vacation rentals provide the perfect home base to explore this fun-filled area!

The Europeans first arrived in the early 1500s, but it wasn't until 1875 that Ocean City became synonymous with summer fun. With numerous outdoors activities - from sunbathing to windsurfing to horseback riding to biking - and a plethora of cultural sites, Ocean City enthralls all who visit. Every summer, thousands of people head to its sunny shores to eat, drink, and be merry. Try your hand at fishing for white marlin (the city is the world capital of the sport!), join a day camp in the activity of your choice, or venture on a sailboat and tour the barrier islands. Whatever you choose to do, our Maryland vacation rentals are the perfect home base for your family vacation in this scenic 10-mile coastal wonderland.

The historic boardwalk should fall under the can't-miss category on your itinerary. Originally built in 1900, the three-mile wooden gangway features food, arcade, and shopping options for the entire family. Take your bike down the wooden planks and try a bit of saltwater taffy - or a world-renowned Maryland crab cake. Ride the 100 year-old carousel at Trimper's Rides. The Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum sits on one end of the boardwalk and features exhibits and memorabilia about the Worcester County coastal region and the origins of the U.S. Coast Guard. Children will love the aquarium and shipwreck exhibitions. Another boardwalk attraction is Ripley's Believe it or Not!, featuring more than 500 oddities that have to be seen to be believed (there's even a real shrunken head!).

The Ocean City Center for the Arts boasts a two-story gallery that includes an art library and pottery studio. Exhibits change monthly and feature local and regional artists. The town has a couple of lovely green spaces at which to picnic and take in the scenery. The 58-acre Northside Park is the largest in town, and offers guests baseball fields and a soccer field as well as a fishing lagoon and expansive gym. Little Salisbury Park is a local favorite, with two tennis courts and a basketball court as well as the town's art league.

What would Ocean City be without sun, sand and surf? The 10-mile beach is what attracts visitors each summer, and it's where most spend the majority of their stay. Frolic in the waves, kite surf, or fly a kite on a warm summer's day. You can watch for dolphins or professionals at work building sand castles. Kids will love the beach volleyball nets and the weekly Family Beach Olympics (through July and August). The beach plays host to movie nights, as well as concerts and firework extravaganzas.

Nearby Assateague Island is a site to behold. A protected national seashore, you get secluded sandy beaches amid coast bays on this barrier island eight miles south of Ocean City. Look for the famous Assateague's wild horses, descendants of the domesticated variety who roam this barren land freely, or try your had at clam digging. The beach will draw you but the horses will make you return year after year.

Ocean City is situated on the Maryland-Delaware border, making it an easy gateway to the mid-Atlantic region. You're not far from the sleepy coastal hamlets of Maryland's eastern shore, nor sports-centric Baltimore or beautifully-maintained Annapolis, the state capital. Washington D.C. is also just a couple of hours away, as are the historic Virginia and Maryland towns that surround our nation's capital.

Sun and fun await you in this historic summer playground. Our Ocean City vacation rentals are your best bet to take in this action-packed town on the state's Atlantic coast!

You've heard of the white cliffs of Dover, but here you can admire the red cliffs of Aquinnah! ?Considered a national landmark, these well-preserved red clay cliffs beckon everyone who arrives on the Vineyard. You can admire them up close at Moshup Beach, one of the town's only public beaches, or at the overlook atop the attraction.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Barnstable/
Lying midway on the Cape's "arm," the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, is one of historic splendor and coastal wonder. From a well-maintained and busy harbor to historic structures dating back to the mid-19th century, Barnstable was founded in 1638 and incorporates seven villages - from bustling Hyannis to quaint Barnstable to historic Cotuit - making it the largest town on the Cape. Our selection of Barnstable vacation rentals provide the most authentic way to experience this charming region!

Mom-and-pop shops abut traditional gray clapboard homes, making one feel as if he or she has stepped into the past. Preservationists have doggedly worked to maintain the historic nature of the villages - more than 75 structures are on the National Register of Historic Places - and with notable residents such as Kennedys, the visitors keep coming. Our Cape Cod vacation rentals in Barnstable offer traditional accommodations, with a bit of modernity thrown in. This summer, why not head to one of our Barnstable homes and see for yourself why this town is a destination nonpareil on the Cape?

Barnstable will keep you occupied however long you stay - and thanks to its historic sites and museums, you'll be entertained rain or shine. The Cahoon Museum of American Art in Cotuit showcases the work of Ralph and Martha Cahoon and other 19th century pieces. The Trayser Museum was once the custom house and post office but is now the U.S. Coast Guard Heritage Museum and boasts a 17th century jail and lighthouse.

One of the most popular spots in town is the Kennedy Compound. The former home of family Patriarch Joe Kennedy as well as his sons JFK, Robert, and Ted, the expansive estate features three houses and other structures on six acres of prim coastline. After Ted's death, the family donated the main house to the Edward Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate in 2012 to host public seminars and tours. The project remains ongoing, but you can still take pics and admire the Camelot splendor from afar. The John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum celebrates the legacy of our 35th president, and his love of Cape Cod.

History buffs should head directly to the Olde Colonial Courthouse. One of the oldest courthouses in the United States, this wooden structure played a pivotal role in the founding of our nation. It's here in 1774 that Samuel Adams and more than 1,500 men interrupted the King's Court proceedings that sought to deny a trial by jury for colonists. Today, it hosts "Tales of Cape Cod," a lecture series recording the voices of past Cape Codders.

Of course, Barnstable is also known for its duney beaches abutting the Atlantic. Sandy Neck Beach Park is one of the Cape's finest, with miles of dunes, marshes, and forests featuring local wildlife. Craigville Beach is on the Nantucket Sound and is popular with kite surfers in the summer.

With its unique position on the "bicep" of the Cape, Barnstable is the perfect base from which to explore the region, from forearm to upper arm. Our Barnstable vacation rentals make it easy. Hyannis is the transport hub, and offers flights to and from cosmopolitan Boston as well as flights and ferry service to tony and windswept Nantucket and beguiling Martha's Vineyard.

The towns of Dennis, Yarmouth, Falmouth, Plymouth, and Sandwich are less than an hour away, and each offers a multitude of delights, from historic structures to duney beaches to cozy restaurants where everyone is treated like a local. The rest of the Cape, from gay-friendly Provincetown to vintage Chatham, is just a drive away.

Sail around Boston Harbor or take a cruise to view historic sites such as Georges Island. Every October, thousands head to the banks of the Charles River to view the two-day Head of the Charles Regatta, a rowing competition featuring teams from universities and racing clubs around the country. The Charles River Esplanade and Cambridge are both hotspots for joggers, cyclists or anyone wanting a romantic picnic amid lush greenery.

Boston is a great base from which to explore Massachusetts or other New England states.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Chatham/

The Caleb Nickerson House, circa 1772, is a classic example of colonial architecture, with wooden wainscoting and pine board floors. The Josiah Mayo House, circa 1820 (and thus downright modern by comparison), transports visitors to the past and celebrates Chatham's first postman.

Had enough of historic homes? The Chatham Railroad Museum sits in the town's railroad depot and boasts locomotives from the 1939 New York World's Fair as well as a wooden caboose from the early 1900s. Or, pay a visit to the cast-iron Chatham Lighthouse, established by Thomas Jefferson, which has protected ships since 1808.

When you book one of our Cape Cod summer rentals in Chatham, you're never far from the water - and the town offers six saltwater beaches to please everyone in your party. Chatham Lighthouse Beach, with its eponymous historic lighthouse, is the most popular during the warmer months. Harding‘s Beach boasts warmer and calmer waters, due to its position on Nantucket Sound. Schoolhouse Pond and Forest Beach are great for families with small children, and Oyster Pond Beach is conveniently close to town. Dogs are welcome in the early morning and evening on Pleasant Bay Beach (perfect for guests staying in one of our pet-friendly Chatham rentals!), and Pleasant Street Beach is also close to nearby Harwich.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Dennis/
With 16 beaches and stately colonial mansions lining the water's edge, it's no wonder Dennis, Massachusetts, is one of the most popular towns for booking a Cape Cod vacation rental. This all-American city mixes recreation with art, shopping, and dining establishments galore.

The town incorporates five villages - Dennis, East Dennis, South Dennis, West Dennis and Dennis Port - and each offers a unique feel.

Today, Dennis is a seaside resort that lures thousands of tourists each year. Our selection of Dennis vacation rentals allow one to explore this beautiful coastal town, and the entire Cape Cod region.

Dennis is a popular summer resort, and that means visitors head to the many beaches in the area. Dennis has 16 public and residential beaches on the ocean, as well as two on a lake.

Northside saltwater beaches feature handicap facilities, boardwalks, and mobile snack bars. The best of the bunch are Mayflower Beach and Corporation Beach. The former features acres of soft duney sand, and midday low tides allow one to walk far into the ocean. The latter is kid- and dog-friendly (dogs are allowed off-leash after Labor Day), with grassy spots to grab sand crabs.

Southside beaches offer warmer water thanks to Nantucket Sound. Head to West Dennis Beach, one of the most popular in the summer, if you're a windsurfer. Sea Street Beach in Dennis Port boasts plenty of sand and gorgeous views, and is less touristy than other area beaches. Haigis Beach features a family-friendly vibe thanks to a playground and small waves.

Fishing and windsurfing are popular activities through the warmer months, and you'll be hard-pressed to stay indoors when the balmy breezes waft from the shore.

Built on nearly nine acres, the Falmouth Pumping Station, circa 1898, features a stock house, chlorination tanks, and a water treatment building around Long Pond. Nobska Lighthouse in Woods Hole overlooks Martha's Vineyard and dates back to 1826, although the current tower was built 50 years later.

The other villages of Barnstable are worth a visit, especially nearby Cotuit, which boasts the Cahoon Museum of American Art and the Cotuit Center for the Arts. The former features folk paintings as well as 19th and 20th century and contemporary American art. The latter showcases area talent via plays, concerts and art.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Nantucket/
With pristine beaches, well-preserved lighthouses, award-winning restaurants and annual arts and sports festivals, Nantucket is one of the most alluring islands off the East Coast. Offering a slower pace of life amid soft ocean breezes and tranquil shores, you may find you won't be able to get enough of it (well-traveled Nantucket homeowners like Senator John Kerry and New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick certainly haven't). For your first visit or your fiftieth, our Nantucket vacation rentals will make your stay on "The Grey Lady" a memorable one.

Situated 30 miles from the shores of Cape Cod, Nantucket can be reached by air and sea. Cape Air flies direct from Providence, Rhode Island; Boston, New Bedford, Hyannis and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts; and White Plains, New York. Charter airlines offer flights as well, and the high-speed ferry from Hyannis and Harwich Port leaves daily. Most Nantucket Island rentals are concentrated in Nantucket Town (or just "Town", to the locals).

Nantucket is a quintessential Massachusetts summer colony, and mainlanders flock in droves to the island in July and August. While a stay in a Nantucket summer house is a lovely getaway, if you can swing it, shoulder season is a great time to visit for a more authentic experience. Rent a bike and glide down the island’s 50 miles of well-paved bike path. You’ll spy a 1,000-acre nature preserve full of scrub oak in the Middle Moors, as well as the marshy Pout Ponds and Altar Rock, the fourth-highest elevation on the island.

Nantucket wouldn't be famous if it wasn't for its three lighthouses, two of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Situated on different corners of the island, guests can visit the well-maintained Brant Point Light, Sankaty Head Light, and Great Point Light - all in one day!

Jethro Coffin House is the oldest residence on the island, and has been lovingly restored to its former glory. The Whaling Museum offers a glimpse into the island's past, and features a restored 19th-century candle factory and a sperm whale skeleton. Stroll down the streets of the Nantucket Historic District to get a sense of how the island transformed from a remote outpost to the tony enclave it is today. On these quiet lanes, it's almost as if time has stood still.

Each of Nantucket's numerous beaches offers a unique experience. The north shore boasts warmer water and smaller waves (on this side of the island, head to Jetties Beach). Surfside on the south shore is popular with locals and tourists alike. The east and west shore beaches suffer from heavy currents and a bit of soil erosion, but Great Point and 'Sconset Beach are the best bets. You can spy seals at play at the former, and the latter began its history as a home to deck hands on furlough from whaling ships.

Duney beaches, outdoor havens, and historic architecture draw visitors back year after year - and you can explore it all from one of our Nantucket vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Oak-Bluffs/

Once a part of nearby Edgartown, Oak Bluffs became its own community in 1880 (it was formerly dubbed Cottage City). Named for the oak groves that grew along the bluffs overlooking Nantucket Sound, Oak Bluffs has long been a tourism stronghold. In the 19th century, tourists arrived from the mainland via steamer and shopped, danced, and swam to their hearts' content. Today, thousands of visitors head here each summer to swim in the warm waters of the Sound and to enjoy concerts, art festivals, and other activities throughout the season.

#Pathname:/usa/Massachusetts/Salem/
Witchcraft comes to mind when one thinks of Salem, Massachusetts - as the site of the infamous Salem Witch Trials of 1692, it's no wonder this city north of Boston has a spooky reputation. But to think of Salem as a destination only for lovers of the macabre would be a disservice to this unique town.

Salem boasts historic sites, top-notch museums and outdoor activities galore, making it one of the most popular destinations in the Northeast. Settled by Europeans in 1626, the town has managed to retain its easy-going vibe as it offers many big-city amenities. Our Salem vacation rentals are the perfect home base for exploring all the haunted or non-haunted happenings in this coastal Massachusetts town.

Salem boasts myriad sites that delight historians and literature buffs alike. The most famous of these is The House of the Seven Gables. Named after the Nathaniel Hawthorne Gothic novel of the same name, the Colonial Revival mansion was home to philanthropist Caroline O. Emmerton's Settlement Program, which trained 19th-century immigrants in English, homemaking, and work skills. It continues its philanthropic endeavors today with language and cognition classes as well as work prep and training, and also showcases Hawthorne's life in Salem and beyond.

The Peabody Essex Museum houses art, architecture, and New England culture. Of particular note is the museum's extensive collection of 19th-century Asian photography and Asian, Native American, and Oceanic art. Salem Pioneer Village 1630 celebrates the city's Puritan heritage and features actors depicting 17th-century colonial life. Meander through three acres of authentic colonial dugouts, wigwams, and thatched-roof homes.

Of course, when it comes to spooky comings and goings, you can't beat Salem. The Salem Witch Museum is one of the most visited sites in town, thanks to its authentic trial documents from the Salem witch hunt. Docents lead guests through stage sets and other artifacts about the mass hysteria that swept the town in 1692. Three other museums boast creepy exhibits, sets, and reenactments for the whole family: The Witch Dungeon Museum, The Witch History Museum, and The New England Pirate Museum lure tourists with their macabre tales of Salem's past. Every October, the town is bursting at the seams with visitors thanks to the many Halloween events. From parades to costume balls to family film screenings, more than 250,000 enjoy the fun every year.

If you ever get tired of seeing the historic sites, guests in our Salem vacation rentals will find many places to while away the hours outdoors, from hiking to picnicking and everything in between. The Salem Maritime National Historic Site preserves the city's nautical history and encompasses nearly 10 acres of waterfront land, including the Derby, Hatch's, and Central wharves and the U.S. Customs House, as well as a replica tall ship.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Bandon/
With a world-class golf course and one of the most beautiful beaches along the entire Oregon Coast, quiet Bandon is truly a can't-miss destination. Perched at the point where the winding Coquille River empties into the Pacific on the Southern Oregon Coast, a stay in one of our Bandon vacation rentals will leave you feeling utterly relaxed - or pleasantly exhausted from all your adventures. In Bandon, you can have it both ways!

Bandon is famous as the home of the Bandon Dunes Golf resort, with jaw-dropping ocean views right from the courses, but there's much more to this charming town than first meets the eye. The beach itself, for one, offers some of the most picturesque sunsets scenery, with jutting rocks breaking out of the long stretch of sand.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Astoria/
The charming seaport of Astoria, Oregon sits along precarious hilltops above the Columbia River, just before it flows into the Pacific Ocean. As the oldest American settlement west of the Rockies, it's hard to say what her biggest claim to fame might be: bustling fishing docks and canneries, spectacular shipwrecks, historic Lewis & Clark sites... who are we kidding? It's The Goonies. The cult classic was filmed here, and the labyrinth of Victorian homes dangling from the hillsides will be instantly recognizable to any fan.

Beyond its pop culture significance, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Astoria offers visitors a diverse selection of attractions and activities unlike any other town along the Northern Oregon Coast. History buffs can follow in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark in the surrounding state parks, or spend time at the Columbia River Maritime Museum learning about the area's traditions of fishing, shipping, and tragic shipwrecks (or, visit shipwrecks in person along the coast!).

Fans of food and drink will be delighted to find a number of waterfront bistros, casual fish houses, and a few highly regarded microbreweries; don't miss out on the spectacular views and hoppy IPA's at Fort George Brewery. Families will enjoy admiring the towering mural on the Astoria Column, and climbing to the top for jaw-dropping views of the ocean and surrounding mountains. In the summertime, kids love to spot fishing boats and sea lions from a seat on the historic riverfront trolley. Outdoor enthusiasts won't want to miss Fort Stevens State Park just outside the city limits, with sandy beaches, miles of hiking trails, excellent bird watching, freshwater lakes, swimming, and horseback riding.

An Astoria, Oregon vacation rental is just under two hours' drive from Portland, and just over three from Seattle. Although surrounded by natural beauty, you'll find all the amenities of city life in a charming small-town setting; yes, even a good local coffeehouse! While vacation rentals are generally prohibited in Astoria proper, its neighbor to the south - the quiet beachfront town of Gearhart - offers a wide variety of great vacation options. While you're there, enjoy the bustling boardwalks of Seaside, or head across the spectacular Astoria-Megler Bridge to Washington's beautiful Cape Disappointment State Park.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Arch-Cape/
Quiet Arch Cape is a tucked-away hamlet two miles south of Cannon Beach, and an Oregon Coast vacation rental here is just the place to find peace and solitude along the beautiful shores of the Northern Coast. Primarily a residential community, you won't find any souvenir shops or saltwater taffy here... and that's just the way Arch Cape likes it. Those amenities are within easy reach, but the town itself feels much more remote and hidden away than its busier, more touristy counterparts. For reflection, romance, and a true sense of getting away from it all, a relaxing Arch Cape vacation rental is the ultimate Oregon Coast destination.

For lovers of the great outdoors, Arch Cape is centrally located between Oswald West State Park and Hug Point. Oswald West offers a number of hikes for both experienced and novice explorers, ranging from the muddy climb up to panoramic Cape Falcon or an easy stroll to surfer-friendly Short Sands Beach. Hug Point is a more intimate destination, with a seasonal waterfall and portions of beach only accessible at low tide, making for a truly isolated Oregon coast experience. To get out and explore the water a little closer-up, consider booking a tour from Kayak Tillamook on the North Fork of the Nehalem River.

All the commercial amenities a vacationer could need are just four miles north in Cannon Beach, one of the Oregon Coast's most popular beach communities. Wine bars, art galleries, boutiques, and pizza parlors are within easy reach, but the weekend crowds remain behind as you return to peaceful Arch Cape. Manzanita, only ten miles south, offers a slower pace than Cannon Beach but amenities such as a pub, grocery store, and a few charming galleries and shops.

Just over an hour and a half from Portland, and under four hours from Seattle, a cozy Arch Cape vacation rental offers plenty of peace and relaxation to soothe away the stress of daily life... an undiscovered gem along the Northern Oregon Coast.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Barview/
The little town of Barview is a fisherman's dream, but also makes an excellent home base for an Oregon Coast vacation rental for any visitor hoping to explore the Northern Oregon Coast. Barview sits on the mouth of Tillamook Bay, between the resort town of Rockaway Beach and the busy little seaport of Garibaldi. The surrounding inland lakes and rivers make for an outdoorsman's paradise. Boating, crabbing, kayaking, hiking, beach combing, surfing, and of course fishing are just some of the area's popular activities. Everything you could need, from a guided charter to a simple crab pot, can be rented within a few miles of town.

Beach walkers and bird watchers will adore the location of Barview vacation rental. The sandy shores begin in nearby Barview Jetty County Park, and stretch northward for nearly eight miles, past the scenic Twin Rocks, to Rockaway Beach. While the obvious attraction here is the Pacific, don't neglect the beautiful Tillamook State Forest just to the east. The evergreen-covered mountains provide plenty of scenic hikes, including one that leads to the tallest waterfall in the Coast Range at Munson Creek Falls State Park, just half an hour from Barview.

For dining and shopping, Barview has a few select options, but most of the activity will be found in Garibaldi (2.5 miles away), Rockaway Beach (4 miles) or, for "big-city" amenities, Tillamook (12 miles). Along with a larger selection of restaurants and supermarkets, Tillamook offers plenty of rainy-day attractions: tastings & tours at the famous Tillamook Cheese Factory, enjoying a more low-key cheese experience at the lovely Blue Heron French Cheese Company), viewing restored WWII-era aircraft at the Tillamook Air Museum, or learning about the region's past at the Tillamook County Pioneer Museum.

A Barview vacation rental along the Northern Oregon Coast makes it an ideal home base for those seeking a peaceful retreat. The town has less hustle and bustle than most beach towns, but still offers wonderful scenery and is close to the region's star attractions. Within an hour to the north lie the tourist destinations of Cannon Beach and Seaside; to the south, explorers will delight in the Three Capes Scenic Drive, with its historic lighthouses and panoramic views. Portlanders can be in Barview in less than two hours, and Seattleites in just over four.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Beaver/
Beaver is a small community nestled along Highway 101 on the Oregon Coast. Travelers pass through this tiny town on their way to larger cities. This friendly area may not look like much - it has few residents and even fewer businesses - but it is a lovely place to visit. Check out Vacasa's offerings in this quiet region (or any of our other fantastic Oregon Coast vacation rentals) and enjoy a serene beach getaway.

With the ocean just a few miles west, and places such as Tillamook 15 miles north, Pacific City 13 miles down the highway, and Lincoln City just 30 miles south, the amenities of larger towns are not far away. With lush forests and plenty of small streams providing a gorgeous backdrop, you will love the tranquility of the region. And, with the Nestucca River that flows right through town, as well as the majestic ocean a short drive away, plus many state parks to explore, you will have many opportunities to take in the sights of the Northern Oregon Coast.

When you stay at one of our Oregon Coast vacation rentals near Beaver, you will enjoy a comfortable and inviting home surrounded by peace, quiet, and the beauty of nature.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Bay-City/
One of our Oregon Coast vacation rentals in little Bay City, a small enclave just south of Garibaldi, seems an unlikely destination for foodies. Yet this sleepy fishing village draws in out-of-towners with some of the freshest seafood in the state... and it makes a great home base, with plenty of peace and quiet, for exploring the rest of the Northern Oregon Coast. Whether you stay in a charming cottage or one of our Oregon Coast yurts, you're sure to find plenty to love in Bay City. Just off Highway 101, the must-eat spot in Bay City is the Fish Peddler restaurant in the Pacific Oyster processing facility. While not a white-tablecloth experience by any means, slurping shellfish doesn't get any fresher than this. The restaurant recently brought in a former McCormick and Schmick's executive to revamp the menu, which now features oyster po' boys and Dungeness crab cakes. If seafood's not your thing, they also offer locally-sourced burgers; head to the nearby Tillamook County Smoker to stock up on the jerky, sausage, and pepperoni they've been making for over 35 years. Of course, you can also pick up groceries and make a hearty feast (seafood or not) back in the full kitchen of your cozy Bay City vacation rental. While Bay City itself is quite small, its proximity to the star attractions of Tillamook County make it an ideal spot. Tillamook's Cheese Factory and Air Museum are perfect rainy day attractions. Head to the miles of sandy shoreline near Rockaway Beach for surfing, sand castle building, and kite flying, all within a ten-minute drive of Bay City. Don't miss out on the nearby Three Capes Scenic Drive, which begins just south of town, or hiking in the Tillamook State Forest to the east; popular Seaside & Cannon Beach are within an hour's drive north. Situated only an hour and a half from Portland, a Bay City vacation rental is an often-overlooked but worthy destination for a Northern Oregon Coast getaway.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Boring/
When you think of a Mt. Hood vacation rental, small, unassuming Boring, Oregon may not be your first choice. But, this friendly, peaceful community just 23 miles east of Portland is home to many restaurants, the Springwater Trail runs through town, and from here, you're only about 33 miles from skiing and snowboarding at Mt. Hood Skibowl, with other ski resorts right nearby. Boring even has a European sister city - Dull, Scotland. Like Molalla, a Boring vacation home is situated to easily enjoy many outdoor activities, but without the crowds. Spend the day at the Mountain View Golf Course, with its 18-holes and gorgeous views of the Cascade Mountain Range - this golf course also has a pro shop and on-site restaurant. Barton Park, just south of town, is a large natural area with fishing, a boat ramp, picnic area, and wildlife viewing. Spend a warm, sunny afternoon tubing in McIntyre Reservoir or kayaking along the Clackamas River, before returning back to your getaway to relax with a beer and some burgers on the outdoor grill. May through September, the Boring Farmers Market is open on Saturdays, from 10AM-3PM. Pick up some fresh vegetables or even eggs for a meal back at your Boring getaway, or even some arts and crafts to bring home from your vacation! But often times, the country roads here are lined with farmstands selling berries and vegetables, so you may be able to pick up a garden bounty any day of the week! And if you don't feel like cooking, Boring has a number of eateries - The Not So Boring Bar and Grill, Nuts on Sports Pizza, and in the mornings, be sure to stop by Knospe's Keen Bean Coffee. A Boring vacation rental puts you near all the activities in both Clackamas County and the greater Mt. Hood region, but with a laid-back pace and few crowds to cramp your style.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Brightwood/
Biking, hiking, fly fishing, snowshoeing, skiing - a Mt. Hood vacation rental in Brightwood puts you right in the middle of the Mt. Hood National Forest and all of its stellar year-round outdoor activities! But what of this little town with the unique name? Local history has it that in 1891, one Mr. Alcorn was so impressed with the way the spring sunlight lit up the cottonwoods around the "Salmon" post office (named after the nearby river), he dubbed the place, "Brightwood." It stuck. More than a century later, this charming mountain town isn't much bigger. A Brightwood vacation rental in the beautiful Mt. Hood region is right near the confluence of the Sandy and Salmon Rivers, what's outside the little village accounts for much of the draw. Reaching out like tendrils from just beyond the village are no less than 17 bike trails of varying lengths and difficulties, making Brightwood a cyclist's paradise. One of the most popular, the Sandy Ridge Trail, follows the Sandy River and meanders through a scenic wilderness, heavily populated with native trees and wildlife. You'll definitely want to pack your camera as well as your water bottle. Sandwiched between two rivers, it's also no surprise that one of the town's most popular pastimes is fishing. Go out on your own on the Sandy River or book a fly fishing adventure with The Fly Fishing Shop in nearby Welches. Whether it's biking, hiking, or fishing, Brightwood has all the recreational perks one would expect to find in a mountain forest at an elevation of 1,164 feet. And after a day's adventure, make your way to the Brightwood Tavern for beer, food, and to hang out with the locals. In winter, it's not far at all to many of the popular ski slopes that call the area around Mount Hood their home. Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood Skibowl, and Mount Hood Meadows are all within a 30 minute drive and snowshoeing and cross country skiing are even closer in the surrounding national forest back country. Brightwood is one of the unincorporated communities in the Mount Hood Corridor and easily accessible via Oregon's I-84 east and Scenic Byway (Highway 26). Only about an hour east of Portland, it's just a short, scenic drive before you reach your charming Brightwood vacation rental in the Mt. Hood forest, where good times abound and the trees are ablaze with sunlight!

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Brookings/
Vacasa's growing selection of Brookings, Oregon vacation rentals are ideally-situated to make the most of your getaway to the wild and scenic Southern Oregon Coast! This unique community is sometimes refereed to as "Oregon's Banana Belt," for its year-round sunny and warm weather - in fact, summer days in the 80's are not uncommon here. Just 30 miles to the south of Gold Beach and about seven miles from the California state line, Brookings offers gorgeous warm days and cooler nights for watching the stars from the beach or even roasting marshmallows around your Brookings beach cottage's backyard fire pit.

And while the beach, Macklyn Cove, and numerous tide pools at Harris Beach State Park are a huge draw to this magical Oregon Coast spot, Brookings is much more than just sand, surf, and starfish (although there is plenty of those)! There's a botanical garden to explore, the Oregon Redwoods Trail for glimpses of these historic, giant trees, and at the Port of Brookings Harbor you can have access to public boat ramps for a day out on the water, fishing for dinner. This harbor is known for its access to both the Pacific Ocean and Chetco River for Chinook salmon, as well as deep water steelhead, ling cod, and Dungeness crab.

What else can you do when you leave your Brookings beach cottage for the day? Well, golfers will want to schedule time at the Salmon Run Golf Course and for water sports enthusiasts, Sporthaven Beach is known for great surfing and body boarding. And in summer, the water is warm enough that you will probably not even need a wetsuit. From one of our Brookings, Oregon vacation rentals, you can also head to Sporthaven Beach to do a little whale watching in winter and spring. Brookings is also home to a popular Artisan Market on Saturdays (May - October), the Azalea Festival Memorial Day weekend, a Farmers Market (June - October), the Southern Oregon Kite Festival in July, and a large Art Festival in August.

But really, there is no bad time to visit this charming, ocean-side Oregon town! Pick one of our Brookings, Oregon vacation rentals for a comfortable and well-stocked home base while you explore the beautiful Southern Oregon Coast. Just be sure to bring your sunscreen, your beach toys...and your sense of adventure!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Cannon-Beach/
Meet Cannon Beach Cannon Beach is one of the Northern Oregon Coast's most popular getaways, but still offers the charm and peacefulness of a beach resort community. Tucked between the evergreen-covered mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, a Cannon Beach vacation rental is a treasure trove of beautiful scenery and natural attractions. The area is home to the iconic Haystack Rock, some of the coast's most lively tide pools, and spectacular seaside cliffs, while supporting a vibrant local business district and arts community. Some of the region's finest restaurants, wine bars, clothing boutiques, galleries, and local theaters dot the quaint downtown streets, making the area a prime Oregon Coast vacation rental destination for those who want to enjoy the finer things in life along with the rugged beauty of the Oregon Coast. Cannon Beach Outdoor Recreation The beach itself, considered one of the state's finest, is dominated by the monolithic Haystack Rock. At low tide, curious beachcombers can be found examining and photographing the starfish, sea anemone, and crabs that make their homes in the tide pools at the rock's base. The sandy white shores are popular with sand castle builders, kite fliers, swimmers, sunbathers, horseback riders, and four-legged Frisbee chasers alike. From your cozy beach house, beautiful state parks and recreation areas surround Cannon Beach, with a number of spectacular hikes and scenic vistas. Ecola State Park lies just north of town, and don't forget your camera. You'll want it as you hike up to the viewpoint at the Tillamook Head Lighthouse... or reach a deserted stretch of sand at the end of the Indian Beach Trail... or follow in Lewis & Clark's footsteps along the Clatsop Loop Trail. Other nearby attractions include the sandy shores at two state recreation areas, Arcadia Beach and Hug Point. Cannon Beach Attractions Carefully guarded development has kept many of the big-name chains out of Cannon Beach, resulting in a unique sense of community in the small town. Here, some family-run businesses have become local institutions, so don't be surprised when residents politely insist you try the bacon-wrapped dates at Sweet Basil Cafe or pick up a bottle of huckleberry balsamic vinegar at The Oil & Vinegar Bar. We suggest you take their advice! Only an hour and a half from Portland and under four hours from Seattle, a Cannon Beach vacation rental makes a great home base to explore the scenic Northern Oregon Coast. The more touristy attractions of Seaside, including the Promenade's souvenir shops, arcades, and buzzing atmosphere, are only fifteen minutes north on Highway 101; head south for a slower pace in sleepy Arch Cape (five minutes away) or laid-back Manzanita (twenty minutes).
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Cascade-Locks/
Given its northwestern location on the Columbia River, Cascade Locks is often regarded as the gateway to Hood River County. From your Columbia Gorge vacation rental in Cascade Locks, you'll be surrounded by the jaw-dropping vistas of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, where you'll discover an area renowned as a stellar place for sailing and windsurfing. But that's not all! In addition to its own airport, Cascade Locks has great dining, a marina and boat launch, grocery stores and shops. For sailors, there are the Columbia Gorge Racing Association Regattas. Cyclists can show their stuff on the Cascade-to-Crown Bicycle Ride. At Marine Park, you can hop on the Columbia Gorge Sternwheeler and experience the river the way old timers like Mark Twain did. Or, head over to the Historical Museum and check out the artifacts, photographs, and history of the region. Cascade Locks really is a gateway to the region, with a central location that makes it easy to explore both urban attractions and outdoor adventures. It's less than an hour to Portland and only 20 minutes to Hood River, so there's always a great restaurant or award-winning brewery within easy reach. On the Oregon side of the Gorge, numerous hikes lead to hidden waterfalls - or the not-so-hidden Multnomah Falls, the second tallest in the nation and only 13 miles from Cascade Locks. Just across the town's Bridge of the Gods, on the Washington side of the Columbia, more strenuous adventures beckon with steeper trails leading up to panoramic viewpoints at Beacon Rock and Table Mountain. Cascade Locks, though, is the lowest point on the Pacific Crest Trail, a journey that takes hikers from the Mexican border in California to the Canadian border. Each August, the city hosts a fundraiser for the trail on Thunder Island in the Columbia. If you're around in November, kick-start your holiday spirit with the annual "Lighting of the Bridge," when the structure is decked out in its holiday garb. In December, the city finishes its Christmas decorating with its "Festival of Light." No matter what time of year you stay in a Cascade Locks vacation rental, you're in for a memorable, fun-filled getaway!

On clear days, visitors might catch a glimpse of the tufted puffins and Steller sea lions who enjoy protected breeding grounds at the Three Arch Rocks Natural Wildlife Refuge to the southwest of Cape Meares.

Many vacationers along the Oregon Coast pass through Cape Meares as they journey along the Three Capes Scenic Route, a 40-mile loop drive that meanders along the shoreline from Pacific City to Tillamook. Even on rainy days, when you might be tempted to hunker down in your cozy Cape Meares beach cottage, the well-marked path at Three Capes is worth an afternoon's exploration, showing off some of Oregon's most panoramic viewpoints in state parks at Cape Lookout and Cape Kiwanda. Along the sandy beach of Cape Meares and in the surrounding parks, visitors can enjoy some of the best hiking, kayaking, kite-flying, crabbing, fishing, and birdwatching in the state.

While Cape Meares itself is very quiet, the community is only five minutes from Oceanside, with fresh seafood and homemade desserts at Roseanna's Cafe or Brewin' in the Wind. Within twenty minutes, Tillamook offers all the dining and shopping options of a larger town, plus the ultimate rainy-day activity: touring and tasting at the Tillamook Cheese Factory. Cape Meares makes a convenient home base for exploring the Oregon Coast, with a number of popular tourist destinations within an hour and a half's drive: Cannon Beach and Seaside to the north, Pacific City and Lincoln City to the south. Portland is under two hours away, and Seattle can be reached within four and a half hours. Close to the conveniences of "civilization" but offering a true sense of getting away from it all, a stay at a Cape Meares vacation rental is unmatched for its combination of natural beauty and peacefulness along the Northern Oregon Coast.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Depoe-Bay/
For a small town, Depoe Bay certainly has a mighty big reputation. This little village has become known as the "Whale Watching Capital of the Oregon Coast", and indeed, it draws a large number of visitors during peak weeks to the state's official Whale Watching Center downtown. An Oregon Coast vacation rental in Depoe Bay is still certainly quieter than Lincoln City to the north and Newport to the south, but thanks to its whale-watching fame, has more dining and shopping options available than many similarly-sized coast towns. In addition to her whale watching status, the town is also home to the world's smallest (and very photogenic) navigable harbor, underwater geyser-like basalt formations that spout water dozens of feet into the air, and a veritable fleet of charter boats from operators like Dockside Charters, ready to whisk curious visitors out on deep-sea fishing adventures and sightseeing tours. After having their fill of whale-watching, visitors could spend days exploring the scenic picnic spots, sandy beaches, and hidden coves located just outside Depoe Bay. South of town, the winding Otter Crest Loop guides drivers past jaw-dropping views and state recreation sites at Fogarty Creek, Boiler Bay, Rocky Creek, and Otter Crest, with its cheerfully named Cape Foulweather.

If you don't feel like preparing meals in your beach cottage's full kitchen, lucky diners can choose from four-star farm-to-table cuisine at Restaurant Beck, the insanely popular seafood spot Tidal Raves, or the Friday night seafood buffet at The Sea Hag, just to name a few. Depoe Bay is an excellent choice for visitors want to explore the busier, more bustling destinations of Newport and Lincoln City while still experiencing the charm and laid-back atmosphere of a smaller home base. Newport's famous aquarium, historic waterfront, and Rogue Brewing are only 20 minutes south; to the north, Lincoln City offers miles of sandy beaches, a lively nightlife scene, an outlet mall, and a casino. Portland can be reached in just under two and a half hours, while Salem and Corvallis are an hour and a half away.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Eugene/
You might be tempted to think that Portland is the star when considering a Portland / Willamette Valley vacation rental, but you'd be missing out on Eugene - recently ranked by Money Magazine as one of the six best cities to live in. Of course, you don't need to be a resident to enjoy everything this town offers! Bookstores, galleries, museums, the University of Oregon, restaurants, hiking and biking trails, wineries - the central part of the Willamette Valley has plenty going for it, not only for those seeking higher learning at U of O, but also for a fun-filled Oregon getaway!

The quintessential college town of Eugene is about a two hour drive south of Portland. Whether you're in town touring the university, attending a graduation ceremony, or just visiting some of the region's outstanding wineries, you'll enjoy the comfort of having your own Eugene vacation rental to return to while in town. Like a lot of other college towns, Eugene is also home to a thriving arts scene, including downtown art galleries, the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, Studio West for glass blowing (you can even take a class), the Maude Kearns Art Center on campus, and many other spaces devoted to the creative arts.

Within a 30-minute drive of your Eugene vacation rental, there are a number of Willamette Valley wineries to explore - such as Brigadoon Wine Company in Junction City, Domaine Meriwether in Veneta, and King Estate in the outskirts of southwest Eugene. It's a perfect fieldtrip on sunny afternoons or an excursion for parents while the teens are off getting a tour of the campus.

And don't overlook the University of Oregon when making your plans - it's not just for perspective students, but a great stop for tourists of all kinds! Take advantage of free campus parking for visitors and explore the Museum of Natural and Cultural History and ponder 15,000 years of human history...or just people-watch on the quad. Eugene also has its share of great seasonal events - there's the Cinema Pacific Film Festival in spring, the Oregon Bach Festival in summer, McKenzie River Chainsaw Art Festival in August, or you can attend an Oregon Ducks football game during the school year.

As one of the most active cities in the west, Eugene is well known for outdoor activities - cycling, running, and kayaking on the Willamette and McKenzie Rivers are all popular here. The Mount June Trail in nearby Cottage Grove is a 4.6 mile trail uphill that rewards hikers with amazing panoramic views of the Willamette Valley and the mountain peaks of both the Cascade and Coast Ranges. For golfers, the Laurelwood Golf Course is a 9-hole course with challenging hilly terrain and beautifully landscaped greens. And only about an hour from your well-appointed Eugene cottage, heading either west or east will take you to the Oregon Coast for surfing in the Pacific Ocean or the Cascade Mountains for skiing or snowshoeing.

The next time your travels take you to the Central Willamette Valley, arrange a stay in a Eugene vacation rental for a comfortable home base while exploring this unique and fun Oregon destination.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Florence/
The living is good in Florence, Oregon. With a charming downtown, easy access to amazing sandy beaches, and impressive sightseeing just outside of town, Florence is bigger than the average coastal town; over 6,000 lucky residents calling Florence home year-round. Still, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in town has a friendly and slower-paced atmosphere that puts visitors instantly at ease.

Florence sits on the Siuslaw River, separated from the Pacific by the northern end of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Wind-sculpted mountains of sand stretch for forty miles south, making a gorgeous backdrop for unusual activities such as dune-buggy-riding and sand boarding; or, simply take a blanket and a beach chair to enjoy some of the coast's most beautiful beaches.

For a different kind of scenery, head north from your Florence vacation rental about 12 miles to one of the Coast's most photographed spots, the elegant Heceta Head lighthouse at the stunning Devil's Elbow State Park. Nearby, the wildlife viewing made possible at the Sea Lion Caves will win over even those normally skeptical of roadside attractions. Back in Florence, the historic Old Town is a delightful waterfront business district, home to restaurants, antique shops, art galleries, and a history museum.

Eating well is not difficult in Florence. Plenty of seafood restaurants, chowder houses, and cafes line Bay Street, but make a special point to stop for the crab-encrusted halibut at local favorite The Waterfront Depot. The best beer list in town is found at the laid-back Beachcomber Pub, or for something less potent, grab a cup of freshly-roasted coffee at Siuslaw River Coffee Roasters and enjoy the waterfront views from the patio.

A Florence vacation rental is less than an hour and a half from Eugene, about two and a half hours to Salem, and just over three to Portland. Within two hours, visitors can be exploring the aquarium at Newport, enjoying the vistas of Cape Perpetua near Yachats, or golfing at the famous Bandon Dunes; but in all fairness, Florence herself offers plenty to keep the whole family busy, happy, and well-fed!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Garibaldi/
Garibaldi is a little bigger than most of the blink-and-you'll-miss-them towns that line Highway 101 along the Northern Oregon Coast, but not much. Despite its small size, however, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in this historic seaport has a lot to offer visitors. Some of the coast's freshest seafood, best fishing, and even killer karaoke can be found here in Garibaldi, assuming you know where to look. A Garibaldi vacation rental is nestled between the fishing haven of Tillamook Bay and the evergreen-covered mountains of the Coast Range. Fishing is one of this port town's most popular activities, with tuna, halibut, and several species of salmon drawing professional and amateur enthusiasts alike. And it's not just fishing; during crabbing season, the docks and piers along the bay are dotted with locals monitoring their pots and traps. Visitors can rent all the gear necessary to catch a tasty dinner (including boats) at the Garibaldi Marina, or let someone else handle the navigation on a fishing charter. For less effort and an equally delicious payoff, visit one of the delightfully crusty dockside fisheries for the freshest crab, oysters, and salmon possible. Bay Ocean Seafood is a good place to start for both prepared and ready-to-cook offerings. A few miles south, the Fish Peddler restaurant inside the Pacific Oyster processing facility in Bay City is a must-visit for seafood lovers. Watch the expert shuckers move oysters along the busy production line before settling into one of the freshest plates of seafood the Oregon Coast has to offer. For something a little different, venture out from your cozy cottage to Garibaldi's Ghost Hole Public House offers a casual atmosphere for enjoying a cold pint, and on Saturdays, some very unexpected karaoke action. A Garibaldi vacation rental is located near a number of the Northern Oregon Coast's most popular destinations. The picturesque beaches near Twin Rocks and Rockaway Beach are is just five minutes north, or head south to explore the scenic viewpoints and historic lighthouses along the Three Capes Scenic Route. Tillamook, with plenty of dining, shopping, and the Tillamook Cheese Factory is just ten minutes east. Within an hour from Garibaldi, visitors to the coast can stroll the Promenade at Seaside or browse the boutiques in Rockaway Beach. Plus, Garibaldi is just over an hour and a half from Portland and Salem. That's well worth it for the oysters alone.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Gold-Beach/
Just an hour south of Bandon, lies scenic and wild Gold Beach - home to long sandy beaches, picturesque hiking trails along the Rogue River, rocky headlands overlooking the Pacific, anemone-filled tide pools, and year-round family fun. An ideal location for a memorable stay at an Oregon Coast vacation rental, you'll be rewarded for heading off the beaten path a bit with uncrowded stretches of sand and a charming town to browse and discover during your Gold Beach getaway.

If you visit in September, you'll want to attend the Gold Beach Brew and Art Fest to sample a variety of microbrews, peruse crafts by local artists, listen to live music, and enjoy a number of food booths. From mid-summer to fall, there's crabbing and clamming along the shore, and in the off-season months of February through April, you may just be lucky enough to find a glass float hidden along the beach from Kissing Rock Wayside to the north side of the Rogue River jetty.

One thing is for sure, no matter when you escape to a Gold Beach vacation rental, you'll have a unique Oregon Coast experience - whether that includes hiking through an old growth forest, taking a jet boat tour of the Rogue River, or just relaxing on the back porch of your Gold Beach cottage, enjoying the stunning ocean view. If you need a hearty breakfast or lunch during your time in Gold Beach, head to the Indian Creek Cafe for hearty four-egg omelets and a plateful of fluffy pancakes. They open up at 5:30 AM each morning - it's a great stop before taking off on an ocean or river fishing trip. And while you're there sipping your latte, give resident cat Jack a friendly scratch behind the ears.

On the nights when you don't prepare a feast at your beach getaway, stop at Barnacle Bistro or Spinners for some of the freshest seafood around - from Dungeness crab to Chinook salmon. At five and a half hours from Portland and only 45 miles from the California border, Gold Beach is perfect for a longer, relaxing getaway to explore this region's great outdoors.

Plan a day trip down to Redwoods National and State Parks in California, hike through Oregon's Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, or spend a winter afternoon storm watching from a protected overlook or the cozy living room of your charming Gold Beach vacation rental.

The surrounding Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area is bursting with hiking trails and hidden waterfalls, as well as some of the state's best single-track for mountain bikers at Post Canyon. When the snow falls, the trails become a snowshoer or cross-country skier's paradise; for more thrilling rides, locals head up the mountain to Cooper Spur or Mt. Hood Meadows for alpine skiing and snowboarding. Long before Hood River became the place to be for windsurfing, its was renowned for its apples and pears. (It is regarded as one of the premier producers of Anjou pears in the world.) The scenic Hood River Fruit Loop meanders through the valley, with ample opportunities to buy uber-local produce, jams, and honey at picturesque farm stands. Take your tasty haul back to your Hood River cabin for the next day's breakfast, or make it a picnic at one of the surrounding wineries with stunning Mt. Hood views.

Today, not only are there more than a dozen wineries along the Hood River, the area is also home to award-winning breweries like Full Sail, Double Mountain, and Pfriem.

This wonderful community is about an hour directly west of Eugene, and just 15 minutes from charming Florence.

McMinnville, Oregon, is the perfect destination for anyone who loves wine and nature. Gently sloping hills give way to grape-studded land in this picture-perfect town, named for one of the Oregon Trail pioneers. Its location at the confluence of the North and South forks of the Yamhill River - just 35 miles southwest of Portland - makes it an ideal wine-growing destination.

The surrounding towns boast dozens of additional wineries for your imbibing pleasure, as well as myriad restaurants headed by star chefs crafting award-winning cuisine.

From your Molalla getaway, you can follow along the scenic Molalla River Corridor and view numerous waterfalls and geological features, hike, bike, skateboard, and shop to your heart's content.

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Manzanita/
Twenty minutes south of bustling Cannon Beach sits the sleepy town of Manzanita. With seven miles of sandy shoreline, an excellent handful of local businesses, and a laid-back vibe to soothe even the busiest soul, it's one of the best-kept secrets on the Northern Oregon Coast. An Oregon Coast vacation rental in Manzanita is the ideal destination for travelers who enjoy staying in a low-key environment with beautiful sandy beaches, but still having easy access to amenities such as grocery stores, coffee shops, and even a sports pub. The town of Manzanita is nestled at the base of Neahkahnie Mountain, a 1600-foot peak that juts out into the Pacific Ocean from the coast, providing a spectacular backdrop to the scenery along the beach. For hiking enthusiasts, trekking up to the Neahkahnie summit on a clear day is a must; the views along the shoreline down to Tillamook Bay are magnificent, and make the challenging climb well worth the effort. For those who prefer less strenuous activity, from your charming beach house, take a long walk along Manzanita's beach stretches from the base of the mountain to the Nehalem Bay Jetty, where seals lounge on rocks as pelicans and eagles fly overhead. Get up close and personal with the nearby Nehalem Bay on a coastal kayak tour. The town itself has just enough retail and restaurant options to meet the needs of most travelers, while feeling considerably more intimate than the more developed downtowns of Cannon Beach and Seaside. Along the main drag of Laneda Avenue, visitors can enjoy cardamom cinnamon rolls at the Bread & Ocean Bakery, a cold pint at the San Dune Pub, a well-earned massage at Spa Manzanita, and pick out a floatable Frisbee at Four Paws on the Beach; after all, Manzanita is one of the most dog-friendly spots along the Coast and we have a number of pet-friendly Manzanita vacation rentals to choose from! The town even offers a natural-foods grocery and a few lovely bookstores, perfect for browsing on rainy days. A Manzanita vacation rental will put you just fifteen minutes south of Cannon Beach's upscale boutiques and galleries, and within half an hour of Seaside's bustling boardwalks. Heading south along Highway 101, the fisheries and seafood markets near Rockaway Beach are only twenty minutes away and the bigger-city amenities (along with a certain cheese factory) are within a forty-minute drive to Tillamook. Manzanita is just under two hours' drive from Portland, and four hours from Seattle, making it easily accessible but certainly isolated and intimate enough to provide a truly relaxing Oregon Coast experience.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Mosier/
The community of Mosier has both an interesting history and a proximity to a myriad of outdoor activities going for it. From your own private Mosier vacation rental, you'll be able to discover all that makes this little town on the Columbia River something special! From cycling paths to windsurfing, Mosier offers world-class recreation and adventure, along with a delightful small-town charm that makes it a wonderful option for a Columbia River Gorge vacation rental. Mosier itself offers a handful of local businesses to meet travelers' most urgent needs - stop by 10 Speed Coffee for a morning cup, or head to Thirsty Woman Pub after a day's hike for a more potent kind of brew. There's also a small market for groceries. If you'd like a little more variety, you'll find that breweries, fine dining, and cafes abound in nearby Hood River, just seven quick miles down the highway. If you prefer to pedal your way to dinner, you're in luck. A pedestrian and bicycle route passes through the historic Mosier Twin Tunnels State Park, traveling through two historic tunnels along the Columbia River Scenic Highway just west of town. This cycling path is a must-ride attraction for bikers - and if you're looking for more challenging trails, stop in one of the cycle shops and ask for a map of the nearby Post Canyon single-track area! From your Mosier vacation rental, visit one of the many orchards in the area and pick your own world-renowned pears and apples. Or, check out one of the 19 wineries in the area and experience the sun-soaked, Columbia Gorge grape. In the winter, Mt. Hood Meadows offers alpine skiing and snowboarding, 40 miles up the mountain. If you're seeking a Columbia Gorge vacation rental that's convenient to recreation - but not too touristy - a Mosier vacation home may be the perfect choice!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Neskowin/
Just twenty minutes north of busy Lincoln City sits little Neskowin, one of the most pleasant "forgotten" towns along the Oregon Coast. Other than a historic golf course and a smattering of vacation getaways, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in sleepy Neskowin has few reasons to attract visitors or day-trippers. Yet the former fishing village has been known to charm those who do come here, bringing them back year after year to enjoy the area's ethereal beaches and hidden secrets. And, of course, all the restaurants, shopping, and entertainment one could desire are just a short drive down Highway 101 to Lincoln City. Neskowin's best-known landmark is Proposal Rock, a tree-topped rocky island named by an early settler after her daughter got engaged on the rock around the end of the 19th century. It's still known as one of the most romantic spots along the Oregon Coast. Other unique geographic features make strolling the beach in Neskowin especially engaging. A "ghost forest" of tree stumps, likely thousands of years old, appears during certain times along the beach, curiously protected, instead of eroded, by the sand and mud along the shore. The lack of crowds make this seemingly endless stretch of sand almost ethereal, and one of the most rewarding places to seek solitude along the coast. Of course, there are a number of more active ways to spend time while enjoying your Neskowin vacation rental. The hike along the Cascade Head Nature Preserve is one of the best along the coast. Kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and golfing are among the other popular activities in Neskowin. The town does have a small local market and a lovely art gallery, but the primary attraction here is certainly the beautiful beach. For additional dining and shopping options, Neskowin sits only fifteen minutes south of charming Pacific City (with its well-known Pelican Pub & Brewery) and twenty minutes north of tourist-friendly Lincoln City. A beach escape to a Neskowin vacation rental is just two hours from Portland, less than an hour and a half from Salem, and five hours from Seattle. The Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, the Cheese Factory in Tillamook, and the beautiful lighthouses along the Three Capes Scenic Drive are all within an hour of town... but once you experience the quiet allure of Neskowin, you may not want to leave at all.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/North-Bend/
Featuring an interesting location - surrounded on two sides by Coos Bay (the water mass) and two sides by Coos Bay (the city) - North Bend is a wonderful place to visit if you want a small-town atmosphere with no shortage of natural beauty. With the ocean, the famous sand dunes, rivers, and forests nearby, and all the amenities of a city, North Bend is one of the undiscovered hotspots of the coast. When you stay at one of our North Bend lodging options, or any of our Southern Oregon Coast vacation rentals, you will find yourself comfortable, relaxed, and ready to explore the area!

If you enter town from the north, you will drive across the North Bend Bridge (one of the most iconic on the coast) and have panoramic views of the dunes, forests, and the bay as you cross the mile-long bridge and reach the edge of the city. In North Bend you will find cultural influences of the Native Americans who originally settled this land, and the loggers and millers who lived here during the town's heyday. In fact, logging is still an important industry here, and the influences of Native Americans (especially the Coos tribe, who lend their name to the bay, river, county, and more) can be seen everywhere. The friendly, modern residents who live here now know that historic-and-charming North Bend is a great place to visit. Drive along the main roads - Sherman Avenue and Virginia Avenue especially - and see the mix of historic buildings housing art galleries and antique shops, and the newer buildings which host coffee shops and bookstores. You can go shopping at Pony Village Mall, visit the Coos Historical & Maritime Museum, and try your luck at The Mill Casino. When you choose our North Bend lodging, you will have easy access to all the attractions both in and around the city.

If you're familiar with the Oregon Coast, you know that it has spectacular coastline, ranging from sheer rocky cliffs to soft, supple sand dotted with tiny shells. North Bend may not be right on the ocean, but it's a quick drive over to the sandy shore. In fact, just north of town is the southern border of the famous Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, which is one of the very best places to go ATV-riding, sandboarding, off-roading, and hiking on the majestic sand dunes. From town you can use the public boat launch to explore the large expanse of Coos Bay on your own boat, or you could set out on a fishing charter and try to catch fresh fish for dinner! Around North Bend (and the neighboring city of Coos Bay) you will find plenty of fishers and hunters who will tell you this section of the state is a great place to fill your salmon and deer tags. And, with the ocean, the bay, and rivers nearby, you will have plenty of water available.

While you're visiting, you will find plenty in North Bend to keep you busy. However, if you feel like taking a trip up or down the coast, you can find even more adventures! The Southern Coast is a more sparsely-populated, relaxed part of the state than the coastline to the north. Drive south about 25 miles you will reach lovely Bandon and its cute downtown area, or you could stop in for a round of golf at Bandon Dunes, one of the top-ranked courses in the entire country. If you head north instead, a pleasantly scenic 50-minute drive will take you to wonderful Florence. Of course, you could always stick closer to your North Bend lodging and explore the North Bend/Coos Bay area. With so many restaurants, shops, and historic corners of the town, you will have plenty of ways to keep busy here. And, with the bay, ocean, forests, and the sand dunes all surrounding the city, North Bend is a great place to plan your next Southern Oregon Coast vacation!

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Newport/
Newport is one of the most popular destinations for an Oregon Coast vacation rental for a few very good reasons. This charming seaport sits on the beautiful Yaquina Bay, and is home to a world-class aquarium, a historic working waterfront, quirky museums, and some of the coast's best restaurants and breweries. There's a little something for everyone here at Newport vacation rental.

While many towns along the Oregon Coast boast jaw-dropping views, uncrowded sandy beaches, and fresh-from-the-boat seafood, Newport is special because of the diverse ways visitors can spend their time; this makes it especially well-suited to families. Kids will love exploring the Oregon Coast Aquarium, home to a large number of well-curated exhibits, including giant Pacific octopus, seals, a seabird aviary, and even the ecosystem of shipwrecks. They might also enjoy visiting Mariner Square, home of a Ripley's Believe It or Not! and a wax museum. A visit to the home of Rogue Brewing, dinner at one of Newport's upscale bistros or seafood markets, or a stroll through the galleries of the artsy Nye Beach neighborhood will suit more grown-up tastes.

For the outdoorsy types, a Newport vacation rental is surrounded by some of the region's best parks and recreation sites. South Beach State Park offers guided kayak tours along Beaver Creek; Yaquina Head Outstanding National Area is home to one of the coast's most photographed lighthouses, plus hiking trails and tide pools; and the razor clamming and surfing are superlative at Agate Beach.

Newport is just over two and a half hours from Portland, an hour and a half from Salem, and just one hour from Corvallis. A number of the region's top attractions are within an easy drive from Newport: the whale-watching capital of Depoe Bay (15 minutes), the beaches and nightlife at Lincoln City (25 minutes), and the picturesque villages of Waldport and Yachats are within an hour's drive. No trip to the Central Oregon Coast is complete without a trip to Newport!

The tiny town of Netarts, nestled along the shoreline of the Northern Oregon Coast, is practically synonymous with shellfish. The estuary of Netarts Bay seems like it's been ecologically engineered to produce some of Oregon's best oysters, clams, and crabs. The gray waters are often dotted with charter boats, crab pots dangling overboard in hopes of catching the highly-regarded Dungeness crab. On the shoreline, locals with rakes, buckets, and sometimes just their bare hands dig in the murky sand for cockles, Pacific littlenecks, and Eastern soft-shells... and yes, those are all varieties of clams. No stay at an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Netarts is complete without strapping on some waders and catching your own dinner; but that's not the only reason to visit this friendly fishing village. It's surrounded by some of the coast's most majestic scenery.

Netarts is located just north of Cape Lookout State Park, a favorite hiking and camping destination for Oregon Coast connoisseurs. The park includes the long, sandy Netarts Spit that stretches north of the cape itself, protecting the ecologically rich bay from the crashing waves of the Pacific. Beachcombers consider it a prime location for collecting glass floats and unusual shells. Cape Lookout is part of the Three Capes Scenic Route, a popular driving tour of panoramic ocean views, historic lighthouses, and rural dairy farms.

In addition to fishing, crabbing, and clamming, the surrounding area offers plenty of opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors. From your Netarts vacation rental, head to the beach to enjoy kite-flying, sandcastle-building, surfing, kayaking, and beach combing; further inland, some truly excellent hikes can be reached within a half an hour. Make sure to visit the highest waterfall in the Coast Range, at Munson Creek Falls State Park.

Of course, catching your own dinner is the best way to experience the rich bounty of Netarts Bay; but for the less adventurous, local institution The Schooner offers a more hands-off way to enjoy fresh oysters, clams, and crab. Additional dining options, such as the highly-regarded Roseanna's Cafe, are only two miles up the beach in Oceanside, or Tillamook's numerous choices are only a fifteen minute drive away.

Netarts is optimally located, with all of the region's most popular destinations easily reached within an hour and a half: Astoria, Seaside, and Cannon Beach to the north; Pacific City, Lincoln City, and Depoe Bay to the south. Portland itself is also only an hour and a half from little Netarts. To explore the best of the Northern Oregon Coast while returning home each night to a peaceful little fishing village, a Netarts vacation rental is an unexpectedly delightful option.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Neahkahnie/
Neahkahnie is a tiny beach home community nestled just north of Manzanita. The mostly residential neighborhood offers some of the Northern Oregon Coast's most beautiful stretches of beach, with the lovely cottages giving way to wilderness as Neahkahnie Mountain rises over the rugged coastline. Sunshine is more common along this sheltered stretch of shore than anywhere else along the northern coast. Although a quiet little town, an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Neahkahnie offers plenty of options for lively recreation. Nearby Oswald West State Park has a few of the region's best hikes, and surfers swear by the waves at the secluded Short Sands Beach. Stories of long-lost pirates' gold have led many treasure hunters up the Neahkahnie Mountain Summit Trail, although their only (not-too-shabby) reward is a panoramic view south to Cape Meares. Neahkahnie itself offers very little in the way of services or amenities; but the town essentially blends into Manzanita, which has a small but excellent handful of options for dining and shopping, including a few coffee shops, bookstores, and even a sports pub. Even more variety lies to the north, in both Cannon Beach (twenty-five minutes away) and Seaside (half an hour). Comparatively "big-city" shopping and chain restaurants can be found in Tillamook, about forty minutes south. Portland is less than two hours' drive away, and Seattle just under four, making a Neahkahnie vacation rental a hidden gem for those who are looking to get away from the big city for a truly peaceful destination along the Northern Oregon Coast.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Otis/
Traveling between the Willamette Valley's Wine Country and the Central Oregon Coast, you'll pass through the sleepy little town of Otis, Oregon! Just seven miles northeast of Lincoln City, Otis sits near the Coast Range, right by the Salmon River. An Oregon Coast vacation rental in Otis provides easy access to ocean beaches and all the hubbub in town, but with a quiet, inland location near fishing, hiking, and even waterfalls. Plus, because of its geography, while it's cloudy and cold on the coast, the weather in Otis can be sunny and breezy! When you feel like exploring, lace up your hiking boots and visit family and dog friendly Drift Creek Falls, about 12 miles away. From the trailhead you'll travel across a 240-foot long suspension bridge to the 65-foot falls coming off of the Siletz River. Other attractions near your Otis getaway include the Salmon River Hatchery and the Salmon River estuary - here you can observe brown pelicans, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and other types of shore birds. Of course, your favorite Otis pastime may just be relaxing on your back porch, watching the river flow by. However you spend your Otis getaway, be sure to stop by the popular Otis Cafe for a hearty, home-style breakfast like sourdough pancakes or chicken-fried steak and eggs before you head off on a hike or spend the day out exploring the river. At just under two hours from Portland, you can get away from it all in Otis at your very own cabin in the woods right near the Salmon River, the Pacific Ocean, and warm, dry summers.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Otter-Rock/
Travelers seeking a quiet, charming with a world-class location need look no further than an Otter Rock vacation home! Located between bustling Newport and vibrant Lincoln City, visitors will be within easy reach of two of the most popular destinations along the Oregon Coast.

Otter Rock is tucked on a particularly scenic stretch of the Central Oregon Coast, adjacent to Devils Punch Bowl State Natural Area. A favorite of surfers and storm watchers, the churning waters create unbelievable waves, and lively tide pools are ripe for exploring when the tide recedes. Large rock formations off the coast are perfect for exploring by kayak on calmer days!

While the town itself is small, it's certainly not lacking in charm! Settle in for a seafood lunch with outstanding views at an outpost of the popular Mo's chain, or head next door to the Flying Dutchman, one of the only working wineries along the Oregon Coast, for a laid-back afternoon of tasting and picnicking.

While a stay in an Otter Rock vacation rental is a surefire way to find peace and quiet, there are no shortage of entertainment options within half an hour's drive. Newport, just 15 minutes to the south, is home to the Oregon Coast Aquarium, Rogue Brewery, and plentiful shopping and dining along its historic bay front. There are scenic lighthouses to explore and dozens of hiking trails for all types of excursions. Just under 20 miles north is Lincoln City, with its bustling outlet mall, Chinook Winds casino, and even more restaurants and pubs to visit. For more small-town charm, Depoe Bay is even closer to Otter Rock, less than ten minutes up Highway 101. Famous for its whale-watching, Depoe Bay is also the home of the acclaimed Restaurant Beck, an award-winning temple of locally-sourced seafood and foraged cuisine.

Of course, when you're staying in one of our beautiful Oregon Coast vacation rentals, you may just decide to lounge on the deck and breathe in the salty sea air. However you choose to spend your Otter Rock vacation, it's sure to be memorable!

The small coastal town of Pacific City is the kind of place you'll want to rave about to all of your friends... but also keep secret, so it stays exactly like it is. Tucked a few miles west of Highway 101, this charming beach getaway feels a little more remote and secluded than her neighboring towns, and an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Pacific City offers visitors an unexpected take on the Northern Oregon Coast. With a location that sits along the Three Capes Scenic Drive, many who drive through town don't want to leave. Although Pacific City's Haystack Rock is somewhat less famous than its same-named (and shorter) counterpart in Cannon Beach, the impressive sea stack is still the biggest landmark in town. Coming in a close second is the Pelican Pub & Brewery, an award-winning microbrewery with jaw-dropping views of the ocean. Another popular Pacific City attraction is, of course, the beach... particularly since there are a number of sections where driving automobiles is allowed! While Pacific City is a great spot for all the usual day-at-the-beach activities (sand castle building, kite flying, beach combing, surfing, and kayaking), it also offers a few unusual options for recreation. Guests at a Pacific City vacation rental can while away their days horseback riding along the beach, seal watching at the mouth of the Nestucca River, climbing the sand dunes at Cape Kiwanda, and even hang gliding over the shoreline. When the conditions are right, crowds gather in the evenings to watch the dory fleet head home after a long day of fishing. These distinctive flat-bottomed boats don't dock at a pier with their haul of rockfish, tuna, and Dungeness crab; rather, the dorymen drive their boats right up onto the sand where their trailers are waiting. If you don't feel like making a meal back at your beach house's full kitchen, Pacific City has a few other dining & drinking establishments well worth a visit. Though the Pelican Pub is the most popular spot in town, the more upscale Delicate Palate Bistro may not have ocean views, but the seasonally-rotating menu featuring local ingredients is the rightful star here. Laid-back BJ's Burgers & Tacos offers a beachfront vibe and the best value in town. Pacific City sits just two hours from Portland, less than an hour and a half from Salem, and just under five hours from Seattle. While there's plenty to keep vacationers busy in the immediate vicinity, a Pacific City vacation rental makes a great home base to explore the rest of the Oregon Coast. To the north, popular Seaside and Cannon Beach are less than two hours away; Tillamook and its bigger-city amenities can be reached in under forty-five minutes. Heading south, bustling Lincoln City with its shopping and nightlife is just forty minutes away. In just over an hour, the Oregon Coast Aquarium waits in Newport. Pacific City offers the rare combination of being close to all the best attractions of the Oregon Coast, but secluded enough to feel like a true getaway.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Port-Orford/
Nestled along the Southern Oregon Coast, just beyond Floras Lake State Park, you can discover a peaceful and charming destination when you pick from Vacasa's Port Orford lodging options. Just under five hours from Portland, Port Orford will be the setting of a memorable Oregon Coast getaway to this unique seastack-covered shoreline.

Beach comb, fly a kite, build sandcastles - Port Orford has it all! From here, you'll be just 56 miles north of Brookings and about 27 miles south of Bandon. Day trips in either direction, along Highway 101 are a scenic and fun way to spend the day. If you do want to stay near your Port Orford lodging, right in town you can visit Battle Rock, a famous battlesite between opposing forces in 1851. At Port Orford Bay, there are opportunities for wind, board, and body surfing, and in calm weather, you can head out in a canoe or kayak. Visit the Orford Reefs, the sea lion rookery, and keep an eye out for gray whales during the migration seasons.

Throughout Port Orford, there is an extensive trail system winding through town. It's a great way to sight-see on two feet. Other hiking options include nearby  Cape Blanco State Park (also home to an historic lighthouse), the Blacklock Point Trail, Humbug Mountain, and even Buffington Park. Here you can also play miniature golf, horseshoes, basketball, or visit a butterfly and hummingbird garden. And when you work up an appetite, this small town is big on dining options, whether it's Crazy Norwegians for crab melts or the Paradise Cafe for home-style country breakfasts.

When you leave your Port Orford lodging in the morning, one thing is sure - the possibilities are many and the scenery is simply stunning! Photo credit: Mona Makela via Shutterstock

Pendleton's motto is "The Real West" and with a stay at one of our Pendleton vacation rentals, you'll get a taste of the vibrant western culture and long pioneer history that this small, friendly town in Central Oregon has to offer. Home to both the famous Pendleton Round-Up and the equally iconic Pendleton Woolen Mills (although now headquartered in Portland, the original plant in Pendleton is one of the few remaining woolen mills in operation today), Pendleton has a lot more going for it besides just cowboys and wool blankets. Not just for gambling, the Wildhorse Resort & Casino, run by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, is about eight miles from the center of downtown, and features a movie theater, live entertainment, an 18-hole golf course, and a number of restaurants, including Plateau - a fine dining experience on the top floor, boasting panoramic views of the nearby Blue Mountains. For more native culture, the casino also houses the impressive TamÃ?Æ?Ã?Â¡stslikt Cultural Institute, with exhibits and events highlighting the area's Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla Tribes. You'll have a full kitchen at your Pendleton vacation home, so be sure to check out the Pendleton Farmers' Market for fresh produce, arts, crafts, and live music on Friday afternoons, from May - October. Art lovers can also head to the Pendleton Center for the Arts for works by both emerging and well-known regional artists. Year-round, outdoor enthusiasts flock to this area for fishing, boating, hiking, and hunting. Less than an hour to the north, the Columbia River offers some of the best salmon, steelhead, and walleye fishing in the region. And closer to home on the Umatilla river, you'll find spring Chinook and trout. But, like the other Central Oregon town of Sisters, the annual rodeo is a huge draw to this community on the banks of the Umatilla River. This annual September event, started in 1910, has been a hugely-popular, yearly tradition ever since. And with a stay at a comfortable Pendleton vacation getaway, you'll have a convenient location for attending all the Pendleton Round-Up activities! At just over three hours from Portland, Pendleton is an adventurous destination. Plan a cultural trip filled with history, art exhibits, and cowboys (and cowgirls), or bring your fishing gear, hiking boots, and bike for an outdoor retreat that you won't soon forget!

The Gentleman Farmhouse on the Bluff

People are drawn to Portland for all kinds of reasons: Bicycle culture. City parks. Food carts. Farmers markets. Artisan coffee. Charming neighborhoods. Easy access to the ocean AND the mountains. And, of course, the beer. Whatever brings you to a Portland / Willamette Valley vacation rental, it's a good bet that that you'll find a dozen other things to love (and even a few reasons why you should just stay!). For lovers of nature and the great outdoors, Portland is a veritable paradise. Just west of downtown, accessible by bus, light rail, or a long walk, sits Forest Park. With over 5,000 acres full of hiking and biking trails, it is the largest natural forested area within city limits in the country. Adjacent to Forest Park is the more developed Washington Park, with the famous International Rose Test Garden, the Oregon Zoo, the Japanese Garden, and the Children's Museum. When you want to get out of the city for a day trip, the options are endless! Just half an hour east of your Portland vacation rental, the gorgeous Columbia River Gorge begins with its miles of scenic viewpoints, waterfalls, windsurfing meccas, and mountain biking trails. In just over an hour, you can be on the snow-capped peak of Mt. Hood, or in an hour and a half, sticking your toes in the Pacific Ocean along the beautiful Oregon Coast. Wine lovers will want to head south to explore the majestic Willamette Valley, where gorgeous vineyards bump up against humble hazelnut farms in this exceptionally idyllic slice of Oregon, all less than an hour from downtown Portland. After all that hiking, mountain biking, snowboarding, windsurfing, and wine tasting, you'll certainly have worked up an appetite. Luckily, Portland is home to an ever-increasing food scene with excellent restaurants, brewpubs, food carts, wine bars, and markets offering locally grown (and brewed) fare. From March to December, the Portland Farmers Market is a must-taste experience every Saturday, and you can barely walk two blocks without tripping over a new food cart carving out its own delicious niche (think specialty grilled cheeses, Surinamese noodles, gourmet pot pies, and the now-ubiquitous Korean tacos). In Portland's locavore-focused restaurants, you're more likely to see exposed brick walls and reclaimed driftwood barstools than white tablecloths, but you certainly won't have any trouble finding a five-star meal for that special night out. Imbibers should make a point to check out the Inner Eastside neighborhood, just across the Willamette River from downtown proper, where some of the city's best breweries, distilleries, and wine bars all sit within walking (or stumbling) distance of one another. Life is good in a Portland vacation rental, and getting around is easy. The public transit system makes it possible for visitors to explore the entire city without a car. Of course, if you want to really want to experience Portland like a local, rent a bicycle and explore some of the city's charming neighborhoods full of coffee houses, boutiques, bookstores, and parks. Just be warned: you really might not want to leave!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Parkdale-Mt-Hood/
When you're enjoying your Parkdale vacation rental, you can be pretty sure of one thing: when you're out and about, look over your shoulder, and somewhere you're likely to see Mt. Hood. Though the name "Parkdale" might evoke images of a humble burg somewhere on the plains, the little hamlet is host to the giant adventure and fun the mountain affords. From your Mt. Hood vacation rental visit the town's museum - the Hutson House - and you'll learn that Parkdale was born of economic necessity. In 1910, two railroad men, David Eccles and R. J. McIsaac, decided they needed a place for the Mount Hood Railroad to...well, to come to an end. Parkdale is the final stop on the scenic "Fruit Loop" around the Hood River Valley. In summer, the fruit basket won't be the only thing that's full in this part of Cascade Mountain Range. You'll find a cornucopia of activities around the town of Parkdale. Put on your hiking shoes, grab your camera and head over to Frog Creek Trail or any of the other paths in the Mount Hood National Forest. Grab your tackle box and throw a line into one of 23 fishing spots in the Hood River Ranger District alone. In winter, ski and boarding buffs can ply the slopes at nearby Mt. Hood Meadows or Copper Spur Mountain Resort. When you're hungry, Parkdale offers everything from sandwiches, to steaks, to craft brewed beer. Or, from your Parkdale vacation home, drive the 12 miles north into nearby Hood River where you'll find restaurants to suit any taste. Parkdale may be the last stop on the Scenic Byway, but it's only the beginning of a good time you can enjoy the whole year-round.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Redmond/
Welcome to Redmond, the heart - literally, the geographical center - of Oregon! From your Redmond vacation rental you'll be right poised on the eastern side of the Cascade Range at an elevation of 3,077 feet. Redmond is located in the High Desert area of the state, a fact that makes Redmond's weather almost a reverse image of Portland's, a mere 143 miles to the north. Whereas annual rainfall in Portland is 37 inches, in Redmond, it's only 8. Conversely, while Portland gets about 7 inches of snow annually, Redmond gets about 20. While Portland enjoys clear skies about 68 days a year, Redmond sees the sun a full 162 days. Translation: Whether you're a hiker, a cyclist, a skier or and angler, Redmond offers the perfect climate and hospitable residents anxious to make your visit fun and memorable any time of year. When you pass under the town's signature "Welcome to Redmond" arch, you're entering small town America, and the city has made a considerable investment in preserving that iconic image. For instance, Centennial Park (opened in 2010) is the core of the city's civic renaissance. It's a pleasant space lined with flowers, trees, tables and chairs where you can sit on the lawn and kids can frolic in the splash park. History buffs can take the Heritage Walk, a walking tour of 29 commercial and residential buildings built between 1910 and 1941. Stroll through boutiques, antique shops, and galleries where local artists offer their works. Choose from 31 restaurants and try one of the craft brews at Cascade Lakes Brewing Company. In summer, head over to the Farmers Market in Centennial Square. Redmond lays claim to one of the world's premier rock-climbing destinations: Smith Rock. With over 1400 climbing routes, Smith Rock is situated on the banks of the Crooked River in a 651-acre state park. Those prone to vertigo can opt for a hike on Misery Ridge Trail, a 3.6 mile hike that loops around the headland's tip, climbs 900 feet to a gorgeous panoramic view, then takes you gently down the backside to where you started. Cyclists will enjoy the crown jewel of Redmond's park system, the Dry Canyon Trail, a 250 acre park that also includes venues for tennis, soccer, baseball and skateboarding, and picnicking. For anglers, try and snag steelhead and rainbow trout in nearby lakes including Billy Chinook, Suttle, and Blue lakes, as well as the Ochoco, Haystack and Prineville reservoirs. Go rafting on the Deschutes River, or hiking at Tam Arthur Rim, Chimney Rock or Dillon Falls Trail. Because of its Central Oregon, High Desert climate, Redmond has some of the driest powder in the Pacific Northwest. Skiers and snowboarders can hit the slopes 35 miles southwest of Redmond at Mount Bachelor or at Hoodoo Ski Bowl, 40 minutes to the west. Snowmobilers will find trails in nearby Deschutes, Ochoco, and Willamette National Forest. The town of Bend is only 17 miles south for a fun day trip filled with brewery hopping, gallery browsing, and exploring Drake Park. And finally, in addition to the ice skating rink right in downtown Redmond, take the kids over to Operation Santa Claus two miles west of the city where you'll find a Christmas-themed working reindeer park with real reindeer! Summer or winter, enjoy the pleasant climate and great hospitality from your Redmond vacation rental, right in the heart of Oregon!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Rhododendron/
Located between Zig Zag and Government Camp, Rhododendron offers all the charm of a small town in the Cascade Mountains. And like those other communities, a Rhododendron vacation rental offers peace and tranquility, with a prime location for enjoying the great outdoors spring, summer, fall, and winter! A Mt. Hood vacation rental is a wonderful retreat at any time of year. Rhododendron isn't far from five different ski resorts in the area, making it an ideal destination for winter sports. The surrounding National Forest lands are ripe with trails for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing in winter, and hiking or mountain biking in the summer. Rhododendron is also, you might say, for the birds. Bring your binoculars, ornithologists, and watch the aviaries on two of the official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails. When you get hungry, the menu in Rhododendron is surprisingly diverse. Not only does the popular coffee roaster Mt. Hood Roasters call the village home, Rhododendron has everything from ice cream to pizza to schnitzel. Whether your passion is schussing downhill, rafting, or fishing, a stay at a Rhododendron vacation rental has something great in store for you!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Reedsport/
If you want to explore the windswept sandy beaches of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, look no further than a Reedsport vacation rental along the Southern Oregon Coast. Sitting on the beautifully scenic spot where the Umpqua River flows into the Pacific, Reedsport is an ideal destination for outdoors lovers of all kinds.

Between the Umpqua River, inland lakes, and (of course) the ocean, Reedsport is a fisherman's dream. Depending on the season, cast your line for salmon, steelhead, bass, trout, bluegill, or sturgeon. On the coast itself, clamming and crabbing are popular pastimes. The surrounding area is teeming with gorgeous hikes and wildlife watching opportunities.

Of course, Reedsport is most famous for its windswept dunes. The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area stretches for more then 40 miles, from Florence to the north to Coos Bay to the south - and Reedsport is located right in the middle. From hikes to dune buggy rides to sand boarding (think surfing, but on the sand), there are no shortage of ways to experience the singular beauty and adventure of the dunes. Another popular destination is the iconic lighthouse perched near the mouth of the Umpqua River.

Reedsport proper has a small but high-quality selection of dining options, from elk burgers and onion rings at the locally beloved Harbor Light Family Restaurant to freshly made doughnuts at the Sugar Shack Bakery. For rainy day entertainment, visit the award-winning Umpqua Discover Center, or head 30 minutes north to the handful of shops and galleries in lovely Florence, along with a supermarket for stocking up on groceries. For an Oregon Coast vacation rental to call home while you explore the wild and scenic Southern Oregon Coast, consider one of our charming Reedsport getaways in this peaceful, naturally stunning scenic area.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Rowena/
Situated halfway between Hood River and The Dalles, little Rowena, Oregon offers some of the most stunning vistas and geological features in the entire Columbia River Gorge. Travelers looking for a Gorge rental with amazing views and a secluded yet not-too-remote location may find that a Rowena vacation home is just the ticket for their next getaway! A Columbia Gorge vacation rental in Rowena will put you on the Oregon side of a magnificent geologic feature on the Columbia River - chronicled by Lewis and Clark as they passed through - known as the "Rowena Gap." Carved from the unrelenting forces of Cenozoic lava flows and Ice-Age floods, one floating down the Columbia would see The Rowena Gap as terraced mountains on both sides of the river. Six separate basalt flows can be counted in the 1,000-foot-high cliffs. At any time of year, Rowena offers an abundance of beautiful natural scenery to explore. Just to the west is Mayer State Park, set on riverfront land donated by Mark Mayer in 1910. At its base on the river's edge, the park (along with Doug's Beach on the Washington side) has become a favorite launching point for kite and sailboard enthusiasts from around the world. Meander up the Historic Columbia River Highway that runs through the park and you'll be rewarded with stunning views of the Columbia River Gorge from your perch at Rowena Crest. In the spring, the nearby Tom McCall Nature Preserve is 271 acres of land awash with colorful wild flowers of all sorts. Located in the transition zone between the heavily-forested west side of the Cascades and the drier bunch grass prairies of the east, the Preserve explodes with a rainbow of colors. While the area's hiking and scenic viewpoints could keep you (and your camera) busy for weeks, there's more to explore in the surrounding Gorge. The Deschutes River is about 25 miles east with amazing whitewater rafting, as well as steelhead and trout fishing. The bustling town of Hood River, with its dining and shopping, is less than twenty minutes to the west - or head ten miles east to The Dalles for a slower pace and a small-town feel. In the winter, skiing and snowboarding at Mt. Hood Meadows is just under 50 miles away. This unique geologic area is ripe with outdoor activities for adventuresome types, and scenic vistas for those who just want to relax with a good view. However you choose to spend your days, making a Rowena vacation rental your home away from home will leave you with unforgettable memories - and an enviable collection of photographs!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Rockaway-Beach/
In 1909, developers established Rockaway Beach, Oregon as a seaside resort in the tradition of its Long Island namesake. The small community connected by train to Portland, and served as a popular getaway for "city folk" for well over a hundred years. Today, it's a somewhat quieter but equally desirable Oregon Coast vacation rental destination for those seeking a quintessential beach town experience. With seven miles of picturesque sandy shoreline and a chain of inland lakes left behind by a long-ago channel of the Nehalem River, Rockaway Beach is one of the coast's most popular spots for outdoor enthusiasts. Boating, fishing, crabbing, sea kayaking and sand-castle building are just a few of the area's star attractions. Just south of town, photographers flock to the beautiful Twin Rocks for a jaw-dropping image of the sun sinking below the horizon. During the summer months, take a ride along the historic Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad, departing from Rockaway Beach's iconic "Little Red Caboose". With a full kitchen back at your cozy Rockaway Beach vacation home, you'll be able to catch your own dinner, be it Dungeness crab, Coho salmon, or clams. All the equipment needed can be found and rented at facilities such as the iconic Jetty Fishery. When you've had your fill of cooking, head out for oceanfront dining at the Sand Dollar for a change of pace! Rockaway Beach is less than two hours' drive from Portland, and only fifteen minutes north of Tillamook's dining, shopping, and famous Cheese Factory. A Rockaway Beach vacation rental makes an excellent home base to spend a day exploring the best of the Northern Oregon Coast; the shops & galleries of Cannon Beach, boardwalks of Seaside, and laid-back lifestyle of Manzanita are all within an hour's drive north. Head south and take in the awe-inspiring beauty of the Three Capes Scenic Drive, or just relax on the beach at Rockaway. After all, that is why people have been flocking here for over a century.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sandy/
Get to know the incredible Pacific Northwest firsthand by staying in one of our Mt. Hood vacation rentals in Sandy, Oregon! Sandy is truly an outdoor adventure base with its close proximity to the hiking, biking, kayaking, and skiing nestled around the gorgeous Mt. Hood area. With plenty of outdoor activities to choose from, the fantastic cities of Portland and Hood River both within an hour's drive, plus the cute little bars and restaurants right in town, Sandy is a great place to spend some time with friends or family.

Sandy is named after the Sandy River, originally coined the "Quicksand River" by Lewis and Clark, so there are tons of options to choose from for swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, or fishing. This area is beautiful anytime of year, but the summer brings especially great weather for hiking or mountain biking. On a clear day, make sure to head up to Jonsrud Point for a breathtaking view of Mt. Hood.

Sandy is truly the gateway to some of the state's most breathtaking scenery and outdoor adventures, with a huge variety of destinations within an easy hour's drive of our Sandy, Oregon rentals! Hop in the car for a trip up the mountain to the incredible skiing and snowboarding of Timberline, Mt. Hood Meadows, or Ski Bowl. There are also tons of beautiful hidden lakes in this part of Oregon, but both Trillium Lake and Lost Lake are can't-miss alpine escapes.

For an equally beautiful change of scenery, drive north and then east into the Columbia River Gorge to explore "Waterfall Alley", and catch a glimpse of the second-highest waterfall in the country: Multnomah Falls is also only an hour away!

Sandy is an incredible place to visit, not only because of the wonderful outdoor activities available, but also because of its history! Sandy was one of the final destinations on the Oregon Trail, and there are still old buildings from the 1800's hanging around to make you feel like you're back in the pioneer days. You can check out the Sandy Historical Museum for a brief history lesson, head to many of the nearby farms to pick your own food, or check out the Sandy Actor's Theatre for some awesome live entertainment. With the Sandy Mountain Festival, Sandy Oktoberfest, or the Hometown Holiday Festival over the year, there's plenty to celebrate! Plus, there are a few charming restaurants, coffee shops, and bars close to many of our Sandy, Oregon rentals...so you never have to feel too isolated here in the gorgeous Cascade mountains!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sandlake/
Sandlake, Oregon is a tiny, quiet community that serves as a gateway to fantastic coastal activities. When you stay at one of Vacasa's Oregon Coast vacation rentals you will be right next door to the Sand Lake Recreation Area, which has more than 1,000 acres of spectacular sand dunes, as well as a lake, beach access, and plenty of gorgeous scenery.

Though many people pass right by Sandlake without a thought on their way north to Tillamook (16 miles away), or south to Lincoln City, 30 miles down Highway 101, this community has a lot to offer visitors. Although there aren't many businesses in town, the larger Pacific City, just eight miles away, has plenty of places where you can have a nice restaurant meal or stock up on groceries.

Bring along your ATVs to explore the nearby dunes, or try out sandboarding down the slopes. There is also an estuary where you can go fishing, crabbing, and birdwatching, and the beautiful Sand Lake itself is a great place to kayak or swim. And of course, the stunning Pacific Ocean is just past the dunes, so you can also enjoy a nice long stroll on the sand while listening to the waves crash on the shore.

Come stay at one of our cozy and quiet Oregon Coast vacation rentals and be right next to all the action of the sand dunes!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Seal-Rock/
Located about 45 minutes south of Lincoln City (roughly 32 miles), the name of this community is the one consistent link to native inhabitants who perceived this rugged patch of Oregon in much the same way. Since antiquity, the long chain of partially submerged rocks stretching parallel to the shore for about 2.5 miles have indeed played host to seals and sea lions that visitors can observe today from the protected confines of Seal Rock State Recreation Site. Even before it was officially conceived in 1887, the town of Seal Rock was already significant as the final stop of the Corvallis and Yaquina Bay Wagon Road, the first road to reach the coast from the Willamette Valley. Over the decades, schemes for development hatched by waves of lumber interests from as far away as Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin failed to take root. What has endured over the years, however, is Seal Rock's reputation as a resort, a place that somehow has restorative powers even beyond its natural beauty. Needless to say a stay in an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Seal Rock will definitely leave you feeling well-rested and restored. Managed by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, the wildlife at Seal Rock State Recreation Site is "no-fee," and is not just limited to the ever-popular seals. Birds like Murres, Peregrine Falcons, Black Oystercatchers, and the rare Tufted Puffin can be seen here as well. An even greater variety of marine creatures can be seen in the tide pools. Depending on the tide level, you can observe roughly 21 different sea creatures ranching from Giant Green Anemones to Red Sea Cucumbers. Developed for day-use, the park's picnic area is in a pleasant stand of shore pine, spruce and salal. During Christmas and spring breaks, the volunteers of Whale Watching Spoken Here are on hand to help visitors spot passing grays 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. Head 2 minutes north of Seal Rock to Ona Beach State Park where you'll find a great place to launch your boat, take a kayak tour through the Beaver Creek Wetland, take a hike, or fish. Given its abundant environment and kaleidoscope of seascapes and vistas that vary in mood and color depending on the time of day, it's no surprise that Seal Rock has also nurtured a community of artists. Within just a couple miles north and south of the village are galleries where artists offer everything from hand-blown glass, wood carvings, paintings and sculptures. Whether you stay in a Seal Rock vacation rental for the wildlife, the scenery, or the serenity of the unspoiled beaches, you just might feel the same restorative power that so many have felt in this beautiful, pristine area!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Seaside/
Seaside is the Northern Oregon Coast's most popular and family-centric destination, with its bustling beach side tourist district offering plenty of entertainment and activities for visitors of all ages. Only an hour and a half from Portland, the resort town has been an oceanfront getaway for "city folk" since the mid-1800s. With an ample selection of pizza parlors, seafood shacks, antique shops, and souvenir stands, a Seaside, Oregon vacation rental is an ideal destination for those who want to enjoy the beauty of the Oregon Coast without giving up easy access to plenty of dining, shopping, and entertainment options. The beach itself is wide and sandy, with amenities such as public bathrooms and the 1.5-mile paved Promenade providing an easy stroll along the shore. The young and young at heart frolic in the surf, build sand castles, fly kites, or rent bicycles for a beachfront ride. During the warmer months, nearly every weekend brings an event or festival town. The entertainment district near the Prom (as locals call it) is full of rainy-day activities, ranging from arcade games and carnival rides to the Seaside Aquarium. For those who like to cook, Bell Buoy of Seaside offers local seafood such as clams, oysters, and Dungeness crabs, ready to take home to your beach house's kitchen. More adventuresome chefs can dig in the sand for razor clams or toss a crab trap over the 12th Avenue Bridge (just make sure to get the proper licenses at a fishing or sporting goods store first!). Dining out, of course, brings a multitude of options. A few classic Seaside dining experiences include carne asada tacos at Casa del Sol, hazelnut-crusted halibut at Maggie's on the Prom, and a giant pepperoni pie from Fultano's Pizza. We also suggest stopping by Yummy Wine Bar & Bistro for a glass of Willamette Valley's finest paired with exceptional cuisine and McKeown's Restaurant & Bar for its friendly atmosphere and fresh Northwest seafood. A Seaside vacation rental offers convenient access to all the highlights of the region. Cannon Beach's upscale shopping and dining options are only fifteen minutes south, with the beautiful hiking trails of Ecola State Park in between. Heading north, charming Gearhart offers a slower pace just five minutes away, or travel twenty minutes to historic Astoria with its bigger-city amenities. Sitting only ninety minutes to Portland and three and a half hours to Seattle, a cozy beach house in Seaside makes for a uniquely fun-filled home base to explore all the Northern Oregon Coast has to offer.

Given its proximity to Portland (12 miles south), one would be tempted to describe Tualatin (pronounced, "tu-WAHL-a-tin") as a "bedroom community," a moniker residents of this proud community would reject. Declaring war on traditional sprawl and determined to create a unique identity for itself, Tualatin began a multi-year, 300-acre redevelopment project in 1993 aimed at creating a mixed-use space, one friendly to both people and business. Today, the center of that vision has been realized in the 19 acre Tualatin Commons where visitors will find a comfortable space filled with office buildings, row houses, a hotel, work/live units called "hoffices," restaurants, and a public plaza and promenade surrounding a manmade lake. At a Portland / Willamette Valley vacation rental in Tualatin, Portland and its wealth of shopping and eateries is just 15 minutes away. Seasonal activities abound on the rugged Oregon Coast an hour and half to the west, and an hour to the east around Mt. Hood. But one needn't leave Tualatin for great shopping and dining.

Tualatin is home to a majority of Bridgeport Village, an open-air shopping area reminiscent of those found in Europe. (The smaller portion falls in the neighboring community of Tigard). It features an 18-screen movie theater, several national and regional chain restaurants, and many chain retail stores. There's even a stationary outpost of Koi Fusion, the popular Korean BBQ and Mexican food cart. Tualatin on a whole has over 50 restaurants serving every taste, from neighborhood taquerias to sushi spots to tapas and small plates at Lakeside Bistro at the Commons.

There are lots of things to do right nearby your Tualatin vacation rental. Parks, for instance, are important to the city. Serving 50 square miles, Tualatin boasts 90 parks with active recreational amenities. These include six rec centers, 162 natural areas, and eight swim centers. Skateboarders will love the new skateboard park at Tualatin Community Park. There's also a farmers market. Or, head over to the Tualatin Heritage Center and learn more about the city's history. Housed in a 1926, craftsman-style church, the building itself had its own narrow escape from the wrecking ball.

Tualatin has festivals too! If you're there in early August, its "Viva Claws Vegas," Tualatin's annual Crawfish Festival where the critter in all its culinary forms is celebrated and ingested over a two-day period with music, a parade, and contests of every sort.

So, if you're planning to be in the greater Portland area, consider a Tualatin vacation rental as your home base and avoid the traffic and hassles of the big city while still being close to Mount Hood and the beautiful Oregon coast!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Tierra-Del-Mar/
Tiny Tierra del Mar is a residential beach community nestled between Cape Lookout and Cape Kiwanda, removed from the hustle of the highway but still close to all the amenities a vacationer could need. For solitude and scenery, there are few Oregon Coast vacation rental destinations more ideal along the Northern Coast. It's been described as "old-school Oregon Coast"... no coffee shops, no saltwater taffy, just a few lucky residents and a stretch of beautifully deserted beach. While Tierra del Mar itself is quite small and offers few services, comparatively bustling Pacific City is less than ten minutes away. Sip a cold pint at the award-winning Pelican Pub & Brewery, or enjoy a more upscale meal at the Delicate Palate Bistro. Window shopping, surf rentals, and even hang-gliding lessons are all available in the charming beach town. Tillamook's larger selection of dining and shopping is only 35 minutes away, and it's a good stopping point to stock up on groceries before retreating to the solitude of the coast. For a little more excitement, Lincoln City's nightlife, outlet malls, and casino are just 45 minutes south, and the popular destinations of Cannon Beach and Seaside are about an hour and a half north. The area surrounding your Tierra Del Mar vacation rental is full of outdoor activities and can't-miss scenery. The Three Capes Scenic Drive winds through town, and makes for an excellent way to spend the day. The loop takes you through the state parks positioned at each cape, with short hikes leading to panoramic ocean views, historic lighthouses, and some of the tallest heritage trees in the state. The shoreline itself is rarely crowded, making it excellent for beach combing, flying kites, surfing, and even driving your car, which is legal along this stretch of sand. A cozy and charming Tierra del Mar vacation rental sits less than two hours from Portland, and just under ninety minutes from Salem. It's a hidden secret along the Northern Oregon Coast, and a dream come true for those seeking peace and quiet.

Tillamook is the one of the larger cities along the Northern Oregon Coast, sitting just a few miles inland on the southeast corner of Tillamook Bay. The town sits in the middle of very productive dairy country, and has become synonymous with its well-known cheese company. And though the Tillamook Cheese Factory has indeed become one of the area's biggest tourist draws, there is much more than cheddar to an Oregon Coast vacation rental in the town of Tillamook.

Nestled in the midst of the Coast Range, the area surrounding Tillamook has been designated as a state forest. Avid hikers and mountain bikers enjoy the more challenging paths, such as the Wilson River Trail, while anyone will appreciate the easily-accessible yet often overlooked beauty of Munson Creek Falls State Park. Both of these trails, as well as many others, are within half an hour of downtown Tillamook. For those who enjoy a sandier kind of trail, beautiful beaches are just fifteen minutes away from your Tillamook vacation rental in Oceanside and Netarts. Explore Tillamook's new kayaking trail with a guided tour from Kayak Tillamook. And of course, any visitor to Tillamook should spend an afternoon taking the Three Capes Scenic Drive, which offers a loop of panoramic views along the coast and a winding path through the pastoral farmland back to town.

When it comes to dining and shopping, Tillamook has more options than any town within an hour's drive. From an unexpectedly delicious roadside taco stand, to an upscale fish house, to the ubiquitous coast-town pizza place, Tillamook has a little something for everyone (including a supermarket, for stocking up on supplies for home-cooked meals in your vacation home's kitchen). Yet for these seeking a bit of solitude, the small coastal towns within a half hour of Tillamook offer plenty of laid-back charm (including Oceanside, Netarts, and Rockaway Beach, just to name a few).

Only 75 miles from Portland, a Tillamook vacation rental makes an excellent gateway to the Oregon Coast. The tourist hubs of Cannon Beach and Seaside are approximately an hour north, and the casinos and shopping at Lincoln City are an hour south. In between lies some of the most beautiful coastline in the state, ranging from wide sandy beaches to rugged cliffs and crashing waves.

And then, of course, there's the cheese.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sisters/
Only 22 miles northwest of Bend, lies the unique, Western-themed town of Sisters, a laid back, small town pick for a cozy Central Oregon vacation rental. The city's namesake is the Three Sisters - three volcanic mountain peaks in Oregon's Cascade Range and its relatively small population of a little over 2000 inhabitants belies its overabundance of events, outdoor activities, galleries, and opportunities for fun.

Once called "The Biggest Little Show in the World," the town has been the location for the annual Sisters Rodeo every second weekend of June since its start in 1914. Another big draw is the Sisters Folk Festival each year in September. After spending the day cheering on the cowboys (and girls) or celebrating American roots music, you'll want to make your way to Three Creeks Brewing Company for pints of Fivepine Porter and Flatbread Reubens or the Sisters Coffee Company for a caffeine-filled pick-me-up and a homey, log cabin atmosphere. Neither option quite your thing? With more eateries than you would expect from a town its size, don't worry, there's something for everyone's tastes.

Numerous outdoor activities take advantage of the region's lakes, mountains, rivers and natural areas for hiking, biking, skiing, and horseback riding excursions. The Sisters Tie Trail is a six mile pathway that is more of a country stroll than a strenuous workout. The trail runs parallel to Highway 20 and you'll enter the woods, emerging a bit later after an enjoyable country walk. Golfers can practice their swings at not one, but three 18-hole golf courses. Closest to Sisters, Aspen Lakes Golf Course shows off the Cascade Mountain range views and is as challenging as it is scenic.

Mountain bikers can head out to the Peterson Ridge Trail, just south of town. Part of a 25-mile multi-use trail system, riders, joggers, and dog walkers of all levels are accommodated with an easy-to-moderate difficulty level. From your cozy Sisters vacation rental, an excursion to the nearby Metolius River offers a number of activities! A tributary of the Deschutes River, this crystal clear waterway flows for about 37 miles with ample fly fishing spots for catch and release native rainbow trout, Kokonee salmon, and bull trout.

In winter, like a lot of towns in the Cascade Mountain Range, Sisters is close to skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing adventures. Hoodoo Ski Area is about 20 miles from the center of town. With a top elevation of 5,700 feet, Hoodoo offers excellent Alpine skiing, as well as Nordic trails, and for the dare devils, even snowbike lessons. At under 30 miles away, Smith Rock State Park is a prime destination for rock climbers and hikers with picturesque deep river canyons, High Desert rock formations, and wildlife viewing opportunities for golden eagles, prairie falcons, mule deer, and river otter.

From Sisters, another day trip possibility is the resort town of Sunriver, a 45 minute drive south, boasting a state-of-the-art aquatic center, multiple golf courses, and many multi-use trails. Of course, you might just opt to stay close to your Sisters vacation rental and enjoy all the charms this quaint little Western community has to offer. But, before you head home, make sure to stop by Leavitt's Western Wear and pick yourself up a cowboy hat to always remember your Sisters vacation!

The Best Little Beach House on the Oregon Coast!

The small community of South Beach, tucked away on the south side of Yaquina Bay, is only two miles from all the action in Newport's bustling bayfront, but far enough away that an Oregon Coast vacation rental in South Beach offers plenty of peace and quiet. Outdoor activities are plentiful here, with South Beach State Park boasting miles of hiking trails, sandy beaches, and kayak tours of the Beaver Creek area, as well as being a popular spot for water sports like fishing, crabbing, boating, and windsurfing. With its close proximity to Newport, you'll find spending an afternoon with sharks and puffins at the Oregon Coast Aquarium or having a couple of pints at Rogue Ales Public House, both within a five minute drive. The bayfront area also has a number of galleries, small shops, and interesting places to explore and peruse. Deciding on your next meal will be no problem here! South Beach Fish Market has both seafood to take back and prepare at home and fish and chips made to order at the market. And, another scenic trip across the Yaquina Bridge will provide even more dining choices. Visit Local Ocean for Grilled Calamari and Crab Po' Boys or Panini Bakery in historic Nye Beach for coffee drinks, pastries, and take-out pizzas later in the day to bring back and enjoying at your South Beach vacation rental. Head south about eight miles and you will end up at breathtaking Seal Rock for a morning of tide pool exploring, sketching, bird watching, or just walking along the sandy, rocky shore at the Seal Rock State Recreation Site. Closer to home, there's also the family friendly Mike Miller Park Educational Trail, a forty acre park and trail lined with Sitka Spruce, Western Hemlock, Douglas Fir, and Coastal Pine trees. Only two and a half hours from Portland, a South Beach vacation rental offers peace and relaxation, but still close to all of Newport's fun activities. In addition, South Beach is a great home base for a number of Central Oregon's top attractions. Within an hour's drive are: the casinos and beaches at Lincoln City, whale watching in Depoe Bay, and exploring the charming downtown of Florence. Of course, your favorite activity of all may just be relaxing inside your cozy South Beach vacation home with a warm, toasty fire and a good beach read!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Tygh-Valley/
The Wild West is truly wild, a landscape marked by mountains and roaring rivers...and our Tygh Valley vacation rentals offer a little slice of settler history and outdoor heaven amidst the untamed land.

Located in Wasco County, the official end of the Oregon Trail, and at the eastern base of Mount Hood, the quiet community welcomes hikers, anglers, and outdoor adventurers to its patchwork agricultural fields and river gorges. Discover the bounty and beauty worn by wagon wheels and made great by human tenacity when you visit Tygh Valley for yourself.

Settlers drank beer if they could get their hands on it, and you will too in a Tygh Valley vacation rental! Oregon's famed Rogue brewery grows everything from barley and hops to peaches and plums at its Tygh Valley farm. Stop for a farm tour from a master brewer and then hit up the tasting room for delicious suds.

The city hosts fantastic events of begotten times like the Tygh Valley Bluegrass Jamboree and The Wasco County Fair & Rodeo, or enjoy navigating narrow fairways and water hazards anytime at the Pine Hollow Golf Course. For a wider selection of dining and shopping, head just 35 minutes north to The Dalles along the Columbia Gorge.

Do as the pioneers did, explore Oregon by foot, boat, and horseback while staying in your Tygh Valley vacation rental! Book a pheasant hunting adventure with White River Outfitters, or make the adventurous hike down to the basalt falls at White River Falls State Park. WhiteWater Rafting Oregon offers canoe, kayak, and whitewater rafting trips along the rushing Deschutes River, and The Badger Creek Wilderness at Mt. Hood National Park offers 55-miles of trails traveling across fresh creeks and into alpine lakes!

Wherever you choose to explore, our Oregon vacation rentals here in Tygh Valley offer all the fun and adventure of the Wild West!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Waldport/
Waldport is the perfect Oregon Coast vacation rental destination for those who like their beaches less crowded, their streets less congested, and their pace a little slower, while still staying close to all the action of the Central Oregon Coast. This sleepy fishing village is just half an hour's drive from Newport's star attractions, but provides a much more relaxing and laid-back atmosphere to enjoy at the end of the day. Plus, the town itself is surrounded by beautiful state parks and recreation areas, offering plenty of reasons to avoid the crowds up north and enjoy the great outdoors. Fishermen will be thrilled to find that the Alsea River winds through Waldport, bringing with it some of the region's best salmon and steelhead runs. Crabbing and clamming are also excellent here, with the Alsea Bay Bridge being a popular spot to drop traps and pots during Dungeness season. Stop by the Dock of the Bay Marina to rent all the equipment needed to catch the freshest dinner on the coast. Even non-fishermen will delight in paddling around Alsea Bay and its surrounding estuaries; visit the Kayak Shack, a rental shop run by entrepreneurial students at Waldport High School. Just outside of town, be sure to spend time exploring the tide pools at Seal Rock, beach combing at Ona Beach, or Governor Patterson Memorial State Recreation Site. Or, head inland to hike through the beautiful old-growth Sitka spruces in the often-overlooked Drift Creek Wilderness Area. A Waldport vacation rental offers more in the way of peace and quiet than lively restaurants or shopping, but is close to Newport (thirty minutes north) and Yachats (twenty minutes south). Both towns offer enough high-quality seafood restaurants, family-friendly burger bars, and cozy beach-town pubs to please everyone. For rainy day activities, Newport's aquarium, historic lighthouses, museums, and art galleries provide plenty of entertainment; to explore one of the Coast's most charming downtowns and stunning views, head to Yachats and the nearby Cape Perpetua Scenic Area. Waldport is only an hour from Corvallis, two from Salem, and less than three hours from Portland. Close to the hubbub of Newport, the charm of Yachats, and surrounded by natural beauty, a vacation rental in peaceful Waldport is certainly one of the best-kept secrets on the Central Oregon Coast. Don't miss out!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Welches/
Cozy cabin the woods or an amenity-packed golf condo? An afternoon of skiing or snowboarding? Hiking or golfing first thing in the morning? A stay in one of our Welches vacation rentals will have you pondering tough decisions like those! Now an outdoor destination year-round, the town's humble beginnings took place back in 1882, when Samuel Welch and his son William started developing the land around the creek that would come to bear their names. From that first small getaway in 1893 to Oregon's first golf resort in 1928, Welches is now home to three golf courses, so be sure to bring your clubs! When you take a break from the links, grab your fishing rod. From its origin way up in Reid Glacier, the Salmon River runs right through Welches and with it come wild salmon and steelhead. (Fish populations are strained, so it's catch and release.) Check out The Fly Fishing Shop along Mt. Hood Highway to pick up gear, book an area fly fishing excursion, or just swap fishing tales with the staff. For a more hands-off approach to wildlife, hike the Cascade Streamwatch Trail where you can view wild fish in their natural habitat. A Mt. Hood vacation rental in Welches is the perfect destination if you're into cycling, pick from one of 45 bike routes around town. Hikers can choose from 31 trails of varying lengths and difficulty in the Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness Area. And, of course, there are plenty of places to climb, raft, horseback ride - whatever your outdoor activity of choice, it's here! But, no matter how you spend your time, you'll want to unwind after your adventure with some sweet potato fries, local grass-fed beef burgers, and cold beer at the Rendezvous Grill. Of course, just like the neighboring towns of Brightwood and Rhododendron, Welches does double duty in winter. There are four ski resorts nearby, as well as opportunities for cross country skiing, snowshoeing, tubing, and snowmobiling in the ample National Forest lands. Around the holidays, take a festive sleigh ride around the downtown. At the end of the day, you'll find there's nothing better than heading back to your Welches vacation rental, sitting down in front of a warm, toasty fire, and enjoying some hot cocoa!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Warrenton/
Warrenton sits just between Astoria and the Pacific Ocean, on the northernmost tip of the Northern Oregon Coast. While often lumped together with her more popular neighbor to the east and referred to as the "Astoria/Warrenton" region, the town of Warrenton itself is a bit closer to the beach and the region's important historical sites, with fewer crowds.

Natural wonders surround an Oregon Coast vacation rental in Warrenton, which sits on a peninsula crowned by Fort Stevens State Park. The fort was originally constructed during the Civil War era, and now functions solely as a military museum. One of the park's must-see sites is the beached Peter Iredale shipwreck, dating from 1906.

Just to the southwest of Warrenton, Sunset Beach offers miles of uncrowded shoreline ready for beach combing, kite flying, sandcastle building, and, of course, some beautiful sunset views. On the river side of Warrenton to the east, fishing charters and guided boat tours of the Columbia are popular ways to pass the time.

For dining and entertainment, most of the livelier options are found in nearby Astoria or Seaside, but Warrenton does offer a highly regarded sports bar/pizza pub. For those who prefer to cook a meal in their vacation home, the Warrenton Deep Sea Crab & Fish Market is a hidden gem; local fishermen consider it one of the best spots to buy fresh seafood on the Oregon Coast.

A Warrenton vacation rental makes for a great home base, with some of the Northern Oregon Coast's most popular tourist destinations reached in less than an hour. The historical sites (and breweries) of Astoria are just ten minutes away; heading south, the popular Promenade at Seaside and shopping in Cannon Beach can be reached in under half an hour; and the white sands of Long Beach, WA is only thirty minutes north. Portland is just under two hours away, and Seattleites love Warrenton's three-hour proximity for weekend getaways.

Though close to shopping, dining, historic sites, and picturesque beaches, Warrenton offers a less-crowded alternative to the numerous surrounding towns.

Beaches Fourplex: 4 Private Getaways for Up to 14!

When planning an Oregon Coast getaway, don't forget beautiful Nehalem Bay, with one of Vacasa's Northern Oregon Coast vacation rentals in Wheeler! The quiet and peaceful setting of beautiful sunsets, a marina, a couple of restaurants, and a number of popular antique stores, sleepy little Wheeler may just be the ideal destination for your next Oregon Coast retreat!

On Sundays you can start the day with a hearty brunch at local favorite, the Rising Star Cafe or visit at dinner time for specials like pumpkin risotto or North Coast cioppino. Also a great retreat for boaters, you can kayak the calm waters of Nehalem Bay from the Wheeler Marina and head down along the Nehalem bay State Park, just four miles south. And if you want to stay on land, the marina is a great place to cast your fine for a little fishing or even crabbing.

Whether you use Wheeler as a home-base for exploring nearby Manzanita or Rockaway Beach or you spend your time in town antiquing, fishing, or browsing the unique Trillium Gallery for a keepsake to bring home, one of Vacasa's Northern Oregon Coast vacation rentals in Wheeler offers a charming Oregon destination near popular attractions and ocean beaches.
#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Bluffton/
A Bluffton vacation rental isn't just a spot to call home during your trip to Lake Buchanan - this unique town is the perfect choice for armchair historians, gumshoes, and lovers of all things spooky!

After the completion of the Buchanan Dam in 1939, Bluffton townsfolk had been forced to move west of the original site, abandoning their homesteads, cornfields, pecan orchards, and ranches to be submerged beneath Lake Buchanan. However, in 2011, a severe drought drained the Old Bluffton site enough to reveal the remains of these ghost towns, reigniting interest and travel to this Texas locale!

There is plenty to explore in Bluffton if you've got an adventurous spirit...and perhaps a four-wheel-drive vehicle! Local tour guides offer those without proper wheels the chance to take the Vanishing Texas River Cruise, a "cruise" that once brought birdwatchers up the river but now docks on the Bluffton peninsula so that tourists can walk over low hills to the old town site.

The town center now sits just a few miles from the shoreline, but the deep waters of Lake Buchanan provide a beautiful spot for more traditional activities like fishing, boating, kayaking, and birdwatching.

Located near the more populated destinations of Wimberley and Lago Vista, Bluffton can provide a peaceful respite, whether for a long stay or just a day trip from your Texas Hill Country vacation rental!

For those interested in self-reflection and wellness, take a quick trip north from Bluffton to the Rainbow Hearth Sanctuary and Retreat on Lake Buchanan for bodywork and organic fare. Also north of Bluffton in the town of Tow is Fall Creek Vineyards, the perfect spot for wine lovers to sample a variety of delicious reds and whites (including the famous "Ed's Red" varietal).

#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Austin/
Not only is unique and unconventional Austin the state capital of Texas, but it's also a wonderful place for a fun-filled getaway in the Lone Star State! When you stay in one of Vacasa's Austin vacation rentals, you'll be well-located to enjoy music events like South by Southwest (SXSW), arts and culture, bike trails (like Portland, Austin is one of the most bike-friendly cities in the US), restaurants, and even stand-up paddle-boarding on downtown Austin's Lady Bird Lake. About 215 miles from both the cities of Galveston and Corpus Christi, Austin is right in the middle of the state, on the Colorado River, and on the edge of Texas Hill Country. It's also a college town and home to the University of Texas at Austin (Go Longhorns)! As Austin is consistently named one of the 10 fittest cities in the US, you can believe that there are a lot of outdoor activities! Lace up your jogging or hiking shoes and hit "The Trail" - the 10-mile Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail or take a slower pace and a leisurely stroll around the Cathedral of Junk, a multi-story structure made out of auto parts, bike parts, scrap metal, and more. The Barton Creek Greenbelt includes multiple nature trails, swimming holes, and for the more adventurous, rock climbing up the side of limestone cliffs. When you leave one of our Austin vacation rentals in the morning to head out for a day of fun, one thing is for sure - you'll have plenty of options! If the outdoors aren't your thing, take a tour of the Blanton Museum of Art on the University of Texas campus, browse the Yard Dog Gallery in the funky SoCo neighborhood, or after dinner at one of Austin's amazing eateries, hit a club for some live music. Find a perfect central Texas retreat from our growing collection of Austin vacation rentals. Year-round, this one-of-a-kind town with the motto, "Keep Austin Weird," offers outstanding music, art, outdoor activities, and restaurants that will keep you coming back for more!

#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Zig-Zag/
Looking for a  Mt. Hood vacation rental with a quieter, less populated pace? Consider charming ZigZag, located along the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway, right between similarly quiet Rhododendron and comparatively bustling Welches. Named for the nearby Zigzag River, it was a moniker most likely given for the means of crossing the water than for any crookedness along the banks. From your Zig Zag vacation rental, head along the river for a hike or just enjoy the great Oregon wilderness waiting outside your door! Like a lot of the towns in the Mt. Hood region, Zig Zag is surrounded by thousands of acres of mountainside national forest with hiking, biking, fishing, kayaking, and more! With the Zigzag, Sandy and Salmon Rivers close by, the area is a haven for anglers and fly-fishers. Pros and newbies alike can catch and release trout, salmon, and steelhead. For golfers, the Resort at the Mountain is right down the highway near Welches - and of course, this is ski country! Skibowl, Summit Meadows, and Timberline are all within a 30 minute drive. Spend the day flying down the slopes at the ski resort of your choice, and then return to your cozy Zig Zag cabin for hot cocoa in front of a roaring fire. Dining options in the area include the area's famous Skyway Bar and Grill, home of open mic nights, live music, Northwest BBQ, and "Frickles" - Southern fried dill pickle chips with aioli. For history buffs, the 1935 Zigzag Ranger Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and many of the buildings there were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) between 1933-1942. Newly opened in July 2013, a brand new Visitor's Center at the Ranger Station now provides visitors with information on shopping, dining, and recreation opportunities in Zig Zag and the Mt. Hood National Forest area. One of the unincorporated communities along the Mt. Hood Corridor, Zig Zag is an hour southeast of Portland. The drive from the city is short, scenic, and before you know it, you'll be at the edge of the Mt. Hood and at door of your charming Zig Zag vacation rental!

Vacasa's Corpus Christi vacation rentals offer a comfortable home base at this coast city on the Gulf of Mexico. Come for a long weekend to enjoy the sun and water or plan a longer stay and really get to know this vibrant and charming South Texas town. There are miles of shoreline to explore, complete with windswept beaches both on the Corpus Christi Bay and on nearby islands. North Beach and McGee Beach are both popular spots in town  or head 24 miles southeast to Mustang Island State Park and the Padre Island National Seashore.

This spot along the Gulf is just over 200 miles from both Galveston - another Gulf Coast city and Austin - home to the University of Texas. And while your vacation home has a kitchen, a Corpus Christi getaway wouldn't be complete without enjoying some of the town's famous seafood restaurants!

When you head off from your Corpus Christi vacation rental you can visit the Botanical Gardens, spend the day at the Museum of Science and History, or plan a visit to the massive Texas State Aquarium for attractions like Dolphin Bay, a brand new 400,000-gallon saltwater exhibit starring Shadow and Kai, two Atlantic bottlenose dolphins.

On the way, stop at the little town of Dripping Springs for a relaxing break before you hit the big city!

Crystal Beach may have few high-rises, but it is still a resort destination with a home-grown feel. Book tee time at the Crystal Beach Community Golf Course, or visit the Fun Spot Waterslide for a little thrill!

Of course, you'll want to try some authentic Gulf Coast cuisine, offering fresh seafood and scrumptious barbecue. Try Steve's Landing Restaurant, or Stingaree Restaurant & Bar. Grab lunch to go at the Smoking Pig food cart, or make a picnic in your own Crystal Beach lodging, then take it to the Fort Travis Seashore Park for an afternoon by the Gulf.

Our Crystal Beach rentals offer Gulf Coast travelers a different Texas experience: one of robust, natural beauty, quiet stretches of street, and miles of sand and water.
#Pathname:/usa/Texas/Galveston/
This Texas city's motto is, "It's island time," and when you stay in one of our Galveston vacation rentals, you'll be able to see why! Galveston Island is parallel to the Texas coast, deep in the heart of south Texas. You'll be about 50 miles from bustling Houston, TX and surrounded by gorgeous Galveston Bay to the north and the equally scenic Gulf of Mexico to the south. Like Corpus Christi just over 200 miles southwest, Galveston boasts beautiful beaches, a variety of cultural attractions, and fresh, delicious seafood! Visit in September for the Galveston Island Wild Texas Shrimp Festival for gumbos and other popular shrimp dishes. Year-round you can also plan a dinner out at Olympia the Grill at Pier 21 or head to Little Daddy's Gumbo Bar for a memorable seafood meal. Galveston's Grand 1894 Opera House is a sure bet for entertainment and cultural events in town, with everything from concerts, theater, ballet, to yes, even opera. Every six to eight weeks, there's an Art Walk planned in the historic downtown district, Galveston has one of the largest concentrations of Victorian architecture in the US, and the city is also home to a thriving art gallery scene. When you step outside your Galveston getaway, you'll have things to do from sunrise to sunset! Like Austin, Galveston is an outdoor enthusiast's haven! Here you'll find hiking and biking trails, birding opportunities, and even gorgeous Gulf beaches (32 miles of beaches to be precise). The seawall along the Gulf of Mexico has almost 10 and a half miles of continuous sidewalk for walkers, joggers, bikers, and sightseers. There's great boating in Galveston Bay - at Offatts Bayou, a lovely estuary, you can take a scenic cruise on a paddlewheel boat or spend an afternoon watching for loons. Of course, fishing in the Gulf is not to be missed, (you will, of course, need to purchase a Texas fishing license). Drop your line off the seawall, head out on the bay, or even get out further from the coast for offshore fishing - you might catch kingfish, snapper, and even tuna. When you're looking for comfortable and conveniently-located Galveston vacation rentals, look no further than Vacasa! Plan a Texas Gulf Coast getaway to sunny, laid-back Galveston and discover the benefits of "Island Time."

#Pathname:/usa/Utah/St-George/
Southern Utah's unique, rugged desert landscape surrounds you in these delightful Utah vacation rentals in St. George. Brimming with history and a vibrant art scene, and surrounded by some of the West's most visited national parks, our St. George vacation rentals offer a launch pad that is both bold yet homey.

Located in Southern Utah, St. George sits on the geographical convergence of three distinct land areas: the Mojave Desert of California and Arizona, the Colorado Plateau of the Four Corners region (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado), and the Great Basin of Nevada. This mosaic of landscapes creates a vacation setting unlike any other, with its red dirt, towering rock formations, and high desert vegetation.

About 140 or so miles north is the Wasatch Mountain Range of Park City, and just 83 miles north is the mountain resort of Brian Head.

One word perfectly describes St. George: active. This is a dynamic location, bringing guests close to some of the most astounding natural surroundings, yet supplying urban musts with a rich arts and culture scene.

Guests of our St. George vacation rentals will find themselves outside most of the time, enjoying the well-maintained trails and paths within many of the parks. Biking, hiking, trail riding, rock climbing, camping, and backpacking are all favorite pastimes (proper permits and passes may be required).

The crown jewel of the St. George area is about 40 miles northeast at Zion National Park. From the Narrows, a stretch of canyons and streams traversing through the park to Angel's Landing, a hike up steep cliffs to get to a panoramic view of Zion Canyon, Zion offers guests of all active levels a chance to take in its majesty.

Red Cliffs Desert Reserve is only eight miles from town proper. Boasting open spaces and fabulous views, this reserve is a paradise for unique desert wildlife like the desert tortoise and the Gila monster.

Bryce Canyon National Park, about 140 miles away from St. George, is a truly unique landscape and definitely worth the drive. Even locals struggle to adequately describe the amazingly vibrant combination of orange and pink hoodoos (tall spires of rock), and high desert scrub forests. Perfect for both hikers and photographers, this is a park you have to see to believe.

Our St. George vacation rentals are also fabulous options for athletes visiting the area for the St. George Marathon, which is the fifth-largest marathon in the US, or the IRONMAN 70.3 US Pro Series.

Need a break from the rough and tumble of the outdoors? Shop around Ancestor Square and enjoy a selection from over 100 eateries in the historic downtown area. Schedule tee times at golf courses like Sunbrook and St. George Golf Club or Coral Canyon Golf, or take the kids to the Washington City Community Center for a dip in the pool. On a hot day, stop by a local joint called Swig, a drive-thru specifically for cold drinks!

Arts and culture enthusiasts will adore the options available to them, from galleries like the DeZion Gallery exhibiting local artists to the Tuacahn Amphitheatre for Broadway shows and concerts surrounded by the astounding red rocks. Museums of all sorts dot the area, including a Children's Museum and the St. George Temple and Tabernacle. Learn about Utah's origins at the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers Museum, or about some of the Utah's oldest locals at the Dinosaur Discovery Site.

During your stay, you may catch a free concert at the Concerts in the Park series, indulge in a stroll through the annual Art Festival, or participate in an Art Walk.

Whether you're sweaty from bike riding, dusty from hiking, or have arms full of shopping bags from downtown, our St. George vacation rentals welcome you back with warm interiors, beautiful views, and anticipation for the next day of adventure.
#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/Burlington/
Northern Vermont is world-renowned for its verdant hills, quaint towns and pristine lakes—and our Burlington vacation rentals, located in the state's largest city, make the perfect home base for your next getaway.

Burlington is situated in the Lake Champlain region, and like other towns in this northernmost section of the state, boasts plenty of green spaces, historic sites, and friendly locals. The town has the luxury of also being the state's cultural capital, with myriad theaters, museums, and concert halls at which to while away the day sightseeing. An important trading center in the 1800s, Burlington remains a city with a bustling harbor amid stately Victorian homes. It's often called the "Prettiest City in America," and is a popular place to retire due to its great infrastructure and quality of life. Come explore this charming city less than an hour from the Canadian border and lay your head at one of our ?Burlington vacation rentals!

As the largest city in Vermont, Burlington boasts the most attractions, from modern cultural institutions to historic homes and lighthouses. The Ethan Allen Homestead, built in 1787, is one of the top draws in town. Guests partake in guided tours of the home of one of Vermont's founding fathers, and enjoy a midday stroll on one of the scenic trails on property. The Robert Hull Fleming Museum sits on the University of Vermont campus, and boasts contemporary and historic art for all ages. Admire the impressionist art, textiles, and lush gardens at the Shelburne Museum, or take the family history buff to the Chittenden County Historical Society & Museum.

Art lovers of all ages flock to the Burlington City Arts Center, housed in the former Ethan Allen Firehouse, for film series and art exhibits featuring local talents. The Flynn Center for the Performing Arts is housed in a well-preserved Art Deco theater, and boasts plays and other performances throughout the season. Science buffs can be found getting their geek on at ECHO Lake Aquarium & Science Center, part of the larger LEAHY Center, with interactive exhibits and more than 70 water creatures in more than 36,000 square feet.

The Burlington Breakwater Lights draw tourists due to their position standing guard over the town; the actual lighthouses are replicas of the originals, but the breakwater itself is on the National Register of Historic Places. Like other towns in the region, Burlington has a plethora of parks and recreation areas that are kept in pristine condition. Oakledge Park boasts a rocky beach but is swimmable; Red Rocks Park is a favorite in winter for snowshoeing and cross country skiing, and North Beach Campground draws leaf peepers from all over New England due to its scenic trails and gorgeous vistas.

As the gateway to the Lake Champlain region and Quebec, Burlington is a great base from which to take day trips. Several of Lake Champlain's charming towns are all within easy driving distance. North Hero and South Hero boast clean and calm beaches and abundant green spaces. Grand Isle is a town that's almost frozen in time, with quaint homesteads and a slower pace. The ski mecca of Killington is less than two hours away, and is worth a winter visit for the world-class powder alone. Montreal is only 45 miles away, and boasts even more cultural and dining sites than you'll find in Burlington...so bring your passport!

Burlington is famous as one of the country's most livable cities, and there's no better way to experience it than by living like a local in your own private Burlington vacation rental!
#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/Grand-Isle/
Like the Two Heroes nearby, Grand Isle is one of famous four - the four towns that make up the lovely Lake Champlain Islands in Vermont. With verdant land and a majestic seashore, this picturesque town lures thousands of tourists annually - and when you stay in one of our Grand Isle, VT vacation rentals, you'll understand exactly why so many visitors come back year after year.

Grand Isle's small-town vibe hasn't changed (much) since its founding in the late 1700s: you'll still find friendly locals and plenty of open spaces. Hike the Grand Isle State Park, visit the Hyde Log Cabin, or battle your friends on the golf course. However you spend your time, choosing one of our Vermont vacation rentals will ensure your stay is a grand adventure.

Nature is at its finest in Grand Isle. Yes, you won't see many historic sites or cultural institutions, but you come here to get away from the grind - and that's what Grand Isle does best. Grand Isle State Park is a must-see. Opened in 1959, the 226-acre park is a popular camping site and boasts more than 4,000 feet of shoreline. Guests can rent kayaks and rowboats from the park office or hit the sand volleyball court. Situated on historic U.S. Route 2, the Hyde Log Cabin was built in 1873 and is considered to be the oldest log cabin in the United State.

Grand Isle is known for its verdant land, and the Champlain Islands Farmers Market boasts herbs, fruit, pastries, wooden bowls, and even jewelry. If visiting a farm is on your itinerary, head to Pomykala Vegetable Farm. The Pomykala family has been at it since 1977, and their 70-acre estate boasts organic greens and strawberries during the season.
#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/Isle-La-Motte/
Floating calmly amongst the waters of the vast and regal Lake Champlain, the shores of Isle La Motte, the northernmost link in the chain of the Lake Champlain Islands, offers a peaceful respite for nature-lovers and those looking to trade TV screens and cell phones for sunrises and scenic views. Though remote, Isle La Motte hosts an extensive and easily accessibly shoreline - a kayaker's dream - and endless black marble nooks and crannies begging to be explored. A trip to Isle La Motte and a stay in one of our Isle La Motte vacation rentals epitomizes the meaning of a peaceful getaway.

The real treasure of Isle La Motte lies in its foundation, which is made of an alluring dark limestone called black marble. The Fisk Quarry Nature Preserve offers visitors a glimpse of the island's history as a mining town. Though much of the quarry is overgrown and bursting with lush flora and fauna, one need not be a geologist to appreciate the natural beauty of the mighty marble facades, which are speckled with exposed fossils. Amateur archaeologists and curious hikers welcome.

The Goodsell Ridge Preserve contains 480 millions years of fossilized history from the Chazy Fossil Reef amongst its 85 sprawling acres of old farm fields. Venture on a self guided tour of the fossils for a fascinating recap on evolution that would make your fifth grade science teacher proud, or traverse through the flora of the trails for your daily dose of natural wonder.

Kayakers, bikers, and hikers will find no shortage of outdoor adventure with their preferred mode of active transport. Reinvigorate a tired body or an overworked mind with a brisk paddle along the coast, bike around the perimeter, or hike through the quarry and find your sanctuary in the lake breeze and lush trails of this island destination.

A trek, bike, or drive to the northern point of the island will allow visitors a glimpse of the charming Isle La Motte Light, an iron lighthouse first used in 1857, and which still functions today on solar power. Tranquility awaits in the spiritual atmosphere at St. Anne's Shrine, where peaceful self reflection meets zen bending on the shores of Sandy Point.

An island retreat at our Isle La Motte vacation rentals offers an array of opportunities to unwind in seclusion as well as chances to venture outside of the black marble bluffs. Because the Lake Champlain Islands are nestled between Montreal and Burlington, both destinations are accessible from Isle La Motte, which is about sixty miles south of the former and forty-five miles north of the latter. It is also about 18 miles from Grand Isle, one of its sister islands, where visitors will find Grand Isle State Park for further opportunities to soak in the majesty of the great New England outdoors.

Golden under crisp foliage in the fall and buzzing with outdoor activity in the summer, Isle La Motte beckons visitors with humbling natural beauty along the shores of the stunning Lake Champlain. A trip to the island and a stay in one of our Isle La Motte vacation rentals is perfect for those looking to unwind and replenish with a little lake effect serenity. Book your bliss today!

#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/South-Hero/
One of four towns on the Lake Champlain Islands, South Hero, Vermont, earns a unique place among them. Lush forests give way to mountain streams and rocky shores, evoking a more peaceful time. The beach is a lovely place to enjoy a quiet summer's day and myriad hiking and biking trails abound. You'll probably not see another soul on your daily excursions—it's no wonder our South Hero, VT vacation rentals are a hit with visitors!

Founded by hundreds of Revolutionary War veterans to honor Ethan and Ira Allen, South Hero was originally part of the single town of Two Heroes, but was reconfigured in 1798. The town has long sustained an all-American feel, with quaint mom-and-pop shops, a school that is also its community center, and miles of verdant, organic farmland. Apples are the main crop, and you'll find orchards throughout the town's charming environs. With only three bridges connecting the four Lake Champlain Island towns to the rest of the state, visitors experience a true getting-away-from-it-all vibe. Choosing the comfort and privacy of our Vermont vacation rentals in South Hero will definitely boost that feeling!

South Hero has a small year-round population, and visitors head here to truly escape, so the town doesn't boast dozens of historic sites like other Vermont cities. Still, there's plenty to see. Nothing beats White's Beach on a hot summer day. Situated on West Shore Road, the beach features a volleyball court as well as a swimming section, but non-swimmers will love the views of the Adirondacks and the southern portion of Lake Champlain. Bird House Forest is just moments away from Whites Beach, boasting a plethora of brilliantly colored birdhouses hanging from hardwood trees. (It's a swampy area, so make sure to wear your wellies when you venture forth!)

Nearby Castle Island is on everyone's must-see list, due to the miniature castles built by Harry Barber in the early 20th century dotting the landscape.

#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/West-Dover/
The best things to do in the scenic state of Vermont require a mountain and plenty of powder, and one in search of these conditions need not look further than our West Dover vacation rentals!

Home of the beautiful Mount Snow, each year, winter sports enthusiasts flock to West Dover to enjoy what is arguably the Northeast's most entertaining and abundant natural resource - snow! Whether you're a snow bunny or a seasoned shredder yourself, or are just looking to enjoy the charm of smalltown New England from a cozy home away from home, a stay in one of our ?Vermont vacation rentals is sure to satisfy.

As previously mentioned, West Dover's greatest attraction is Mount Snow?. With a summit elevation of 3,600 feet, 588 total skiable acres, and four main mountain areas, including 100 acres of ten terrain parks (for those looking to add to their repertoire of tricks on the super-pipe), it's easy to spend countless hours shredding the snowy slopes. The mountain is also host to a series of winter sports events and competitions, making it a mecca for aspiring pros - and casual boarders looking to learn from the best.

If you're having trouble finding balance on a board, or are simply along for the ride, perhaps a massage, facial, or herbal wrap at Mount Snow's holistic ?Naturespa? will provide the rejuvenation you need to nail tomorrow's first run. The spa offers seasonal specialties,so sore muscles, tense shoulders, or tired minds can find relief at the hands of experienced masseuses any time of the year. Even if you don't have time to hit the spa, a no-stress stay in one of our ?West Dover vacation rentals will ensure comfort and relaxation so you can focus on enjoying your New England getaway.

The fun at Mount Snow isn't limited to the winter months. The summer season is just as jam-packed with alpine activities as its chilly counterpart. When snow-covered trails shed their wooly white blankets, mountain bikers hit the lifts to explore the slopes on wheels in the ?Mount Snow Bike Park?. Those looking for a little adventure can let gravity take the wheel (literally) and try a few runs on Trail 7, dubbed the largest introductory trail in the East.

Adrenaline junkies and leisure lovers unite on the links at the ?Mount Snow Golf Club?, but that isn't to say a round or two on this course won't get your heart pumping. Nestled in the Green Mountains and boasting radiant emerald fairways, a round in the mountains poses a unique challenge to both casual and serious golfers.

If you're looking to get off of the mountain for a bit, Wilmington, VT. is only about eight miles from West Dover and offers family fun at the Zora Adventure Center and aquatic adventures with High Country Marine on Lake Whitingham. Approximately 70 miles northeast await the snow-capped peaks and trails of Killington. West Dover and Mount Snow are known for being exceptionally accessible, and are only about 150 miles from ?Boston and 100 miles from Hartford.

When the flakes fly this winter, you'll want to be one of two places - flying down the slopes of Mount Snow or cozy and comfortable in one of our accommodating ?West Dover vacation homes?!
#Pathname:/usa/Vermont/Woodstock/
Picture the ideal New England landscape. There are rolling hills, cloaked in the golds and ruby reds of changing foliage or blanketed with thick coats of undisturbed snow, and dotted with the occasional idyllic red farmhouse - the stuff of an N.C. Wyeth painting. Nestled in a sleepy valley, the downtown area is quaint and placid, characterized by red brick buildings and patches of cobblestone in the streets where people mill about (with a purpose, of course - this is New England after all!). Here, the street lamps glow warmer and brighter, the air feels crisper, and the night sky, unpolluted by artificial light, boasts more celestial freckles than seemingly possible. Luckily, the rustic charm and holiday-card imagery of this scene is no fantasy and the lovely reality of Woodstock, Vermont is even better than what you imagined! Book one of our cozy Woodstock vacation rentals today to see for yourself why everyone is talking about beautiful New England.

New England prides itself on its maple syrup and a visit to Woodstock certainly warrants a taste of the stuff right from the source! Tour the sugar house at Sugarbush Farm in the fall and see how maple syrup is made while savoring samples of nature's nectar. Work up an appetite and meet the farmers and animals as you walk around the grounds. Tease your tastebuds by transitioning from sweet to savory when you try one (or two or ten!) of the fourteen varieties of homemade cheeses. The farm, a microcosm of the tastes and sights of classic New England, scintillates in golds and red in the fiery glory of autumn and is irresistible for leaf peepers and amateur photographers alike!

A visit to the Billings Farm and Museum is essential to a well-rounded Woodstock experience. Take a trip in time through traditional Vermont culture and history, tour the working dairy farm, marvel at the changes in farm technology, and develop an appreciation for the way family farms operated in the late 1800's! The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Park charms visitors with its emerald beauty, ancient hemlocks, and placid pastures of the Green Mountains. Guests of all ages will be captivated by the intriguing anecdotes, movies, and facts about the Marsh, Billings, and Rockefeller families and their respective historical roles in the area. Round out your Green Mountain history lesson with a visit to the Woodstock History Center or attend one of their sponsored classes or events, ranging from old-timey musical acts to stonewall building classes to ice cream socials. Spend an afternoon experiencing the essence of Woodstock with a perusal through its quaint downtown area.

When it comes to winter weather, New England does it best and Woodstock certainly makes snow days fun! The well-maintained, family friendly trails of Woodstock's Suicide Six resort hosted the first National "Snow Surfing" (more commonly known today as snowboarding) competition in 1982 and has been providing downhill thrills to skiers and snowboarders of all ages and abilities ever since! The mountain boasts 24 trails (30% of which are rated as beginner, 40% as intermediate, and 30% as advanced), cozy outdoor fireplaces, and an inviting lodge for ski groupies to hang with snow bunny friends between runs. It's a great place to share your passion for skiing and snowboarding with your kids and friends before retiring for hot chocolate by the fire for a quintessential New England winter evening in one of our Woodstock vacation homes!

With its authentic red wooden bridges and picturesque views, the Ottauquechee River is wondrous and pristine in the ice and snow of winter and lush and glittering in the spring and summer. A stroll along the riverbank and across the rustic bridges will evoke pastoral reverberations of that Robert Frost poem you memorized for seventh grade English. Kayak the placid waters or appreciate the natural beauty through the lens of your camera and let the panacean effects of the pure New England air melt away your worries and woes!

If you're in the market for breathtaking views at a higher elevation, plan a sunrise hike up Mt. Tom for a bird's eye perspective of Woodstock.

Woodstock is only about 19 miles from even more skiing and fantastic powder action in Killington and 77 miles from the slopes of Mount Snow in West Dover. Eclectic boutiques and exquisite dining await in the groovy town of Burlington, about 90 miles northwest on the majestic Lake Champlain.

Perhaps you've been longing to escape to the clean mountain air on snowy ski slopes or maybe you've been pining for the incomparably picturesque beauty of a quintessential New England landscape ablaze in the captivating colors of the fall foliage. Whatever it is that you're looking for, you'll find exactly what you need during your stay in a beautiful New England vacation rental.

When two roads converge in a yellow wood, take the one that leads you to cozy comfort with traditional, small-town Vermont flair in one of our lovely Woodstock vacation rentals - even if its not necessarily the one less traveled, we're sure Robert Frost wouldn't mind!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Anacortes/
Pronounced "Anna-Cortis," Anacortes, Washington is named for Anna Curtis, the wife of early Fidalgo Island settler, Amos Bowman. Poised half-way between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. - with Fidalgo Bay to the east and the waters of Puget Sound to the west - Anacortes is perfectly placed for its role as homeport to the four islands of the San Juan Archipelago: Lopez, Shaw, Orcas, and San Juan. Unlike the islands it serves, Fidalgo Island is anchored to the Washington mainland and can be reached by car. Travelers not accessing the islands by air via the Orcas Island or Lopez Island airports will board the Washington State Ferry at Anacortes and make their way to the islands by ship, a not so regrettable fate once one is afloat and experiencing, up close, the awesome beauty of Puget Sound. In its long history, Anacortes has evolved from a home for native Indians, to early Spanish explorers, trading and trapping, farming, fishing, and lumber to its present role as a tourist hub and gateway to the magnificent San Juan Islands. Like footprints, the tangible evidence of that evolution can be seen in the many historic buildings that make up Anacortes' "Old Town." Visitors can stroll among a variety of antique shops and galleries where everything from paintings, sculpture, jewelry, glass-work, photography and mixed media can be found. There's also the Anacortes Museum and Maritime Heritage Center where you'll find vintage photos and art work in its Carnegie Gallery. When you're hungry, sample one of 50 eateries in Anacortes serving everything from deli-sandwiches to Mediterranean and Mexican fare. If you're in the city in August, check out the Anacortes Arts Festival. In October, there's "Bier on the Pier," Anacortes' version of Oktoberfest. Though most of Anacortes hugs the waters of Puget Sound in the north and wraps eastward along Fidalgo Bay, much of Fidalgo Island is undeveloped. Certainly, there's no lack of things to do out on or near the water. You can take a whale-watching tour, go kayaking, sailing, boating, and crabbing. But south of bustling Anacortes are vast stretches of green with parks and lakes where bikers and birders, hikers and wildlife watchers, can see everything from eagles, to deer, otters to raccoons, and beaver to coyote. Climb Mount Erie and get an eagle's-eye view of the surrounding area. Whether charming and picturesque Anacortes is, for you, just a jumping off point to the San Juans, or a destination in-itself, take a little time to savor the history and beauty of this little city nestled by the waters of Puget Sound.

Just across from the Long Beach Peninsula, a Bay Center vacation rental offers a small-town environment with gorgeous Willapa Bay views! And for seafood lovers, the bay is home to many oyster farms because of the shallow estuary environment, just perfect for this type of marine life. Not just for oysters and clams, the Willapa Bay is a scenic and peaceful Washington destination for getaways right near ocean beaches and the towns of Seaview and Long Beach, just across the bay and to the southwest. Sightsee along the waterfront, buy Dungeness crab, salmon, and Pacific oysters at local canneries, boat along the bay and beautiful water trails, or just relax at your lovely Bay Center vacation rental. The Willapa National Wildlife Refuge is just 20 miles south for a day-trip to view wildlife (including harbor seals, bats, porcupines, river otters, pelicans, and owls) and hike along scenic trails. Visit the Long Beach Peninsula and Willapa Bay with a stay at one of Vacasa's Bay Center vacation rentals. Close to ocean beaches, fresh seafood, and gorgeous scenery, you'll be inspired to relax and unwind along this very special section of the Washington Coast.
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/camano-island/
It's "the island you can drive to!" Camano Island hangs off the edge of the Washington mainland 55 miles north of Seattle like a giant, green parenthesis. Unlike the more developed San Juan Islands to the north, you won't have to wait for a ferry here. Yet, despite Camano Island's accessibility, it's generally unspoiled. Surrounded by Saratoga Passage to the west, Skagit Bay to the north, and Port Susan to the east, the island is naturally isolated and is protected even further by two State Parks within its boundaries. Little wonder, then, that loyal visitors to Camano Island swell the population each summer to enjoy a pristine island environment free of glitzy tourist traps. Carpeted with majestic evergreen forests and rimmed by 56 miles of pristine beaches, Camano Island is 39.7 square miles of unadulterated Pacific Northwest beauty and abundance. Your first stop, as you enter Camano Island, should be the Camano Gateway: the center where you'll find lots of useful info about parks, recreational activities, and local businesses. Boaters will find launch sites at Utsalady Bay and Cavalero Beach. Head over to Cama Beach State Park where you'll find a restored 1930's fishing resort. And speaking of fishing, Camano Island is unparalleled! Camano Island has fishing available during every season: from salmon in the winter, spring & summer; to lingcod, Dolly Varden trout & cutthroat in May/June; to year-round flounder and bottomfish. Iverson Beach is one of the few places in Washington State where you can fish for sturgeon year-round from shore! (Hikers: There's also a great trail that winds through the preserve). Or, check out Camano Island State Park, whose 134 acres is filled with mountain vistas and miles of beach perfect for shellfish harvesting. The east side of Camano offers stellar views of Mt. Baker, Mt. Rainier, the Cascade Mountains and quiet Port Susan. Camano Island isn't all wilderness, however. There are a few restaurants, grocery stores, galleries and shops. And there are events, among which are the Port Susan Snow Goose & Birding Festival (February), The Spring Art Show (June), Art by the Bay and The Stanwood-Camano Festival of Art and Music (July), The Harvest Jubilee (September), and The Stanwood-Camano Chili & Chowder Cook-off (November). No matter when you come to Camano Island, you'll discover an environment filled with astounding beauty, one refreshingly unscathed by human hands.

Fun for the whole family is always right around the corner in a Chelan vacation rental! See the region from a whole new vantage point with a helicopter or sea plane tour.

Home to unique glacially carved soil, the region is most famous for pinot noir and riesling, as well as syrah and Gewurztraminer. Wineries dot the countryside between Chelan and its neighboring town of ?Manson, and visitors could spend a whole week exploring the area's offerings.

A lovely Bavarian style permeates the entire village, so a stay in one of our Leavenworth lodging options promises easy access to the unique businesses of this town while still being within easy reach of all the fantastic attractions near our other Washington vacation rentals.

Here in Central Washington you will enjoy gorgeous scenery in every direction, ranging from snow-capped mountain peaks to raging rivers to green valleys and more! To get to your Leavenworth lodging from Seattle simply take a scenic two-hour drive east. Along the way you will drive over Stevens Pass, breathe in pine-scented fresh mountain air, and hear the sounds of the Wenatchee River rapids flowing downhill. If you're coming into Leavenworth from Spokane or other cities to the east, you will drive by hills, valleys, and fruit orchards on your way into town. In fact, this area is a fantastic place for agritourism, and nearby Wenatchee, just 30 minutes down the road, is famous for its apple, cherry, and pear orchards. Nature's bounty is on full display in this part of the state, and when you stay in one of our Leavenworth cabins you will be close to all the farms, breweries, and wineries - as well as all the other cities and attractions - in this wonderful area.

In Leavenworth itself, you will find an endearing and lovely city. Visitors immediately notice that all the buildings (even certain well-known fast food restaurants and grocery stores) are fully decked out in Bavarian-style architecture. Speakers broadcast faint polka music near the main street, and many of the businesses have fun German themes. Souvenir shops sell everything from authentic nutcrackers to music boxes and other gifts, and there are ample fantastic restaurants. Spend an afternoon sampling the bratwurst, pretzels, and fondue, washed down with a refreshing pint. Of course, if you're in the mood for something a little different, you can easily order pizza, burgers, or even crepes, then try some wine tastings from local wineries.

This is truly a special town that will keep you coming back for more!

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Long-Beach/
The Long Beach Peninsula stretches for 28 miles, with beautiful sandy shores on the Pacific side and the wildlife-rich Willapa Bay on the other. At the base of the peninsula sits the charming town of Long Beach, Washington State's most popular beach town and a favorite getaway of Seattleites and Portlanders alike. With a boardwalk, a walkable downtown, and naturally stunning surroundings, a stay in a Long Beach, Washington vacation rental makes for an idyllic Pacific Northwest coastal experience.

Within thirty minutes of town sit a number of splendid state parks, recreation areas, and a national wildlife refuge. Among them is Cape Disappointment State Park, one of Washington's most popular destinations and home to the Northwest's oldest lighthouse, jaw-dropping views of the mouth of the Columbia River, and some truly excellent fishing. To the north, Leadbetter Point State Park has some of the region's best birdwatching along the northern shore of Willapa Bay, plus several miles of hiking trails and opportunities for crabbing and fishing.

Although a small town, visitors can eat very well in Long Beach. The Aloha Charlie Fish Company offers perhaps the best clam chowder and pan-fried oysters in town, but they have plenty of healthy competition! A few minutes outside of downtown Long Beach, The Depot in Seaview and Pelicano Restaurant in Iwalco offer more upscale dining. For rainy-day entertainment, it's hard to beat the iconically kitschy Marsh's Free Museum (home of Jake the Alligator Man), but the Long Beach Peninsula is also home to a kite museum and a cranberry museum, dedicated to the region's productive cranberry bogs.

Long Beach is just over three hours from Seattle and two from Portland, making it a convenient destination from either city. Although technically in Washington, it's easy to explore the best of the Northern Oregon Coast from Long Beach; historic Astoria is only half an hour away, and popular tourist destinations at Seaside and Cannon Beach can be reached within an hour. For a Pacific Northwest beach town equally rich in natural beauty, outdoor recreation, and dining & entertainment options, Long Beach can't be beat.
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Klickitat/
With sunshine most of the year and natural beauty for miles, the town of Klickitat, Washington, may be small, but it's a big draw for fishermen, hikers, rafters, paddlers, and all kinds of outdoor adventurers and nature enthusiasts. Staying in one of our Klickitat vacation rentals is a great way to experience the beautiful, glacier-fed Klickitat River, a nationally designated Wild and Scenic place, and the surrounding canyons and hill country. Vacation rentals are a particularly convenient option for fly fisherman and steelhead seekers looking for Klickitat lodging during the peak river seasons.

If steelheading, fly fishing or float fishing is your thing, Klickitat is the place for you. It's one of the top fishing destinations in the Columbia River Gorge. At the end of a fun day on the river, return to your Klickitat vacation rental and grill up your fresh trout, salmon or steelhead for dinner.

The Klickitat River, which ends at the Columbia River Gorge at Lyle, just east of White Salmon, is a popular destination for rafting, kayaking and canoeing. Hikers and mountain bikers love the Klickitat Trail, a 31-mile path that meanders along the Klickitat River, following an old railroad bed through wild, scenic territory dotted with wildflowers in season, and the nearby reaches of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, including the foothills of Mt. Adams, which looms regally over the Klickitat River Valley. Klickitat is also a popular destination for birding: an abandoned dry ice factory outside of town is an annual roosting place for hundreds of Vaux's swifts, which put on a stunning air show when they return to the chimney each night.

The tiny, scenic canyon town of Klickitat celebrates its heritage each June at the annual Klickitat Canyon Days festival, when the whole community comes out to toast its 100-plus years of history. Year-round, shops like the Canyon Market, and Klickitat Trader, serve as community gathering places... and a convenient place to pick up fishing supplies, sandwiches, groceries, passes and permits, or to leave your truck and trailer for the fishing shuttle service, which means you can fish your way down the river and have your vehicle waiting for you where you pull out! With so much natural beauty and all types of river adventures, Klickitat is a winning destination for Columbia Gorge vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Lopez-Island/
Lopez Island lies about 80 miles north of Seattle and is the first stop in the 45 minute ferry ride beginning in Anacortes, Washington on the U.S. mainland. Lopez Island is a great pick for an off the beaten path San Juans / Puget Sound vacation rental, as you will find there's always something to do in this unique part of the globe - even if it's just relaxing on the back porch of your beach house! The island is 15 miles long, eight miles wide, and is mostly rolling hills and flat pastureland, surrounded by sparkling blue waters. It's the third largest island in the San Juan Islands chain. If you're lucky enough to arrive in your own boat, you'll have your choice of marinas in Fisherman Bay, at Spencer Spit State Park, and Odlin County Park. An outdoor enthusiast? You'll be right at home here! For cyclists, Lopez Island is a dream-come-true! The truly ambitious can take the 30-mile loop around the island that will take you, among other places, through Spencer Spit Park, Odlin Park, and MacKaye Harbor. Hikers will relish the 45 acres of day trails in Shark Reef Sanctuary, with trails through old growth woods and along scenic coastal vistas. Along the way, don't be surprised if you see deer, foxes, eagles, harbor seals, river otters, and endangered orca whales! There are lots of public beaches and trails that lead to the waterfront. Much of Lopez Island's natural beauty is protected in parks like Agate Beach, Shark Reef Park, and Upright Head. The commercial and cultural center of the island is Lopez Village where you'll find shops, restaurants, cafes, and galleries along the bay. Have lunch at the picnic area near Lopez Village Park. Choose from six eateries on the island. There are weekend farmers' markets and artisan events. Two events stand out in the island's calendar: In April thereÃ¢â?¬â?¢s the bike tour around the island, and beginning after Thanksgiving, the Winter Village is a holiday celebration including an array of lights and decorations. Like its neighbor Orcas Island to the north, Lopez Island is sandwiched between Vancouver, B.C. to the west, Washington State to the east, the Strait of Georgia to the north, and the Strait of San Juan de Fuca to the south. And although the journey here will include a plane ride or a trip on a Washington State Ferry, once you arrive at your relaxing Lopez Island vacation rental, you will be rewarded greatly for your extra effort!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Lyle/
A getaway to one of our beautiful Lyle, Washington vacation rentals may bring an unexpected perk: this historic town's unique location on the north side of the Columbia River Gorge brings with it over 300 days of sunshine a year! Lyle sits further east than other Washington-side destinations like Washougal and Stevenson, which means you'll experience a little of the high-desert climate along with fewer crowds and tourists that tend to stick closer to Portland (which is still only 75 miles away). Perched above the confluence of the Columbia and Klickitat Rivers, Lyle draws fishermen from across the Northwest with its outstanding salmon and steelhead runs each year. Outdoors lovers also flock to the Klickitat's excellent kayak runs and the hiking trails in the area, many of which boast jaw-dropping views of the surrounding mountain peaks. For those who would rather explore the Gorge in a more luxurious fashion, the countryside surrounding Lyle is dotted with wineries, farmer's markets, and beautiful restaurants. There are over a dozen wine tasting rooms within minutes of downtown, including the highly respected Syncline Wine Cellars and the small yet lovely COR Cellars. Lyle is scenic and offers plenty of small-town charm, but if you'd like a few more options for dining and shopping, bustling Hood River is less than a 25-minute drive away across the Columbia River. If you're looking for winter recreation as well, just head to Hood River and then up Highway 35 Ã¢â?¬â?? Parkdale is only 28 miles away, skiing at Mt. Hood Meadows about 45 miles up the mountain, and even Government Camp is just over an hour away. Springtime wildflowers, summer hikes, and year-round wine tasting mean that beautiful little Lyle has something special to offer no matter what time of year! When you're seeking a Columbia River Gorge vacation rental, you'll find this under-appreciated historic town makes a wonderful home base for all your adventures.

From your Orcas Island beach rental there are numerous outdoor activities to consider. Will it be an afternoon of golfing at the Orcas Island Golf Course? Maybe a morning spent biking the rolling island hills or a lazy Saturday spent on the water, taking part in one of the many whale watching expeditions based right on the island. Expansive Moran State Park on the east side of the island, has almost 40 miles of trails to explore over 5,000 acres of forest. Right on Cascade Lake, it is also a popular destination for swimming, boating, fishing, and picnicking - you'll never run out of things to do here.

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Seattle/
Vacasa's Seattle vacation rentals offer a front-row seat to the Northwest's largest city. From the iconic Pike Pace Market and the Space Needle to boating on Lake Washington to bar hopping on Capitol Hill, a stay in one of our Puget Sound vacation rentals in the Emerald City - whether for business or leisure - is sure to deliver unforgettable memories with a stunning natural backdrop!

When you visualize Seattle, you probably think about riding the monorail, rainy days, and sipping good, strong coffee - Seattle certainly has all of those things, but there's also the EMP Museum and the Chihuly Garden at the Seattle Center, the waterfront Ferris wheel, or even people-watching in Pioneer Square. View the exhibits at the Seattle Art Museum and the Asian Art Museum, or spend an afternoon strolling through unique shops, galleries, and yes, watching the fish mongers throw seafood around at Pike Place Market! And when you work up an appetite, Seattle has hundreds of dining options. From the Dahlia Lounge right downtown (be sure to end your meal with the made-to-order doughnuts) to a neighborhood snack spot like Hot Cakes Molten Chocolate Cakery in Ballard. Of course, since you'll have a kitchen back at your Seattle getaway, you could always pick up some salmon before heading back and preparing a feast later at your well-stocked Vacasa vacation rental.

While downtown is certainly filled with its share of attractions, Seattle's neighborhoods are packed with their own charms and points of interest. Just northwest of all the hustle and bustle, Queen Anne is up high on a hill and offers amazing, panoramic views of Seattle, while still only a 20 minute walk from attractions like the Space Needle. Belltown sits between Lower Queen Anne to the north and downtown to the south, and is full of shops, restaurants, and home to Sub Pop Records world headquarters. To the north and northeast are the neighborhoods of South Lake Union and Capital Hill - both offering a different view of Seattle, from serene lake views and green spaces to late-hour entertainment and nightlife. Seattle is often called a "city of neighborhoods," and with a visit to this eclectic destination, you'll see why!

In the northwest corner of Washington, Seattle is well-located for a number of day trips. Hop on a Washington State Ferry to the Olympic Peninsula to wander around the Victorian-style town of Pt. Townsend, take a whale watching excursion in Puget Sound, or visit nearby Whidbey Island. The gorgeous San Juan Islands are a bit further away, but an easy plane ride from Seattle - you can head out on the morning, wander around Eastsound or Orcas Island, and be back in your cozy Seattle vacation rental's comfortable bed at night. When it comes to outdoor activities, all of the Pacific Northwest has an abundance of choices and Seattle is no exception. Aside from urban hikes, just a 30-minute drive will put you at a number of gorgeous trails including the Cedar River Trail, Evans Creek Preserve, and Souring Eagle Regional Park. Like it's neighbor Portland to the south, Seattle is one of the most bike-friendly cities on the West Coast. And if you like fishing, you can sign up for a Puget Sound fishing charter and maybe even catch your own dinner! One thing is sure, with a stay in one of our Seattle vacation rentals, you'll discover all that this amazing city has to offer!
#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Seaview/

#Pathname:/usa/Washington/Stanwood/
Located an hour north of Seattle, Stanwood is a commercial center for nearby Camano Island to the west, and the residents of the river valley east of Interstate 5 and north of the Tulalip Indian Reservation. Though its proximity to Camano Island and Puget Sound establishes it geographically as a gateway to the recreational activities and natural abundance of the Sound and the San Juan Archipelago, for much of its history, Stanwood's economic fortunes were tied to the Stillaquamish River (named for one of the early, indigenous tribes) just west of town. Until the railroad and modern highway system, agricultural products and wood from the lumber mills were floated to market on steamboats that plied the river's waters. Though Stanwood's name is derived from the maiden name of the wife of one of the town's founders - D.O. Pearson in 1877 - one is more apt to today to find evidence of the town's predominantly Scandinavian influence. Names like "Viking Village" and "Off Da" are evidence of the influx of Nordic families in the late 1800s. Stanwood is surrounded by farms, shorelines teeming with wildlife, and breathtaking views of the Olympics and the Cascades. Aside from the awesome natural vistas everywhere around Stanwood, there are a number of attractions visitors should see. If you're a Richard Gere fan, the lighthouse located at the tip of Fort Worden State Park, north of Port Townsend, should look familiar. Gere's film, "An Officer and a Gentleman" was filmed around there. Another lighthouse, not similarly associated with filmdom, yet every bit as impressive, is the Point Wilson Lighthouse. Great for hikers, access to the lighthouse is via a sandy beach at the base of two high bluffs. No need to say, with the Stillaquamish River and Camano Island close by, that fishing, hiking, kayaking, and everything outdoors can be found in abundance. Golfers can try their luck at two beautiful and challenging courses: Camaloch, and Kayak Point Golf Course. You won't go hungry in Stanwood! There are 52 eateries serving everything from Thai, to trout, to tacos. Visit one of the many shops and galleries where you can purchase clothing made from alpaca wool or works of art. Visit the Pilchuck Glass School, an actual school where serious students can learn the art of glass-blowing! Or, delve a little deeper into Stanwood's history at the Floyd Norgaard Cultural Center. And Stanwood has their festivals too! In September, celebrate the harvest at Stanwood's annual Harvest Jubilee Festival & Farm Tour. Come around Christmas, and cut your own tree at two different farms in the Stanwood area. No matter when you come, Stanwood is ideally situated to all the great activities and natural beauty of Puget Sound.

Of course, most visitors will plan a trip to the Olympic National Park, which offers enough hiking trails, hidden waterfalls, rushing rivers, and climbing routes to keep any visitor busy for months.

A little closer to home, charter a scenic boat tour at John Wayne Marina or go geocaching in the Sequim-Dungeness Valley. Hike through the Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge along the Dungeness Spit (the nation's longest natural sand pit) to a lighthouse. Launch your kayak at Sequim Bay, an inlet from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, or catch shrimp, clams, oysters, and crabs at Sequim Bay State Park. Bait a silver salmon along the Dungeness River, or view the majestic herd of Roosevelt elk that roam the foothills of the Olympic Mountains.

Bicycle the Olympic Discover Trail, which connects Port Townsend to Port Angeles, or simply roam the berry fields by foot!

Whether picking fresh lavender or feeding yaks from your car window, our Sequim vacation rentals will allow you to feel right at home during your trip to the Olympic Peninsula!

You'll find great coffeehouses, several local microbreweries, and plenty of cocktail lounges and laid-back bars to suit your nightlife needs. Catch an evening of live music at the Knitting Factory (or the Spokane Symphony Orchestra, if that's more your speed), or even head to basketball game at Gonzaga University. Thanks to its proximity to the state border, Spokane is also convenient for exploring the beautiful Coeur d'Alene region! Take a scenic drive through Post Falls, stop in Coeur d'Alene for lunch, or visit the idyllic lakefront towns dotting Lake Pend Oreille and Lake Coeur d'Alene.

You could even drive up to Ohme Gardens and admire the gorgeous landscaping while taking a gentle one-mile hike around the grounds.

Because this area has such fertile land, you will pass by many orchards, vineyards, and farms on the outskirts of town. The fruit industry in particular helps fuel this town and provides many activities for visitors to enjoy. In the springtime, take photos of the cherry blossoms or plan your trip around the yearly Apple Blossom Festival. If you wait until the harvests, you can visit fruit stands, farmers markets, and orchard shops and pick up the freshest, tastiest locally grown fruit imaginable. Within a short drive of town you can also visit wineries, breweries, and cideries that transform these fresh crops into flavorful beverages.

With ample winter snow, plenty of sunshine, and the promise of fresh fruit in the summer and autumn, a trip to Wenatchee has something for everyone, whether you prefer skiing and hiking or touring orchards and visiting wineries. Check out our growing selection of comfortable and welcoming Wenatchee lodging options and see for yourself how this city in the heart of Washington will keep you coming back for more!

To enjoy a bounty of outdoor activities against the majestic backdrop of a 4,000 foot deep canyon that stretches for over 80 miles, consider a Columbia River Gorge vacation rental in peaceful Washougal, WA. Often thought of as the "Gateway to the Gorge," Washougal is a convenient location that's right at the entrance to this scenic wonderland and less than an hour drive to popular Gorge attractions like Multnomah Falls, Cascade Locks, and Bonneville Dam. In Washougal, a walk through the Steigerwald Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a joy for both hikers and bird watchers, as the refuge is hope to over 200 species of birds including Prairie Falcons, Black-necked Stilts, American Avocets, Burrowing Owls, Loggerhead Shrikes, and Sage Thrashers. For culture and history buffs, a visit to the Two Rivers Heritage Museum should be on the agenda. The collection includes over 6000 photographs and 200 oral histories of East Clark County pioneering families, as well as Native American artifacts. Of course, the Gorge's strong winds make this area one of the best wind-surfing locations in the whole world and a Washougal vacation rental is a great location for a Columbia Gorge Scenic Area adventure. Just head east on State Route 14 with your gear for a picturesque and leisurely tour on your way to wind surfing paradise. In addition to that water activity, the Columbia Gorge also offers kayaking, paddle boarding, and sailing.

Spend your time discovering this amazing area, heading back each night to your comfortable Washougal vacation rental for some relaxation and a great night's sleep.

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Mexico/Quintana-Roo/Playa-del-Carmen/
Once a sleepy fishing village, in the last 20 years the coastal town of Playa del Carmen has transformed into a bustling tourist mecca, with top-notch diving as well as a plethora of shops, restaurants, and resorts catering to an English-speaking clientele. Couples as well as families find this resort town a welcoming destination, and our Playa del Carmen vacation rentals are the perfect home-away-from-home in this bustling seaside town on the Riviera Maya.

Playa means beach, and Playa del Carmen doesn't disappoint with its great beaches! Playacar is the best spot in town. The north side can teem with tourists, so head to the more secluded and relaxing south side to avoid the crowds. If you're looking for a bit of adventure, look no further than Cenote Chaak Tun. These caves offer a place to admire stalactites and stalagmites as well as a chance to snorkel. Bring the kids, as families are welcome! Playa del Carmen is also a shopper's paradise. The main shopping thoroughfare is Quinta Avenida, and here you'll find high-end retailers such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior as well as more budget-conscious boutiques such as Zara and H&M. The street is also home to myriad restaurants and bars, including the Hard Rock Cafe and Senor Frogs. The town is a diving mecca thanks to the coral reefs off shore. Scores of scuba diving outfitters can be found in the city center. Instructors are on hand to lead even novices on dives of up to 30 feet. If you have more time - and aren't claustrophobic - get certified. Then the whole undersea world of turtles, fish, and pristine caverns will be open to you.

Coba is arguably the most celebrated attraction in the area. Just two hours from Playa, here you'll find a well-preserved Mayan city, rediscovered 120 years ago. Stroll through the ruins and admire the tropical hardwood, carved stelae and vegetation, and climb the pyramid to the top. Excavations revealed that the 80-square-mile site was an important Mayan trading post and commercial hub. Nestled in the jungle between Playa del Carmen and Tulum lies The Jungle Place Spider Monkey Conservancy. Owners Heidi and Joel rescue malnourished, ill, and abused spider monkeys, often victims of the illegal pet trade. Book an appointment, learn about the species, and make a donation to their care. However you choose to spend your time in this bustling city, the sun and the sea are never too far away from any of our Playa del Carmen vacation rentals!

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Belize/Stann-Creek/Placencia-Village/
Placencia Village sits nestled at the very end of the Placencia Peninsula, and is known for celebrating a laid-back lifestyle of relaxing on the sandy beaches while the waters of the Caribbean Sea gently lap at the shore. Vacasa's growing selection of Belize vacation rentals in Placencia Village will provide the perfect home base for your peaceful retreat (or adventure-packed getaway!).

Visitors are greeted by friendly locals and a colorful and diverse climate, and often have lodging options ranging from simple beach homes to upscale resorts. With such a lovely stretch of coastline that is popularly called "barefoot perfect," you can feel free to kick off your shoes, wriggle your toes in the warm sand, and splash around the temperate waves. In the area you can set out on a fishing expedition, take a guided sailboat tour of the nearby ocean, or go sea kayaking. For even more adventure, snorkel or scuba to discover amazing sights and sea life around the Belize Barrier Reef, the second-largest reef in the world!

Head into town and walk along one of Placencia's central roads, the pedestrian-only street called The Sidewalk. This unique thoroughfare passes many shops, restaurants, and other businesses on the way to the seashore. With many eateries, including De Tach's authentic Caribbean-style cuisine, Rumfish and its large cocktail menu, and the family-favorite Tutti Frutti ice cream shop, you will have no trouble finding great food in Placencia! You will love strolling along The Sidewalk, savoring fresh tropical fruit, and enjoying the sunshine while you leisurely explore this wonderful town. You could even take a trip up the Placencia Peninsula to check out the other small villages on the 16-mile strip of land.

Right in Placencia you can book a tour that ventures out to the barrier reef, to nearby islands, or inland to the jungles, ruins, and other attractions. A good way to find a company that offers tours is to simply stroll along The Sidewalk and watch for signs with excursion offerings! If you like to plan ahead a little more, check out Roam Belize, which has a host of options which include cultural tours to Dangriga, visits to the Mayan ruin Xunantunich, a trip to the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Preserve, zipline rides, and more! Another good option is Placencia Adventures, where you can either tour land attractions or turn your gaze out to sea and watch for manatees, go island-hopping, snorkeling, fishing, and sail around the gorgeous ocean. Many of the resorts in the area also offer tour packages, so go ahead and ask around to find an excursion that's exactly what you're looking for!

Placencia Village - derived from a word that means pleasant in English - is truly a fantastic place to spend a beach getaway. With a friendly atmosphere, gorgeous scenery, and no shortage of relaxation opportunities, you will surely want to visit this easygoing community again and again.

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Panama/Panama/Panama-City/
Panama City has become a go-to destination for travelers in the know: the capital city of Panama has quickly developed into a vacation hotspot for anyone looking to mix urbanity with culture. An international banking center, Panama City is also world renowned for its music and friendly populace. Nightlife options abound, as do great restaurants, historic neighborhoods, and cultural institutions. Dance through the streets during Carnaval, pick up a pollera—the country's national dress—or admire the colonial architecture in the old quarter. Whatever you choose, our Panama City vacation rentals are the place to stay in this culturally vibrant metropolis!

The city is known for a wealth of cultural and historic attractions. The most visited site in town is the Panama Canal. Built in 1914 at the behest of President Teddy Roosevelt to control trade routes, the canal is a modern engineering marvel. The 50-mile waterway transports ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific via gravity-powered locks, of which the Miraflores is the most intricate. Boat tours take you on an up-close and personal journey of the canal and the Panama Canal Museum boasts interactive exhibits about this example of American ingenuity. Don't miss the Bridge of the Americas, which spans the Pacific entrance to the canal, and connects North and South America.

After you've checked the must-see Panama Canal off your list, head to Casco Viejo, the city's historic district. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site to behold, with historic plazas and grand old homes on just three avenues. Situated nearby is the Frank Gehry-designed BioMuseo, featuring 13,000 square feet of exhibition space focusing on Panama's unique place in the world.

To learn a little more about the subcultures of Panama, pay a visit to the mock village of Mi Pueblito to visit replica structures depicting the Afro-Caribbean, native, and interior cultures of the nation. You can tour a colonial building displaying polleras and antiques from the 19th century.

Although it's a thriving metropolis, Panama City still has plenty of green spaces and outdoor attractions. Head to the top of Ancon Hill, a nearly 700-foot-tall landmass overlooking the city that has been thankfully saved from urbanization. You might spy sloths or nine-banded armadillos on your two-hour hike!

The Metropolitan National Park was completed in 1985 and preserves native flora and fauna, providing visitors a place to enjoy nature at its finest. The Amador Causeway links four small islands and is a great place to jog or ride a bike for a view of the ships passing in the night. Heading to the beach won't take long, as Playa Coronado is just one hour away from Panama City, and boasts miles of white sand and big city conveniences.

Heading out of Panama City, you'll come across quaint villages and of course, beautiful beaches. Comarca Kuma Yala is one of the most popular beach destinations in the country with more than 350 islands off the Caribbean coast. You'll get white powder, turquoise water and coral reefs. Don't leave without having a conversation with the Kuna people, the indigenous caretakers of this land.

Isla Colba is the country's number one diving destination with idyllic spots to sunbathe and laze the day away. The coffee capital of Boquete is a few hours by car from Panama City, but shouldn't be missed if you are a lover of the bean. The interior provinces are a world away from the heavily-treaded coastal towns, and you'll find charming mountain villages that celebrate Carnaval as if it's every day.

Sun, culture and history await you in lovely Panama City. For a relaxing stay in Panama, our Panama City vacation rentals are the perfect home away from home!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/chile/Valparaiso/
Stretching from the beautiful blue waters of the Pacific Coast near Viña del Mar to northwest of the capital of Santiago, the Valparaíso region is a stunning and rightfully popular place to visit in Chile! Whether you're hiking the streets under the colorful buildings overlooking the sea or hiking the trails around the Lake Peñuelas National Park Reserve, this area is perfect for soaking up the culture and beauty of Chile.

With towering hillsides filled with bright buildings that look out over the Pacific Ocean, the city of Valparaíso is known as "Little San Francisco" for a number of reasons! As the third-largest metropolitan area in the country, Valparaíso vacation rentals are perfectly situated near the hustle and bustle of a bigger city without losing the beauty and charm of a seaside town. The historic quarter of this city has been named a UNESCO world heritage site, and the residents (known as porteños and porteñas) have made a distinct and successful effort to keep the culture and vibrancy alive. Home to countless major festivals, street music and artists, and heaps of delicious food from the surrounding sea and valleys, you can truly soak up the Chilean culture with our Valparaíso lodging options.

Besides the beauty and business of the city of Valparaíso, the surrounding hillsides and the nearby Reserva Nacional Lago Peñuelas provide more picturesque scenery as well as places to explore. Lake Peñuelas is a man-made lake created in the early 20th century that's become a mecca for bird-watching, wildlife sight-seeing, and hiking/exploring. Just 30 kilometers southeast of the city, this area is accessible all year round. In addition to the Lake Reserve, the fertile surrounding valleys are home to many famous family-run Chilean vineyards you'll definitely want to taste-test for yourself. Of course, if you're more interested in soaking up the sun along the Pacific, there are many places to enjoy the white-sand beaches just south of Valparaíso.

Whichever way you decide to enjoy this stunning part of Chile, the Valparaíso region has endless possibilities to choose from! From swimming in the blue waters of the bay, shopping the best boutiques around, or exploring the seaside cliffs and nearby parks, there's always something interesting to find in this historic and spirited region.

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/chile/Valparaiso/Vina-del-Mar/
Find yourself easing into luxury in one of our Viña del Mar vacation rentals!

Well-to-do Chilean residents and tourists from around the globe come here to treat themselves to a relaxing week in the sun, with a totally different vibe than its southern neighbor of Valparaíso or the capital, Santiago!

Viña del Mar is home to some of (if not the most!) beautiful beaches in all of Chile. The coast beckons with countless luxury resorts, malls, and nightlife all centered around the white sands and blue water. As Chile's fourth-largest city, an urban feel abounds, with a few hotspots near our Viña del Mar vacation rentals. Plaza México and Avenida San Martín are bustling with bars, restaurants, and clubs where you can dance the night away. The seafood here is exquisite of course, so trying different restaurants all around Viña del Mar lodging is always rewarding - or you could test your luck at Casino de Viña del Mar (one of the few and oldest casinos in the country).

Naturally the beaches are the main attractions here, but to get outside and enjoy the weather in other ways, check out the National Botanic Garden, eight kilometers southeast of the city center. With 61 hectares and more than 3,000 species of plants, this beautiful area has earned Viña del Mar its nickname as "the Garden City." With numerous other well-kept parks such as Parque Quinta Vergara, there's no shortage of places to stretch your legs for a bit. The Dunas de Concon (sand dunes) are also interesting to climb or watch the sunset, but if you're more focused on getting out on the water, you can always rent surfing gear in town, or join a charter to check out some nearby scuba diving.

Whether you're adventuring a bit around the region or kicking back on one of the glorious beaches, our Viña del Mar vacation rentals will keep you in a state of serenity while you spend your time here! Discover all that this beautiful area has to offer in style.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Italy/Lazio/
Stretching from the Abruzzo mountains to the Tiber River and out to the Tyrrhenian Sea, Lazio is an amazing place to explore whether you're a city-slicker or an outdoor adventurer! Best known for its economic and cultural capital of Rome, our Lazio vacation rentals give visitors a comfortable home away from home as they explore many incredible sights such as sweeping olive fields, the Colosseum, and gorgeous remote areas like the Pontine Islands.

As the cultural giant of Lazio and Italy at large, Rome is a cosmopolitan city that has seemingly endless things to see and do! Home to about 4.3 million people, it's Italy's largest city, and literally thousands of years of history as its base make it a remarkable place to visit no matter where you're from.

Several ultra-famous landmarks dot the center of Roma, including the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps - all within walking distance from one another. Hire a guide or simply rent out some audiobooks that can give you the background history on all of these amazing artifacts!

The Vatican City is also a must-see in Roma - as the only independent state that's actually located within a city, the Vatican is a once-in-a-lifetime experience no matter what your religion! Spend your day admiring the Sistine Chapel (but make sure to keep quiet), or climb St. Peter's Basilica for panoramic views of Rome and the surrounding hillsides.

Of course, the region of Lazio offers many more sites to explore outside of its most famous metropolis. South of Rome, the Pontine Islands offer a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Ponza and Ventotene are the two bigger islands that have accommodations, restaurants, and local businesses - spend your days relaxing in the sun and devouring fresh seafood, or take a boat out for some fishing or diving! There are several ruins to explore, as well as the rugged rocks and shoreline that offer splendid views.

To the northeast of Rome, the Abruzzo mountains offer towering limestone cliffs, and there are several ski resorts where you can get to know the Italian powder. The rolling hillsides and plains near Rome supply ample fresh Italian food staples like olives and wine, and there's always something fresh to taste in this incredible region!

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Italy/Lazio/Rome/
Roma...the Eternal City! Words to describe the magic of Rome are hard to come by, but the beauty of this sparkling city speaks for itself.

With a couple millennia of history under its belt, Rome is home to some of the oldest and most famous ruins on earth...but the food, art, and dazzling nightlife will suit the most modern tastes. With around 4.3 million people, this is a true city of grit-and-grind, but the juxtaposition of ancient buildings and vibrant culture make it an unforgettable experience.

With countless things to do and places to see, our Rome vacation rentals have it all!

Thanks to its role as "the birthplace of Western civilization", Rome is brimming with ancient sites and spectacles that you absolutely must cross off the bucket list. The historic centre of the city is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site, and the most-visited tourist attraction in Italy.

You can walk to most of the popular spots, starting with the magnificent Colosseum (built in 70-80 A.D.) and the Arch of Constantine. The Pantheon has a buzzing energy that's all its own, and has been in continuous use as a spiritual center of sorts for centuries.

The Trevi Fountain is gorgeous during the day or night, but make sure you throw three coins in as not to break tradition! The Spanish Steps are no easy task to climb, but the bright flowers along the edge and view at the top are worth it. You'll get the full Italian feeling out on the narrow cobblestone streets, and there are hundreds of boutiques and restaurants to visit - be sure to try as many gelato flavors you can muster!

Sometimes called "the capital of two states", Rome also houses the Vatican City - the smallest internationally recognized independent state in the world. As the capital of the Catholic Church and home to the Pope, Vatican City is a point of pilgrimage for millions, but also an extremely interesting place to visit regardless of your religious affiliation.

St. Peter's Basilica is stunning with its towering Duomo, ornate artworks, and famous sculptures - climb to the top for an incredible panoramic view of Rome and St. Peter's Square. The Vatican museums offer world-class pieces of art, but the Sistine Chapel is truly the gem of this place, with its spectacular ceiling painted by Michelangelo. Try to keep quiet as you turn your eyes upwards, lest the Italian guards remind you!

?There are several options for day trips from our collection of Rome vacation rentals, and you likely won't even need a vehicle thanks to the high-speed trains that run in and out of the city. Just west, the Tyrrhenian Sea offers picturesque coastline and sandy beaches where you can soak up the sun, and the Pontine Islands to the south provide a quiet place of seclusion.

?The Apennine Mountains are also accessible by train, and there are several ski resorts that offer snowy outdoor adventure options. Rome's surrounding countryside is beautiful and filled with rolling hills, vineyards, and olive trees. Sabina is a great place to visit thanks to its rich culture and proximity to the country, and your tastebuds will thank you after trying some of the wines!

Whatever way you choose to enjoy this unbelievable city, your time spent in one of our Rome vacation rentals will not disappoint!

Queenstown is arguably one of the most popular stops in the entire country and for good reason! It's the adventure capital of the world, boasting a wealth of spots for bungee jumping, hot air balloon rides, and zip lining. Take a helicopter ride through the Remarkables or drift though the stillness of majestic Milford Sound. Still, this town is more than just someplace to get your adrenaline rush! It has a thriving restaurant scene, thanks to award-winning chefs and culinary maestros.

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Australia/Queensland/Brisbane/
Australia has many capital cities, but none so unique and culturally diverse as Brisbane. We have a diverse selection of Australia vacation rentals, but our Brisbane vacation rentals are the perfect way to experience this thriving metropolis in the heart of sunny Queensland.

Sitting on the Brisbane River and abutting the Pacific Ocean and New South Wales, the city of Brisbane has long been synonymous with adventure, sun, and fun! Settled by Europeans in 1823, Brisbane was once one of the harshest penal colonies in the land. However, it has transformed and is now one of the most economically booming cities in the entire country. With a world-class infrastructure (it has one of the best public transit systems in the nation), an educated populace, and a cool and hip vibe, it's no wonder Australia's new world city is one of the most popular destinations in the Antipodes.

Brisbane is a cultural mecca with a diverse range of attractions. The Gallery of Modern Art boasts rotating exhibits, as well as permanent displays of Aussie abstract and expressionist art. The Queensland Museum Sciencentre features an array of natural and scientific works, including ethnographic, biodiverse, and culturally-sensitive collections. Kids of all ages (and adults who are young at heart) will be entranced by the elaborate dinosaur exhibit.

The Macarthur Museum commemorates American General Douglas MacArthur's campaign in the South Pacific, as well as the city's involvement in the WWII. You'll experience history firsthand during your visit because Macarthur used the museum as a base during wartime. Head to the Queensland Maritime Museum to admire the warship Diamantina, the 1925 steam tug Forceful, and the South Brisbane Dry Dock. The Second/Fourteenth Light Horse Regiment (QMI) Museum honors Royal Australian Armoured Corps vets from the Second World War on and proudly displays uniforms, artifacts, and medals from the famed Light Horse brigade.

Take a ride in a vintage tram through bushland at The Brisbane Tramway Museum or stroll through the charming gardens and colonial architecture at Ormiston House, a former sugar plantation.

Brisbane basks under 12 months of sunshine and al fresco entertaining is common, even in the winter. Locals often head to city parks on weekdays and beaches on the Sunshine and Gold Coast on weekends.

The Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mount Coot-tha has 138 acres of subtropical plants arranged via geographic region, including those indigenous to the continent. The Fern House is also a particular delight. The City Botanic Gardens features a wealth of gorgeous plants, as well as ornamental ponds and bamboo groves.

It boasts a lighthouse, as well lagoons, coastal heaths, sand dunes, and fort ruins. The beaches are a great spot to spend hot summer days.

Diverse, cultured, and truly laid-back, Brisbane delights all who venture here! Our Brisbane vacation rentals will have you feeling recharged and relaxed in no time!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/New-Zealand/Otago/Queenstown/
Maori originally flocked here in search of pounamu, a type of jade that was of cultural importance. The Europeans sought gold here in 1862 and, while gold is still mined, the rush is over. But that thirst for adventure can still be found in Queenstown today! You'll meet friendly people, a laid-back atmosphere, and adventure as far as the eye can see. Stay at a Queenstown bach (the traditional New Zealand term for small vacation rental or holiday home) and you'll see for yourself why this is the hottest destination in all of New Zealand!

The highest point in town, Bob's Peak is considered to be adventure central in Queenstown. Ride the Skyline Gondola to the top and take your pick of fun activities. Want to zip line? They have it here. Want to canyon swing? They have it here. Want to bungee jump? They have it here, natch. Kids (and those young at heart) will love the two-track luge, which traverses cliff edges offering breathtaking views of the majestic peaks in the distance. After a day of activities on the summit, head down via mountain bike on the wealth of great track as you watch the Douglas Firs give way to Mountain Beech.

If you want to head out onto the water, the best way to do it is via the TSS Earnslaw. The iconic steamship makes several daily trips across Lake Wakatipu. You can explore the decks or view the engine room (they still use coal to fire it!) as you take in the sites and sounds of Queenstown.

There are a wealth of other fantastic activities to fill your days, such as helicopter tours to Lake Isabelle, high in The Remarkables, a nearby mountain range. Shoot clay pigeons with a Beretta 12-gauge shotgun or settle into the Hydro Attack, a cross between a fighter jet and a torpedo. The latter looks like a shark, traveling 50 mph under the water before rocketing through the air about 18 feet.

One of the best ways to see the town and the surrounding vistas is by hot air balloon. These early morning rides having you soaring near the clouds, savoring the scenic beauty of the Otago region. It will literally take your breath away! If you feel like hiking, Queenstown is considered to be a gateway to the Great Walks, nine walking tracks that go through the awe-inspiring landscapes of New Zealand.

Queenstown is not just an outdoor destination nonpareil. If you want to stay indoors, there's plenty to see and do. The Queenstown Arts Centre features local arts and crafts in permanent and revolving exhibits. Queenstown is home to a wealth of art galleries, showcasing local artists. Some of the best include the David John gallery, the Artbay gallery, and the Graham Brinsley gallery.

The Lakes District Museum & Gallery, one of the smallest and most cherished museums in the country, sits in the gold-mining town of Arrowtown, just 15 minutes away. The museum displays Maori relics, as well as artifacts from the gold rush era of the mid-1800s.

Historic Dudley's Cottage, also in Arrowtown, is a family-friendly spot that teaches kid's gold panning and the town's gold-mining history. You can also stroll around the gardens for a relaxing interlude between action-packed activities.

Action and adventure equals Queenstown, one of the hottest destinations in the world. Book a Queenstown vacation rental today to see for yourself why everyone loves this city at the bottom of the world!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/New-Zealand/Otago/Wanaka/
Sleepier than Queenstown but still packing an adventure wallop, Wanaka, New Zealand, is a gem of a town in the South Island. Situated on its namesake Lake Wanaka with the Southern Alps as a dramatic backdrop, the town lies in the heart of the Otago region and is the gateway to the Mt. Aspiring National Park and two large ski resorts. Relax and unwind after a day of adrenaline-pumping activities at one of our breathtaking Wanaka vacation rentals!

First settled by Maori, Europeans came in droves to Wanaka during the mid-19th-century gold rush. Many stayed behind when the gold ran out and today, the town is known as a skier's mecca and a popular place to retire.

Situated on the southern end of Lake Wanaka, Wanaka is a popular resort town in the heart of the Otago region, near Mt. Aspiring National Park on New Zealand's South Island. Wanaka is conveniently located approximately 62 km (about an hour's drive) from the Queenstown Airport (ZQN).

Lake Wanaka is the main draw and, as New Zealand's fourth largest lake, it is a sight to behold, with crystal clear waters and pristine forests. You can hike or bike around it or kayak, sail, or fish on its iridescent surface. Wanaka is also considered a gateway to New Zealand's Great Walks, nine walking tracks that allow you to explore all that this incredible country has to offer!

Wanaka is the gateway to Mt. Aspiring National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mountains rise majestically over the lake at nearly 10,000 feet, looking down on us mere mortals. The park is replete with beautiful glaciers, rivers, picturesque waterfalls, and jurassic-like forests where few humans have ventured.

Skiing is king in Wanaka and, with two of the best ski areas in the entire country, you'll never want to leave the slopes. Treble Cone is the largest ski resort on the South Island and boasts some of the most uncrowded runs you will ever come across! Cardrona Alpine Resort is perfect for beginners due to its terrain parks. Snow Farm Lodge is the perfect spot for cross-country skiing, sledding, or snow shoeing.

There are many other activities to choose from year-round, from horseback riding treks through Rippon Vineyards to biplane rides over the lake to heli-skiing on the Harris Mountains!

Arguably the hottest spot in town is Puzzling World. This family-friendly spot showcases rooms of illusion, as well as a 3D super maze, a hologram hall, and stranger-than-strange public toilets.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Balearic-Islands/
If you head to Spain, no spot will get more covetous comments from your friends back home than the gorgeous Balearic Islands. These three idyllic isles in the Mediterranean - party-hardy Ibiza, luxe Mallorca, and tranquil Menorca - boast sandy beaches, turquoise water, well-preserved ruins, and charming city boulevards. Any of our Balearic Islands vacation rentals will bring this magical land of sand and sea to you.

The Phoenicians were the first lucky inhabitants, settling here in 654 BC. The Romans, Visigoths, and Moors followed in quick succession. A busy trading center for several centuries, the area went into decline due to piracy and famine. The British ruled until 1802 but it wasn't until the 1950s that the islands' fortunes reversed. Today, all three destinations boast considerable wealth thanks to tourism. Hedonism reigns supreme in Ibiza, which sees an influx of more than two million tourists each year alone. Still, Mallorca and Menorca offer charm and relaxation aplenty and our Balearic Islands vacation rentals reinforce that feeling.

If nightlife is your scene and bikini-clad merrymaking your goal, than look no further than Ibiza. The party-loving isle is home to a club scene that rivals 1970s Manhattan. DJs are the celebrities de rigueur and many a party hopper will revel in the myriad spots to dance the night away. Still, to claim Ibiza is only for hedonists would be a disservice to this lovely island.

Ibiza City is the main port of call and while it is club-central, there are plenty of historic sites and boulevards to get lost among. The Ibiza Cathedral dominates the skyline and the whitewashed buildings of the old quarter, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Stroll through the Roman Aqueducts or The Necropolis Puig des Molins a former Phoenician settlement with 3,000 burial caverns and a museum featuring terracotta figurines. Head to the Ramparts, a fortification built on the Portal de ses Taules in 1585, which overlooks the city. The Ibiza Museu d'Art Contemporani displays a unique collection including drawings by local Mari Ribas Portmany. On the south side of the island, don't miss the well-maintained Phoenician archaeological site in Sa Caleta.

Your Ibiza holiday will features several beaches that offer a respite from the young, alcohol-fueled crowd. Cala Llenya and Cala Mastella are both small beaches (the former with soft sand, the latter with small pebbles) that are far from the madding crowds. Cala de Boix is a place to enjoy the blue water in peace and Es Figueral boasts golden sand in a turquoise-infused cove.

While Ibiza draws a younger, boisterous crowd, Mallorca in contrast is all about luxury and refinement. Many European celebrities call it home, including Rafael Nadal, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, and Claudia Schiffer. While the main city, Palma de Mallorca, and certain coastal areas have crowded beaches and cafes, the southern part of the island boasts unspoiled golden sand and nary a tourist in sight. Hike natural parks or the Tramuntana Mountains, cycle past castles and ruins, or sunbathe on more than 200 beaches.

Alaro Castle is the first stop here. Head up by foot and admire the fortifications that resisted the invasion of Alfonso II of Aragon. The Lluc Monastery is a great walk for anyone wanting to admire the mountain scenery. Capdepera Castle boasts a watchtower and housed the island's governor in the 14th century. Pollentia Alcudia is the only Roman ruin on the island. Almudaina Palace, built by the Moors in the 14th century, is now the national museum of Mallorca.

A number of great, quiet beaches await. Cala d'en Borgit is a secluded beach that's perfect for sweethearts. Cala Falco is sheltered in a cove and is great for children due to its shallow waters. Sa Rapita is another beach offering privacy as well as spots to surf, windsurf, and enjoy family fun. Your Mallorca holiday is sure to be a dream!

While Ibiza and Mallorca get the majority of those on holiday on the Balearics, Menorca is the hidden gem of the chain. Quiet and charming, the island offers a pleasing respite from the cacophony of Ibiza and Mallorca. The entire island is a UNESCO natural biosphere, which helps preserve the tranquil, rural nature of the land. You'll find rare plants as well as cozy cafes and secluded beaches at which to while away the hours.

The town of Ciutadella was built in the 14th century and is worth a tour. You can head through the bastion of Sa Font, a medieval wall that was rebuilt in the 17th century. The Llatzeret, another fort, was commissioned to keep out the Bubonic plague in 1793. The Museum of Menorca is based on a 15th century Franciscan monastery and highlights the history of occupation on the island.

Menorca has a plethora of beaches on both the north and south side of the island. The south side beaches are more touristy. Head to Mitjana, Turqueta, Son Bou, or Trebaluger for white sand and turquoise water. The north side beaches are bit harder to reach and due to that, offer plentiful seclusion. You'll spy terracotta-colored clay and coarser sand here. Cala Morell is great for snorkeling. Cala Tortuga and Pregonda are truly remote and offer peaceful coves for luxurious privacy.

Regardless of which Balearic Island seems right for you, you'll find historic sites, charming city streets, golden sand, and friendly locals. With our Balearic Island vacation rentals, you can trul

Port d'Alcudia boasts a quaint marina where fishermen ply their trade. You'll find several great beaches at which to relax. Playa de Sant Joan is a small shallow beach perfect for young children. Playa de Aucanada features a small bay but plentiful golden sand. You have to trek a bit to get to Playa Coll Baix but, it's well worth the effort due to its breathtaking views and secluded nature. If the beach is not your cup of tea, take the family to Hidropark a waterpark with myriad water slides and pools.

A stay at one of our Andratx holiday rentals will let you see for yourself why so many Europeans in the know find this town so fascinating.

Like the rest of Mallorca, Andratx was home to Romans, Moors, and others throughout history. A traditional Mallorcan town, its character and vibe hasn't changed much over the centuries. You're just as likely to see a villager hawking his wares at the weekly market as you would a tourist snapping postcard-worthy shots of the mountains. It's no wonder our Andratx holiday rentals are such a hit.

First inhabited by the Phoenicians, the town suffered numerous pirate attacks in subsequent centuries with its position near the coast. An agricultural mecca, orange, lemon, and olive groves proliferated as trade with France increased in the 17th century.

A stay at our Valencia holiday rentals will surely excite you as well.

Settled first by the Phoenicians, later the Romans, Visigoths, and Moors all invaded in successive centuries.

Calpe and the Peñón de Ifach Nature Reserve, that iconic rock that draws the eye is only seven miles away. The exclusive former fishing village of Moraira is 21 miles away and Javea and its popular beaches is only 22 miles away.

Relax and unwind in one of our Altea holiday rentals in this quaint and tranquil town on the Costa Blanca.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Calpe/
With the imposing Rock of Ifach as a backdrop, the town of Calpe on the Costa Blanca in Spain impresses all who come here. You'll find Roman baths, a nature preserve, and beautiful beaches to while away the hours. Our Calpe holiday rentals will immediately get you in a vacation mindset.

Settled by the Romans, Visigoths, and Moors, and long a quiet fishing village, the Calpe of today still offers a languid way of life. The seven-mile coastline remains the main draw with locals and tourists enjoying the sun and seaside many months out of the year. Still, there is more to see than just the sea, from ruins to natural wonder. Our Calpe holiday rentals offer a great base from which to view it all.

Situated in the northern region of Costa Blanca, Calpe is a former fishing village turned popular tourist destination on the Mediterranean coast, about 40 and 76 miles from Alicante and Valencia, respectively.

Calpe is one of the top destinations in all of Costa Blanca. First-time visitors head to the Rock of Ifach, the 1,100-foot-tall monolith that sits at the top of the old town. You get the best views of the port and beach from here and eco-warriors will delight in its protected status. Head to the Baños de la Reina, the remains of a Roman fish-salting factory.

You're steps from the old town, bordered by walls built in the 15th century, and the Moorish quarter of El Arrabal. The Moors and Christians coexisted here peacefully for centuries. You'll find ruins of the Moorish castle as well as the Iglesia Antigua de Calpe, the only remaining example of Mudejar-Gothic architecture in the region.

The beaches in Calpe are some of the best on the entire Costa Blanca. Soak up the sun on sandy shores surrounded by rugged cliffs. Windsurfing and jet skiing are popular pastimes at area beaches. La Fossa and Arenal have beautiful promenades. Les Bassetes is famous for its crystal waters and gorgeous seabed.

Calpe is the perfect spot from which to explore all of Costa Blanca and Valencia. Dénia offers beautiful beaches and ferries to Ibiza and Mallorca daily. Moraira, like Calpe, was a fishing village but has gone decidedly upscale and Altea is known for its whitewashed architecture and cobblestone streets. Javea has a large expat population so you'll feel right at home.

Explore centuries-old ruins or spend the day soaking up the rays on the gorgeous Mediterranean. Our Calpe holiday rentals make it all possible.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Denia/
Dénia enjoys an enviable reputation as a bustling Costa Blanca town with myriad things to see and do. From historical monuments to gorgeous sandy beaches to natural parks, Dénia offers a wealth of activities for all ages and our Dénia holiday rentals are the perfect perch from which to see it all.

The Iberians first settled this town centuries ago. The Romans brought wealth to the region, and the Muslims even more splendor as Dénia became the seat of the Taifa Kingdom from the 11th century on. Dénia prospered in the 19th century due to the dry raisin trade; toys put it on the map in the 20th century. Today, Denia is a town known for natural wonders, and its monuments bear witness to its unique history. A stay at a Dénia holiday rental will ensure your wellbeing.

More so than other towns in the region, Dénia offers a variety of sites from historical to natural. Archaeology buffs head to the Castell de Dénia, a fortress erected by the Moors in the 11th century. The Archaeology Museum sits alongside the Castell and features artifacts from four periods of Dénian history: the Iberian, Roman, Muslim, and Christian ages.

Climb the Gerro Tower, a watchtower that announced the arrival of the Barbary pirates in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Convent and Church of our Lady of Loreto, once home to Augustinian nuns, houses a church, cloister, and altar sculpture made of pine from the early 1940s.

Dénia was a toy mecca from the early 20th century until the 1960s. The city manufactured tin, wood, and metal toys. Children will delight in the model sailboats, horse- or mule-drawn carriages, and wood kitchen stoves on display. The Ethnographic Museum houses clothing and tools from Dénia's golden age.

A visit to the Baix La Mar neighborhood in the old town shouldn't be missed. This barrio boasts buildings from the 19th century as well as colorful squares to while away the time people watching.

Dénia is not just about history. Nature lovers will find it worthy of exploration. The Cape of San Antonio Marine Reserve features magnificent underwater sights from coral colonies to posidonia prairies. A protected reserve, you can scuba dive here but only with a special license obtained through the tourist office.

Mount Montgó Nature Park offers varied flora and fauna on more than 5,200 acres. Hike five scenic and challenging trails as you admire the maritime fennel, red lavender, royal owls, Audouin seagull, and the pilgrim falcon.

Dénia's beaches feature plentiful sand and caves. To the north of the city, lies the Les Marines area, which features popular sandy beaches such as Punta del Raset, Les Marines, Les Bovetes, Els Molins, L'Almadrava, and Les Deveses. To the south, you can swim through rocky caves in Las Rotas or relax on the sand in La Marineta Casiana.

With great historic sites and beautiful spots to hike, bike, and scuba dive, you'll never want for something to do in Dénia. Our Dénia holiday rentals make it all worthwhile.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Javea/
Situated on the Costa Blanca, Jávea is one of the top destinations in the region. A picturesque 12-mile coastline abuts an old city with historic architecture and sites. Stay at one of our Jávea holiday rentals and you'll see why so many visitors are enthralled with this beautiful town.

The Visigoths put the town on the map, building a Christian monastery here in the sixth century. The monastery still stands as does the Church of San Bartolomé and castle ruins. Today, the town is a summer playground for Europeans due to its beautiful beaches and homes with wrought iron balconies. It's become so popular that half of the population is foreign born. Come and see why our Jávea holiday rentals are much sought after.

Situated at the foot of the Montgó Massif, Jávea is in the Costa Blanca region of Spain on the Mediterranean, just under 300 miles from Barcelona and only 180 miles from the Balearic Islands. The town is separated into three sections: The old town, port, and beach area.

Jávea plays host to several historic and cultural sites of note. The Soler Blasco Archaeological and Ethnographic Museum highlights the history of the town as well as numerous works of local artist J.B. Segarra Llamas. The Parroquia de San Bartolomé is a Gothic church built to defend the city against pirates. It also saw much bombardment during the Spanish Civil War. The Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Loreto, built in 1967, is an example of avant garde architecture and its 12 beams represent the apostles.

Like many other towns in the region, the old city is separated from the port and beaches by a one-mile expanse. This was done to deter raids on the town. The Jávea coastline is a separate entity from the old town and its 12-mile swath features numerous sandy beaches. El Arenal is one of the most iconic in town and you can enjoy water sports on the white sands of Granadella Cove.

The entire Costa Blanca region is synonymous with fun, sand, and sun, and a number of towns are within an easy drive of Jávea. Ten miles to the north lies the stunning town of Dénia, the capital of the Marina Alta region. Calpe and the Peñón de Ifach Nature Reserve are just 13 miles to the south. The upscale fishing village of Moraira is seven miles south and the whitewashed architecture and winding streets of Altea are 22 miles away.

A getaway at one of our Jávea holiday rentals will never be forgotten!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Spain/Valencia/Moraira/
Once a quiet fishing village, Moraira has become one of the most exclusive resort towns in all of the Costa Blanca. Sandy beaches meet bustling promenades. Seaside cafes abut bountiful vineyards. Our Moraira holiday rentals offer the perfect refuge to enjoy all this coastal town has to offer.

Cave excavations unearthed objects belonging to prehistoric settlers. The Iberians made this there home soon after and then the Moors invaded in the seventh century, establishing irrigation systems and buildings that we still see today. Fishing was the occupation of choice for much of the residents until tourism took over post-Francisco Franco. Today, Moraira enjoys a reputation as an idyllic vacation spot for visitors with deep pockets. Stay at one of our Moraira holiday rentals to experience for yourself this beautiful town in Spain.

Situated on the Northern Costa Blanca, Moraira boasts more authentic Spanish charm than some of its trendier neighbors. Whitewashed villas look down on cobblestone streets. The Castillo de Moraira, built in 1742, provided protection from Barbary pirates and still features the seal of the Bourbon dynasty. Wear sturdy shoes as you climb to the top of Torre Vigia Cap d'Or, a watchtower that affords magnificent views of the town and its environs.

Most people who head here come for the beautiful beaches and small marina. The main beach, L'Ampolla, is sandy and busy come summer. With pine trees overlooking the bay, Playa del Portet offers turquoise water and L’Andragó, Punta Estrella, and La Cala all have clear water set in rocky coves.

A stay here wouldn't be complete without a visit to the Lonja, the daily fish auction held near the marina. Grab some fresh fish and bring it home to one of our Moraira holiday rentals for a delicious repast.

You'll find Moraria to be the perfect base from which to explore the rest of Costa Blanca and Valencia. Spend the day at the beach in Dénia and then hop on a ferry to Mallorca. Calpe was a fishing village but is now home to a wealth of beautiful sandy coves. Altea is known for its whitewashed architecture and cobblestone streets. Jávea has a large expat population so finding a meal like you'd get at home is easy as pie.

Soak in the sun and relax in a cozy cafe in Moraira. Our Moraira holiday rentals will take you there.

Vacasa is excited to announce that we will soon be offering vacation rentals in Lombardy! Learn more about the area, our property management services, view our Lombardy job openings, and please check back soon to book a Vacasa home here in Lombardy!

Where do you want to go?

Defined by its diversity from one border to another, Lombardy or Lombardia in Italian, is one of Italy's most influential areas. One of the most populated regions in the country, Lombary also has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites of any other Italian region which makes for an interesting combination of ancient history and modern conveniences. Many of our Lombardy vacation rentals are nestled among the beautiful landscape made up of mountains, lakes, hills, and plains.

Milan acts as the region's commercial epicenter and people-magnet, but there are still many incredible sights to see and locations to explore in this spectacular part of Italy. From the huge mountains in the north to the wine regions in the south, there's something for guests of all ages and interests.

Choose to stay in one of our Lombardy vacation rentals and you can spend your days devouring some risotto alla milanese, swimming in a sparkling clear blue lake, or examining a famous fresco.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Panama/Bocas-del-Toro/Bocas-del-Toro/
Laid-back and artsy during the day, vibrant and full of music by night, the city of Bocas del Toro (also called Bocas Town) is the hub of commerce and activity in the province of Bocas del Toro. Complete with Caribbean hospitality, access to delicious seafood, and sparkling beaches, our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals offer the perfect home base for your next adventure.

Whether you're looking for a relaxing retreat or an exotic escape, a stay in one of our Panama vacation rentals in Bocas del Toro is sure to be an island vacation that you'll remember for years to come.

Bocas del Toro is the capital city of the Bocas del Toro province, and sits on the southern node of Isla Colon, the largest and most populated island of the Bocas del Toro archipelago. While its closest neighbor is Isla Bastimentos, guests of our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals may easily access any of the surrounding islands, keys, and the mainland via water taxi or sail boat.

The city of Bocas del Toro is the epicenter of business for this province, but don't expect a busy and bustling city! This small, laid-back town has under 7,500 residents and no notable historical sites or museums. The cultural experience comes from interacting with the diverse locals who call this island town home.

A relaxing change of pace from what you'll find in larger places like Panama City, Bocas del Toro offers a variety of shops, dining, and tour companies, while maintaining a close-knit community feel. Enjoy a relaxed pace during the day while you wander down 1st, 2nd, and Main Street, poking about shops and admiring local goods and trinkets. Visit Simon Bolivar Park for a sampling of local cuisine, artisan crafts, and jewelry.

Take the opportunity to soak up some sun at one of the beaches on Isla Colon. Bocas del Drago is on the far side of the island and guests can reach it via bus or boat tour. This beach's mostly calm waters and sandy coral bottom make it great for snorkeling, while surfing is a must when the waves get a bit bigger! Grab lunch at Yarisnori Restaurant and then take a boat tour to Bird Island, a small outcropping off the shore where guests will enjoy watching for the red-billed tropicbird, one of Panama's rare, indigenous bird species.

Hike from Bocas del Drago to Starfish Beach, one of the only beaches in Bocas del Toro that is mostly protected from rough surf, making the water quite calm and clear. Bring snorkeling gear and get ready to check out starfish feeding. A family-friendly destination, Starfish Beach is also a wonderful spot to launch small water crafts like stand-up paddle boards and kayaks or to watch for sea turtles at night during their annual migration.

As the sun sinks and the boat tours start pulling back into their harbors, the cocktails start flowing and the music starts playing in the city of Bocas del Toro! A once sleepy town turns into a myriad of happy hour specials, live music, and scrumptious food as soon as 5 PM rolls around.

Take your bar-hop to the next level with visits to local hot spots like Barco Hundido, where guests can sip drinks out on the "wreck deck" or boogie it out on the dance floor to the beats of reggae, salsa, and merengue. Head to La Iguana, an over-the-water disco, or visit Aqua Lounge, an over-the-water bar with sea swings, sea trampolines, and some of the most exuberant parties on the island!

The archipelago is naturally designed so that guests can easily get around from island to island without too much difficulty and our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals are in the perfect locations to offer ample opportunities to explore other islands!

Isla Carenero, the closest island off the coast of Isla Colon, is a much sleepier town than Bocas del Toro. You'll find a few bed and breakfasts and a handful of seafood restaurants in Isla Carenero, including a restaurant/equipment rental called BiBi's on the Beach. After you've eaten your fill of fresh seafood (reputed to be the best in the province), rent a stand-up paddle board from BiBi's and make your way around the reefs of Carenero.

If you like surfing, Isla Carenero is the place for you - Carenero Point offers perfect tubes in the right conditions and the various waves offer water terrain for surfers of all levels - even beginners!

Whether you're here for the food, the music, the aquatic recreation, or naps on the beach, our Bocas del Toro vacation rentals keep you close to everything that this Caribbean oasis has to offer!

Where do you want to go?

Ranging from vast tracks of well-kept forest and pristine beaches to laid-back towns with a Caribbean vibe, the province of Bocas del Toro is the coastal paradise that inlanders dream of! This Caribbean getaway in northern Panama is a lovely destination for a relaxed trip your loved ones.

Bocas del Toro is a unique landscape where island and mountains meet, creating diverse geography and breathtaking scenery. Most of Bocas del Toro's main land is home to La Amistad International Park, which meets the shores of the archipelago and extends out into several islands and keys. Bocas del Toro shares its border with the Limon Province of Costa Rica, the two Panama provinces of Chiriqui and Ngobe-Bugle Comarca, and - of course - the Gulf of Mexico.

The capital city of Bocas del Toro shares its same name (although it's also known as Bocas Town) and resides on the Isla Colon.

Between sparkling waters and sugar-sand beaches, towns of happy and accommodating locals, and a rich diversity of plants and wildlife, it's no wonder that this beautiful Panama province is known as the Galapagos of the Caribbean! It is largely considered to be one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on earth.

The diversity of Bocas del Toro extends not only to the flora and fauna, but also to the people who call this beautiful oasis home. Ranging from indigenous peoples to Latinos to beach-loving gringos, this Panama province is a place rich in diversity and difference. For example, right across the water from Bocas Town is the one of the larger islands of the archipelago, Isla Bastimentos. This beautiful island is home to the Isla Bastimentos National Marine Park, the Salt Creek indigenous community, and the Red Frog Beach vacation community.

These two Government Camp vacation rentals are located on the same lot in the beautiful forest of Mt Hood and, with a combined total of seven bedrooms, can accommodate up to 30. They're perfect for hosting a large gathering in a scenic and comfortable setting.

The Big Bear Cabin will fit your large group comfortably in its 2,500 square feet and three floors.  On the main floor you will find an expansive living and dining area, complete with an extra large dining table that fits 18 guests, comfy leather couches and recliners, and a flat screen TV with a DVD player.

Downstairs are two more bedrooms; the first hosting two sets of bunk beds and a queen sized bed, and the second room containing a queen and another set of twin-over-twin bunks as well.

The Little Bear Cabin vacation rental is the smaller of the Bear cabins, but can still accommodate up to 12 guests.

It is the perfect place to gather everyone together after a day of enjoying all that Mt. Hood has to offer and relax in the cozy living room that comes complete with a wall mounted flat screen TV and entertainment center. There is also wireless internet throughout the houses so you can work and play while you are away.

In summertime, take in the sounds of beautiful Camp Creek that runs between Big and Little Bear cabins while soaking in the shared hot tub.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on Blossom Trail.  Perfect location for a group of 14 women on a hiking trip.   Lots of beds and enough bathrooms for everyone to spread out and have privacy.   Nice to be able to rent both cabins yet congregate in the large cabin for socializing.  Plenty of space.

Thanks .

Staying at Big Bear and Little Bear was great for our big family reunion. The one piece that was missing was a sufficient outdoor BBQ.

The Cabins were very nice, well equipped. The only problem is that it was very hot 95%/no air conditioning! I would never rent this property again in the summer time.

This combo of the 2 Bears gave us plenty of beds for our large group of 3 families. The living space was a little cramped, especially since the weather did not cooperate for outdoor activities. Government Camp has very few houses that fit our needs, so we would consider coming back here.

We had a retreat with 22 people at Little Bear and Big Bear. The accommodations were perfect. The houses had all the amenities that one could hope for. The internet in Little Bear was a little unpredictable but other than that we have no complaints. We had some trouble with the lock box but the staff were extremely helpful in assisting us with our issue.

We rented Big Bear and Little Bear cabins to celebrate my mom's 90th birthday.  There were 27 of us and these cabins were perfect. I was particularly impressed that all of the items in the kitchen were useful for a large group. Everything was perfect for a bunch of people. Both houses had everything we needed. We didn't even run out of hot water in the morning when we all showered. Our only problem was getting my mother up the stairs in Big Bear to the master bedroom. Fortunately we had some big guys who carried her up the stairs. We all had a great time!  I recommend this place for anyone with a large group.

The cabins were a great location for our retreat.  We had plenty of room and very comfortable accommodations.

We did not have a problem with the 'neighbor', but would have liked to have known about her crankiness prior to spending a lot of money; to then worry if my kids were going to aggravate her... they did not.

Also, would have liked to have known where the key was located to get into the heat control in Big Bear.  We did figure it out, but it was a bit of mystery for a while and it was kind of cold.  Also, instructions as to how to deal with power outages... matches for the lamps and is there a heating alternative?

Basically just little things - it was beautiful and we had a great time!

This home does not permit pets.

Nestled right near Mt. Hood, this unique Government Camp lodge retreat is the perfect destination for family reunions, business retreats, group ski getaways, or even photo shoots! With a private hot tub and sauna, six bedrooms (including four master suites and a family suite), multiple living areas and multiple decks surrounded by snow-dusted pine trees, there is plenty of space for up to 24 lucky guests in this luxurious mountain ski lodge.

Life is good on Mt. Hood, with plenty of opportunities for fun and excitement year-round. While the this lodge can sleep large groups comfortably, groups of any size will find this home spacious and relaxing,  with beautiful Craftsman-style woodwork, granite counters, and wood floors providing rustic charm and luxury.

Once inside you will find a palatial great room with 15-foot vaulted ceilings and two stories of windows looking out onto the lovely Mt. Hood scenery. A wood burning stove gives the room extra coziness and provides a classic backdrop for post-skiing hot toddies and mugs of hot chocolate.

Right next to the great room is a dining area with a large, custom wood table with bench seating. There's also additional table seating upstairs, so a large group can be eating together downstairs, with smaller groups having their own dining spot just up the steps. In fact, this home can accommodate up to 24 guests (22 comfortably), so go ahead and bring your entire family!

A well-equipped kitchen is just off the dining room and has granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances (including an impressive range), and a large butcher block island. With plenty of room for your culinary projects, there's space for Grandma to give an impromptu cookie baking lesson, or the chef in your group to whip up a hearty post-snowshoeing meal to satisfy everyone in your group.

Throughout the house there are three master suites that have king sized beds, each with their own bathrooms. Another master suite has two queen beds, in addition to a en suite bathroom. A family suite has a queen bed and an adjoining room with a futon, and there is also a bunk room that sleeps six. Of course, each room is tastefully decorated and outfitted with comfy, warm bedding so everyone will be able to claim their favorite room.

This home is also pet friendly and welcomes one dog per group with a $10 per day fee ($40 minimum per stay).

On the upper level, you'll find a large open space that looks down over the great room. This area provides a lot of room for socializing as a group, yet the size of the house will also allow for a lot of privacy when desired. It's the best of both worlds!

You'll enjoy four flat screen TVs with cable, DVD players, a DVD library, stereo, CD player, WiFi, books to read, and board games to play.

Government Camp is definitely a year-round destination for fun, outdoor activities, and relaxing near the Mt Hood National Forest wilderness. Enjoy everything this magical area has to offer with a wonderful stay at the Great Blue Lodge - a beautiful, spacious vacation retreat, minutes to ski lifts, hiking trails, and historic downtown Government Camp!

Excellent accommodations for big groups. Kitchen well stocked with equipment and lots of dishes.

We had an excellent stay for my sons 7th birthday we were able to invite 5 families and have the space for everyone to be comfortable.

Rented for a company retreat.  Plenty of room - No complaints - just wished there was snow!

This place was great. Accommodates large groups well with lots of open space. The only thing that was negative which was no big deal was the firewood is very wet so I would plan on bringing your own. Overall very cool and beautiful. Party was a success!!!!

lots of space for many families

not a 5 star spot which is nice as we were not overly concerned about leaving a ding in the floor or wearing shoes into the place, the little ones could run around, etc

My group goes up to mountain every year, this was our fifth annual trip. We'd outgrown our old cabin and we upgraded this year to Great Blue Lodge. We had an amazing time and the house was perfect for our needs. It was a big group (21 people) but we never felt crowded. From the sauna to the hot tub, close walk to Government Camp, hiking trails and just hanging out with friends in the great room, it was perfect.  We can't wait to come back next year!! Thank you Vacasa Team!

Our family (10 adults and 3 kids/babies) had a fantastic vacation here. There was plenty of room for everyone to have their own space as well as large enough common areas for everyone to be together.

The Great Blue Lodge is best termed a great Swiss Chalet, and house our family of 24 adults of children with no problem.  We loved our stay although the low temperatures needed to wood stove on at all times to keep warm.  We enjoyed the hot-tub and location of the Chalet and it close distance to Timberline and Meadows ski-resorts. If you plan to use rental equipment for skiing do this before you arrive at the Meadows as lines were long and slow.  But we had brilliant sunshine and good skiing conditions during our stay.

What a perfect venue for a reunion. Lots of space for friends and family, great big gathering space and a full stocked kitchen. Ski slopes, sleigh rides, food, and hiking trails are all within walking distance. Unfortunately we didn't have any hot water for our four day weekend and we couldn't figure out why because the sinks and dishwasher seemed to have hot water but we were a shower free bunch. Good thing there was a nice warm hot tub and we all knew and loved each other enough not to care.

Aside from the hot water, I would highly recommend this venue for a small family event, a work retreat, or a small conference. There are four different gathering areas that each allow for breakout into small sessions. There are plenty tables and chairs to accommodate everyone. The Kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, silverware, plates, and glassware that goes on for days. Before going we were hoping to better understand the room configuration so I will share here...

Top floor has two bedrooms. Each bedroom has their own private bath. And they each have a King size bed and a double futon in the room. So the two top floor rooms can accommodate four people each.

The main floor has two bedrooms as well. One is a king size bed with a master bath and sauna. (a perfect room for the event organizers) And the other has two double beds and their own private bathroom, so it can accommodate four people.

The basement has two bedroooms as well. There is a bunk room with three double bunks that can accomodate 6 people. And there is a family suite that has a double bed, a double fouton and a private bath. But this bathroom doesn't have full privacy, so if folks are sharing this room they need to be comfortable with a bathroom that opens up onto the room. Finally the basement has a public bathroom that is open to the whole house and is the closest bathroom for the bunk room.

This home is great for a large group. It's near a restaurant and small store. Our group of 15 adults was participating in the Hood to Coast Relay Race, the lodge was convenient to the start. Plenty of dining table seating, nice hot tub and  two coffee pots!

Awesome location, right across the street from the brewery- walking distance to town... house itself is HUGE with tons of space! Will definitely stay here again!

Nice large facility but needs over all attention, maintenance and a good cleaning.

The house is great for several couples vacationing together, the towels are thick and there are many places to find a quiet place to read. We loved the large entry to drop snowy boots and coats. Not appropriate for small children, the stairs and railings are dangerous.

I had a work group of 20+ people, come out for the weekend. There was plenty of room for everyone, even during the day when people had different activities going on in different areas of the house. The only downfall was that the address took us through Government camp when entered into the GPS. But once we found it, we didn't leave until we had to! Great place, highly recommended!

Excellent management and service!  It was easy to communicate with management when we had questions. There were two small issues that needed service when we arrived. Some one came out right away to resolve all issues when we called. With Best Western and restaurant Mt Hood Brewery right across the street, it's a great location for meeting up with even more people than can stay at the house. Mt Hood Brewery is kid friendly and (at least in summer) dog friendly with outdoor seating and a dog menu!  The house was beautiful, clean, and comfortable!  Can't say enough about how helpful and friendly the management was!  Also, we used Busy Bee Catering; they were also excellent!

This is a great/huge house in a great location if you plan on skiing or snowboarding. Only a mile from the private road that leads you to Timberline and about 12 miles to Mt Hood Meadows. If you choose Timberline there is a shuttle in Government Camp that can take you up there and also a trail on the mountain that allows you to ski/snowboard right into Government Camp which is pretty awesome.

The Great Blue Lodge was easy to find and a great place for groups. The kitchen was well stocked and there was plenty of room for everyone. The windows offered great views and let in plenty of sunlight, which is very nice in the wintertime.

This is a great place to stay. Highly recommended!

The property and it's amenities were wonderful. The Vacasa Staff were excellent!

I stayed here at a recent work conference, and was so impressed with the lodge's layout and furnishings. It was fantastic for meetings and group get-togethers, but also had plenty of quieter spaces and smart bedroom layouts to accommodate couples and singles alike. The decks and the hot tub were amazing too, and the kitchen was well-equipped to handle a week's worth of meal prep for a large number of hungry vacationers. I'd go back in a heartbeat - even with just a few friends.

This home was a great place for our group to gather, and we really enjoyed the hot tub and the snowy views outside.  It was also great to be right across the street from the local brewery!

The Great Blue Lodge was the perfect base for our recent trip to Government Camp. The Lodge has a great location allowing access to town by walking or through a short drive. We appreciated the rustic decor and enjoyed toasty evenings in The Great Blue siting beside the wood stove.

We stayed at this home for a work retreat and it suited our needs perfectly.  The kitchen is very large with plenty of space to cook a large meal.  The upstairs poker table and the hot tub on the deck was great for having fun after our meetings. The layout on the main floor is great with all the rooms opening off of the living room.  It is a very cozy space. I cannot wait to come back with my family!

This place is excellent for large groups, corporate retreats... WE had an amazing time both working and socializing. Our stay was memorable!!!!

This was my first trip to Mt. Hood and Government Camp and being tucked in the mountains in a cozy lodge was the best way to experience it. The lodge is right across the street from a local brewery and about a 10 minute walk from the downtown area. I felt far away from reality yet connected to creature comforts at the same time.

Plenty of room for a large group. Windows have a view of Ski bowl across the road. A very short walk to the main street in Government camp. Hot tub was great!

I loved the layout of this property. It was very neat/clean when we arrived. Plenty of silverware, plates, pots and pans for our large group. I also liked that the mud room was so large. There was tons of room for all of our snow gear. The location was super close to the cosmic ski bowl and a short drive to Mt Hood Meadows. I would love to come back and stay here again or maybe check out some other local Vacasa properties! It looks like they have a lot of other great choices in the area too!

We had an excellent time at Great Blue Lodge with our large group.  With the extra living spaces upstairs, different little groups could be enjoying a meal, watching TV, having a meeting, or catching up.  Being able to gather everyone in the main room was key to the success of our event.  The bedrooms are very clean and comfortable.  The extra fridge and large laundry room were very useful too.  Perfect spot!

The lodge is huge and beautiful! My work held a conference there and the location was perfect. There's plenty of rooms, a great kitchen, wonderful views from the huge windows, and lots of space for people to spread out. I'd definitely love to come back!

It is a little piece of paradise nestled in the woods of Mt. Hood!

This beautiful home was comfortably furnished with plenty of room to spread out. My bed was comfortable and the kitchen had everything I needed to cook a big meal for our large group. My favorite feature of the house was the long dining room table, where I spent hours with friends sharing conversations, eating tasty food, and failing miserably at poker. Star gazing from the hot tub on a shockingly clear night was the perfect end to our trip.

Great location.  lots of room for the family and friends.

Our group really enjoyed staying at this house. The location is wonderful, the house is cozy. We loved that almost every room had a bathroom. It was very clean. The only thing that was a downside for our specific group was that the house doesn't have a private game room, the living room and upstairs are very open.

It was really nice having all of the separate bathrooms for guests. Very clean, which was important to our party. Also all the beds were very comfortable. The place was well equipped for a large crowd with great kitchen setup (pots/pans/spices). great location, very close off highway but you could not hear the road at all. The long table was great for serving dinner to large crowd. Definitely will return.

I would recommend bringing a coffee grinder, more paper towels (Only included a few napkins), and your own detergent if need to use washer/dryer. It came with detergent for the one required load on leaving. that is being really picky but honestly the only things we came across.

If you're in the mood for a quaint ski town, then a Mt. Hood vacation rental  in charming Government Camp might be the destination you've been looking for! Nestled between the town of Rhododendron and the famed Timberline Lodge, Government Camp is coming into its own as a world-class skiing destination. The area around Government Camp is home to three popular ski resorts: the already mentioned Timberline, Mount Hood Skibowl, and Mount Hood Meadows. Of these, Timberline Lodge claims its own unique heritage as a Depression Era structure built by Franklin Roosevelt's WPA in 1937. Tucked right in Mount Hood National Forest, Government Camp is a also a gateway to all things summer. From your mountain cabin you can camp, bike, hike, fish, swim, kayak, raft, climb a mountain, or just watch the birds and smell the flowers. When you're done playing and have worked up an appetite, enjoy a meal in one of the many great restaurants in Government Camp like Charlie's Mountain View for prime rib sandwiches, Ice Axe Grill for cold pints of Mt. Hood Brewing Co. ale and burgers, or the new Glacier House Bistro for German-inspired fine dining. If you don't feel like eating out, a quick stop at Govy General Store will have you all stocked up for a tasty homemade meal back at your cozy ski condo. Whatever your recreational druthers, a stop along the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway at a Government Camp vacation rental has something for you!

The Roaring River Retreat, a Mt. Hood vacation rental home in Rhododendron, Oregon has everything you need to enjoy the great outdoors. This riverfront cozy cabin is rustic yet modern, with a full kitchen, fireplace, and deck, so you will love sitting outside and watching the beautiful Sandy River rush by.

This home is at the end of the street in a quiet, family-friendly neighborhood, and the back yard leads directly to the Sandy River. Additionally, Mt. Hood is just up the road (about a 20 minute drive to Government Camp), so skiing, snowboarding, or snowman-building is conveniently nearby.

Recently remodeled, this home has a charming, cabin-theme decor, with an efficient floor plan and an all-around comfortable feel.

Open up the front door of this cabin to find a mudroom, a great place to leave wet, snowy boots before entering the house. There's also a washer and dryer, so you will be able to just toss your dirty clothes in the machine after a day playing near the river or out on the mountain. Step into the living room to find a gas fireplace surrounded by comfortable seating, which means you may be content just curling up on the sofa with a cup of cocoa and watching the flickering of the fire.

For a house so compact, you will be pleased to see that the full kitchen is relatively large! The remodeled space features beautiful tile countertops plus all the necessary appliances, including a fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, dishwasher, blender, and enough pans and dishes that it will be easy to make a hot, filling breakfast or a nice dinner.

The downstairs area also has a full bathroom, plus a shelf with books and family-friendly board games. WiFi is also available throughout the house, so you won't even notice the lack of a TV in this house - there are so many other ways to relax and enjoy yourself. This property is also pet-friendly and welcomes two small dogs up to 20 pounds, with a $10 per pet, per day fee (with a $40 minimum per stay).

Upstairs is a cute loft area that has a daybed with a trundle bed and a small chair, plus the bedroom. This master bedroom features a king-size bed where you will sleep comfortably and be well-rested for another day exploring the area. This bedroom also has a half-bathroom, a sitting area great for reading, and access to a balcony that overlooks the river. Between this bedroom, the daybed in the loft, and the sofa bed in the living room, this home can accommodate up to six people.

Outside the living room is a river-facing deck with furniture, so you can watch the river or eat lunch outside on a nice day. Or, even better, use the fire pit to make a mini-meal of s'mores! But perhaps the most impressive aspect of this home is its proximity to the water; follow the short trail from the deck to reach the rushing Sandy River! There are several smaller channels and trails along the river for kids (and kids at heart) to explore for hours.

Rhododendron, a small town about an hour east of Portland, lies in a heavily-wooded, beautiful area along the river. On the other side of the highway is Welches, where you could play golf or stock up on groceries at the Thriftway, and just a few miles away is excellent mountain biking on the Sandy Ridge Trail. Plus there are a plethora of hiking options, as well as fishing in the rivers. And if your early-morning donut and coffee routine is a must-have, Sandy (just a 20-minute drive west) has a great donut shop, as well as many larger stores and restaurants.

Of course, Mt. Hood looms just to the east of this vacation home, so a short, 30-minute drive will get you to Timberline Lodge, where you can enjoy amazing skiing and snowboarding. However, you may just want to sit in your cozy rental home and enjoy the warmth of the fireplace while listening to the roar of the river.

The great outdoors is just steps away in this quiet, clean, restful Mt. Hood vacation rental, the perfect place to plan a nature-filled getaway!

Very nice placce clean and pictures are true to the place, but read your agreement  completely for noise reuirements and fines.  We were worried the whole time we were there that our dog would bark at chipmunk or something and the neighbors would complain.  Didn't have a problem with the quiet hours  just worried about noise  during the day.

This is a great little cabin with comfortable furnishings perfect for a family. Nice quiet area tucked in the woods by a river. We used it a s a base for skiing and was very nice to come home to. Love the zig zag rhododendron area! Highly recommend

Visited after a recent snow fall. The roads off the 26 highway can be filled with snow so make note of the vehicle you access the cabin with. You will need chains and/or 4 wheel drive.

The cabin is amazing. It looks small but the layout uses every space available. The main bathroom is large and the small master bathroom is convent on the second floor( no shower in the smaller bath).

The kitchen is surprisingly large and the living room and dining room are cozy. There is no door to the master bedroom so if you are bunking with friends or family do not plan on privacy inside the cabin. For a couple looking to get away for the weekend the cabin is perfect. Easy access to the Sandy river.

A great place to stay. I would go back without hesitation.

We enjoyed our stay overall

Good: Everything was furnished well - the beds and living room furniture were very comfortable. It was clean and in great condition. The kitchen and dining room were wonderful to work in. Nice having a half bath upstairs, even though the downstairs bathroom was spacious. The property is lovely & tucked into the forest.

OK: The living area was a bit small for our needs, and could use better lighting (including in the dining area).

Cons: There is poor cell service at this location. The river is close but is not really good for playing in. There is no door between the loft and the bedroom, so privacy in a larger group would be a concern.

Bad: The loft railing starts too far from the floor - this is a safely issue. Our child could have easily slipped through.

We ended up with a couple of extra days on our trip and decided to find a cabin versus stay in Portland a few more days.  This cabin had everything we needed and was an easy access to get to all the Mt Hood attractions and waterfalls! We had a nice relaxing time. We would've loved a fire pit out on the deck though!

the entire time we were here, I kept thinking how well  organized this house was. It had everything I needed, while also feeling very minimal.  The books, toys, games and movies were great.  We read the Lightening Thief, played scrabble and Bingo and Barbecued.  Lovely, relaxing and fun!   Thank you!

This is a great property and we would stay again. Just be aware that sound travels through this house as there are no doors separating the bedroom from the rest of the home. This is a perfect couples weekend get away.

The space is beautifully decorated & has tons of natural light & gorgeous views on all sides. The kitchen was large & well stocked & the half bath upstairs was great to have in addition to the full downstairs. The stairs were very slippery & steep for our older dog, just an FYI for those with senior pooches. The proximity to the river is perfect & the neighborhood is quiet & remote & has that perfect woodsy air. Aside from a incorrect WiFi password being provided initially, this property was pretty much perfect.

Although you may feel like this home is in the middle of nowhere, a ten-minute drive will bring you to restaurants and grocery stores, and you will be within a pleasant 30-minute drive of the larger city of Sandy or skiing at Timberline Lodge.

This Rhododendron getaway is impressive-looking inside and out. As soon as you step through the front door, you'll be able to appreciate the the hand-crafted architectural details, as well as the large, open living space with huge east-facing windows to let in that prized morning sunlight. A sitting area arranged next to those windows couples that amazing view with a gorgeous wood-burning, river rock fireplace. This section of the house would be a great area to gather everyone together and tell stories in front of the cozy fire.

Just past the sitting area is the living room featuring an enormous TV with cable, DVD player, Netflix streaming, and a library of DVDs to choose from. Surround-sound speakers line this space, making it a perfect place to watch an exciting movie together. More entertainment options in this home include family-friendly board games, WiFi Internet, and a telephone to stay connected. There is not cell phone service at the house and spotty in this area.

An open chef's kitchen with beautiful cabinets and gleaming stainless steel appliances will delight the cook in your group. And, with all major appliances plus a few extras like a waffle iron, blender, slow cooker, and mixer, you can cook up whatever your heart desires! A dining area has a lovely breakfast nook overlooking the back yard, plus a breakfast bar for additional diners. And out on the deck, you will have a deluxe, high-end gas grill - perfect for an afternoon cookout!

Throughout the living area are splendid, new hand-scraped Amish wood floors  and lots of windows to let in sunlight. A half-bathroom and laundry room are also on the main floor, so you won't have to worry about bringing enough clean clothes during your vacation.

The master bedroom is also located on the main floor, which is ideal for anyone who may have trouble climbing stairs. This room contains a fabulous king-size bed, a TV great for watching a late-night movie before drifting off to sleep, a brand new sliding door, and a wonderful bathroom. There you will find a walk-in shower and luxurious jetted tub, perfect for relaxing bubble baths.

Upstairs are two additional bedrooms, both with nice queen-size beds on beautiful wood frames, plus another full bathroom. With an additional sofa bed, this home has plenty of space for eight people to sleep comfortably. You may even bring two dogs to enjoy the vacation with you (a $10 fee per pet, per day, $40 minimum per stay applies).

In the garage you will discover a Ping-Pong table, a card table and chairs, and even an upright piano! Venture outside to see a new deck complete with plenty of seating for everyone to sit and enjoy the fresh air. Use the gas grill to cook up a lunch of burgers, or skip right to dessert and use the fire pit to roast up some s'mores for the group!

A fabulous hot tub on the recently-extended deck provides a great place to relax and luxuriate in the bubbling warmth. On a drizzly afternoon or a chilly evening, especially, you will love having this hot tub. A little farther afield in the two acres of property you will find a patio area with some lounge chairs that would be amazing for soaking up some sun while listening to the creek rush by.

Rhododendron is a small town nestled among the trees at the base of Mt. Hood. About an hour east of Portland, travelers drive through Rhododendron on their way to visit the mountain. The town has a few great restaurants and a small grocery store, and nearby Welches offers more dining options and a great golf course. Sandy, just half an hour west, has a huge variety of restaurants and stores, plus a theater in case you would like to catch a movie on opening day.

With the spectacular Sandy River a couple of miles away from your doorstep, and fabulous lakes including Trillium Lake (20 miles away) and Timothy Lake (30 miles away), anyone who enjoys fishing, boating, or swimming will love it here! Some of the country's best hiking and biking trails are in this area, and of course, Mt. Hood's Timberline Lodge and Mt. Hood Meadows are about a half-hour away for amazing wintertime adventures.

Whether you are seeking a laid-back, quiet place to rest for the weekend or a more activity-filled outdoor retreat, this luxurious Mt. Hood vacation rental is a perfect place to start your trip. You will simply not want to leave this fabulous, gorgeously-updated Rhododendron home!

The house itself was great- we had two families with several children, and enough space for everyone without feeling cramped.  But our favorite part was that we felt like we were out in the wilderness- but actually only drove about an hour from Portland to get there.

The hot tub was lovely, especially in the rain!

Have stayed at WyEast  for many years and it just continues to get better, the fireplace, the new flooring, the new patio doors off the master, beautiful, I will be back for sure, my dogs love the private backyard.

The internet wasn't working and u can't get  phone service out there and the lawn needed trimmed and mowed again other then that it was a 10-10

The place was fantastic. Tons of entertaining space and an awesome yard for lawn games. The property was great for the dogs as well. Definitely will be renting here again in the near future.

backyard was wonderful, my dog loved it more than we did, summer would be amazing to spend days there.  House was very comfortable, kitchen, dining area, living room were perfect size for my family of 4, of course good for many more people to gather too.

We had a wonderful 3 night stay at this cabin. You can hear the river as soon as you walk outside. Mt. Hood views are seen right through the huge, front windows. It's peaceful, quiet and with the added hot tub you are sure to relax and recoup from work and the craziness of life. This would be an amazing summer rental since the river is a stones throw away from the house. Truly a magnificent property and ideal location!

We had a wonderful time.  It was perfect for our wedding/family reunion.  The kitchen/large table in the dinning room was the perfect gathering spot.  There was a pack n play but it would have be nice to have a high chair as well.

We bring a camp to Mt Hood every year but this was the first year we used this property and we will use it again.  It was very nice and a great location for the group.

Govy Tree House is the perfect place for a stay on the mountain.  It is walking distance to trails and town yet is quiet and peaceful.  The house is well-appointed with high-quality furnishings and amenities.  Everything about the house felt great.  It seems that every item was selected with care and attention.  It was immaculate.  We loved playing games by the fire and ping pong in the garage after relaxing in the hot tub.  We'll be back for sure!  Thanks for such a wonderful weekend.

Very nice finishings, fully stocked, lots of room for family. Hot tub is nice after a long day of skiing, propane grill will fill up the hungry skiers as well.  Kids had fun playing ping pong in the garage. The only downside to this property would be the noise from the road. It is right off a very busy highway. Other than that, it is superb, and very affordable for the quality!
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Rhododendron/
Located between Zig Zag and Government Camp, Rhododendron offers all the charm of a small town in the Cascade Mountains. And like those other communities, a Rhododendron vacation rental offers peace and tranquility, with a prime location for enjoying the great outdoors spring, summer, fall, and winter! A Mt. Hood vacation rental is a wonderful retreat at any time of year. Rhododendron isn't far from five different ski resorts in the area, making it an ideal destination for winter sports. The surrounding National Forest lands are ripe with trails for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing in winter, and hiking or mountain biking in the summer. Rhododendron is also, you might say, for the birds. Bring your binoculars, ornithologists, and watch the aviaries on two of the official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails. When you get hungry, the menu in Rhododendron is surprisingly diverse. Not only does the popular coffee roaster Mt. Hood Roasters call the village home, Rhododendron has everything from ice cream to pizza to schnitzel. Whether your passion is schussing downhill, rafting, or fishing, a stay at a Rhododendron vacation rental has something great in store for you!

The home is located in the town of Rhododendron, about 21 miles from Timberline Ski Area and just a bit further to Mt. Hood Meadows Ski Resort.

You'll find two full baths down the hall, one with a tub and the other with a standalone shower.

The master lies on the second floor and features a luxurious king bed, vaulted ceilings, and wooden furniture. There's also a loft area with comfortable couches and a flatscreen TV for your enjoyment.

A hot tub awaits near the back deck, affording guests a place to unwind after a long day of skiing. The deck wraps around the property and boasts a gas grill and seating for dinner under the stars.

Rhododendron is a small town in the Cascade Mountains. It's unique location means it's the perfect base for a ski vacation. The town isn't far from five ski areas and the national forest lands nearby mean you can hike, bike, snowshoe, or cross country ski, depending on the season. It's also famous for two Oregon Cascades Birding Trails.

Expansive, chic, and with all the modern comforts, you'll feel as if you're in the clouds at this Mt. Hood vacation rental!

There's nothing like an old-school, back-country vacation to rejuvenate the mind and relax the body, to take you away from the constant stimulus of the city and into the quiet of the forest. What better way to experience Oregon's natural beauty then by staying in this gorgeous Mt. Hood vacation rental? Set at the base of Mt. Hood, you'll be surrounded on all sides by foliage and the gorgeous sloping mountainside.

Located only a few minutes away from Welches, a resort town on the western slope of Mt. Hood, this lovely  chalet in the Timberline Rim community is bright and spacious, with plenty of natural light and rustic mountain charm. Enjoy a large outdoor deck with patio furniture and a grill, perfect for summer nights of BBQ, drinks, and games of cards while the sun sets and the stars come out. You also have a garage to store your car, your kayak, your dirt bikes, or whatever other accessories you decided to bring with you.

With warm patterns, leather furniture, and blonde wood furnishing, this home is all about extreme mountain comfort. Enter from a foliage-lined path into the living space, with a gorgeous leather couch and a wood-burning stove. Enjoy the antique mountain decor, like the tree-ring table and the vintage wooden canoes displayed on the wall (please do not touch or take down from the wall - these are for decoration only).

Enjoy a kitchen meant for bustling and socializing - with the counter space and appliances set against the wall, there's plenty of standing room for cocktails or spontaneous dance parties. You have all the necessary appliances to make incredible family favorites,  and with a dishwasher and a coffee maker, everything from the start of the morning to the end of the day is quick and easy. The round, glass-topped dining table sits six comfortably. There are skylights to catch the sun throughout the day, and windows looking out onto the woods ringing your backyard.

The down stairs bedroom has a futon that comfortably sleeps two people, or can be set up in its couch position for a quiet reading/napping room. The second floor master bedroom has a queen-sized sleigh bed that is over looking the back yard. Down the hall past another full size bathroom is the third bedroom with three beds - a set of twin bunks and a full-sized trundle. All the rooms maintain that mountain comfort with geometric patterns and wilderness themes including bears dancing across the bedspreads and mountain scene throws. With two  full bathrooms, one on each floor, you'll almost never have to wait in line for the shower in the morning. All in all, this home sleeps six people.

This Timberline rental has amazing amenities, including access to the activity lodge that is shared by the neighborhood: enjoy a fitness center, tennis courts, and a pool on those hot summer days. This house has its own washer/dryer in the hall down from the kitchen for easy cleaning. This is an ideal vacation home for those looking to get away from everything: currently, the home has no cable or Internet service available, and cellphone service is spotty. There is a TV with DVD player for movie nights, though, so you won't have to completely unplug.

You will never be left bored, however, with the amazing hiking, biking, and exploring opportunities awaiting you right outside your front door. Need a break from the forest-dwelling? Head to Welches and have some tee time at the Courses Golf Club, or get a massage at one of the resorts; check your email or Skype with friends from an Internet cafe, and take a shopping trip to the Thriftway for those much-needed power snacks for hiking.

This is a great getaway spot for a group of friends looking to bond, or a small, multi-generational family enjoying a long weekend together. Come to the mountains and forget about the real world: this home is meant for clearing your mind and breathing as deeply as you can.

Please note this is a completely non-smoking and pet-free property.

We really loved the house and the place where it was located. Initially we didn't get hot water and had to call a technician to fix it.. There was no A/C or cooler so we felt pretty hot during the night time as it is peak summer.We traveled with another family and overall we enjoyed our stay and our kids had fun running around and playing with the board games there..

We used the home as our base while we ran the Mt. Hood 50 mile trail race. It was 20 minutes from the Clackamas County Ranger station (Start/Finish) so very convenient.  It is a lovely home and well stocked.  Six adults and two small children fit well.  However, its proximity to the highway made sleeping with open windows impossible. In addition, a lack of a yard limited our ability to hang out together outside.  I suspect it's perfect for skiing in the winter given it's just a couple block walk to Government Camp.  It's private too.  However, if you are looking for a place in the summer to kick back and hang outside, this may not be the place.  But if you are looking to have a home base and be away all day hiking and then have a nice place to sleep, provided you don't mind traffic noise, it is a comfortable home.

We spent 4th of July weekend at this cabin.  The cabin itself is nice with a well-equipped kitchen.  For a summer rental the upstairs bedrooms are challenging because the windows don't open and there is no screen on the door to each of the patios.  This cabin is right next to the highway, so if you leave the door open at night you will have bugs and the noise from trucks roaring down the highway all night.  Most of the other windows (downstairs bedroom, living room) do not have screens.  There was one fan provided.  In the winter this wouldn't be an issue and you would be within a short walk to a ski resort.   If you wish to sleep in the upper windows in the upstairs bedrooms do not have blinds so the light pours in.  The two double beds in the downstairs bedrooms are fine for children, but on the short side for average adult male.   Our main complaint was the noise from the highway which may be less of an issue in the winter.

This charming Government Camp rental cabin is a fantastic base for your outdoor adventures! With a private hot tub, close ski access, and room for six, this home has everything you need to enjoy the Mt. Hood area.

The location is convenient and less than half a mile to downtown Government Camp, one mile from SkiBowl, 13 miles from Timberline, and 11 miles from Mt. Hood Meadows! Spend your days out on the slopes and have a close place to relax at night. There are also several restaurants and shops in downtown Government Camp. With its gorgeous spot on a creek, you can hear water flowing by through open windows!

With wooden furnishings, high ceilings, and mountain-friendly decorations, this home feels like your own private chalet!

The living room is open and inviting with high slanted ceilings, a wood-burning stove, and flatscreen TV! The charming window seat is great for book reading, and there's plenty of room to lounge on the couch. The Southwest-inspired rug will keep your toes warm in cold months, and this is the perfect place to relax with a glass of wine while the snow falls! Around the corner, the kitchen has ample counter space and tons of amenities to help you prepare a delicious meal, including a dishwasher for cleanup.

There are six spots at the dining table near the pellet stove, as well as a wetbar for your enjoyment! On this main level, one bedroom awaits with a plush queen-size bed and lots of space to store your things.

Upstairs, the master bedroom is a fantastic retreat for two lucky guests - there are wall-to-wall windows and high ceilings, providing a luxurious feel, as well as a king-size bed. The private bathroom suite has a wonderful jetted tub and vanity. With a second full bathroom on the main floor, and a sofabed, this home can fit up to six people!

Outside, some of the best parts of this cabin beckon. The huge back deck has a six-person dining table, tiered parts where you can overlook the creek, and a lavish private hot tub! Ease your sore muscles after a day of outdoor adventure while you wait for the stars to come out. With a gas grill, it's easy to whip up some BBQ, and there's also WiFi and games to keep you entertained. There's also a private washer/dryer so you can keep your stuff warm and dry!

There's so much to see and explore in this beautiful part of Oregon. Mt. Hood is Oregon's tallest peak, and there are endless hiking, biking, and climbing routes in this area! Whether it's the cooler or warmer months, there are constant reasons to get outside, like swimming in Trillium Lake. Shred the powder on the ski slopes with your crew during the days, or head into the valley for some hiking excursions.

Hood River is about 42 miles from here with some of the world's best kite boarding, windsurfing, and sightseeing, and Portland is an easy 57 miles away. There are also several nearby mountain towns such as Rhododendron and Welches where you'll find more opportunities to shop or go out to eat.

This quintessential mountain chalet is nestled on the Southside of Mt. Hood in the village of Government Camp and is within walking distance of a variety of summer and winter activities. In the summer and fall months, you can bike and hike to many neighboring trails and lakes. In the winter months, you can spend your days on the slopes; Skibowl is in walking distance, and Timberline and Mt Hood Meadows are just minutes away. Snow shoeing, snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are also possibilities with local rental shops in Government Camp ready to suit your needs. At the end of the day, you can soak in the hot tub on the deck underneath the stars.

The chalet is three stories with two fully equipped units that can sleep up to 18 people. The upper two floors of the cabin consist of three bedrooms, 2 baths, a fully equipped kitchen, and great room. There is a large deck off the main level where you will find the hot tub. The master bedroom also resides on the main level and includes a king size bed and a set of twin bunk beds. The bath is in the hall as well as the stairway leading to the lower unit and utility room which includes a washer, dryer and a ski tuning area. The great room includes a table that seats up to 14, a glass front wood stove, Dish TV, VCR/DVD (movie library included), and a stereo.

The living area contains an entertainment center, complete with TV and VCR/DVD (movies only). The large bedroom sleeps 4 in one king and one set of bunk beds.  A wood stove, in the main living area, keeps you cozy on the coldest of days and a fresh supply of seasoned wood is just outside your door. The house offers DSL internet as well for those who need to stay connected while they are away, thought note that streaming might be a little slow.

Rustic, clean, great location. We loved the fireplace, and the big table where 17 of us sat to eat together. The hot tub was a hit after skiing. We walked to Charlie's on Friday and Saturday night to show Govy how to party!

The kitchen knives were the only dull thing about the place. Also, no proper cutting board. Lastly, a few of the locals were a little hostile to us when driving and having to share the tiny street.

This was a fantastic place to stay for any duration with some caveats. It has pretty much everything you need at a walkable distance plus all attractions just few minutes away. So the location rocks. The condition of the place including cleanliness is very good. Now to the caveats ....

The location is not good to get a good signal/reception for your mobile and to top that the WIFI never worked. I have given strict review comments to the owner about it. Either they should fix it or stop advertizing that they have any sort of internet connectivity. They have written in their instructions that if it does not work call century link but guess what I'm not there to fix the internet :-). for us it was already not working when we stepped into the house and never worked till we left.

Bottom line - if access to the internet is a must (for us it was especially with kids) this is not a reliable place for you. The reception for your mobile is not good either inside the home. If you do not care for internet this is fantastic.

Finally a rental that has plenty of bunk beds and queen/king beds in the same rooms!  This is great for multiple families staying together.  The kitchen was small but easily served our needs.  Hot tub was lovely.  We were surprised at how quiet it was despite its proximity to 26.  And lots of stars at night.  Very comfortable main spaces and bedrooms.  And we got discounted tickets at Meadows, yea!  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thanks!

At first it was not easy to find house location, maybe because we came at dusk. But then we learned our surroundings and loved location!You can walk or few minutes drive from all activities around you.

House itself is needed some updates. If you plan to cook, plan to bring most of supplies with you. Kitchen has basic, very simple stock of necessities.  House big enough for couple families. Has two separate living areas. But no big gathering room, if you like all get together.

Great time staying at the cabin. The cabin sleeps 18, but it was perfect for our group of 12. Four families each with a couple and two kids would be fine, as each room is identical in set-up, with a king and a bunk bed.

Hot tub is in awesome shape. Good to know: it's under the eaves, which you have to be careful of because of falling snow chunks.

We came in December and it was beautiful, and it snowed nearly 2 feet in 72 hours. However, when we went to dig our cars out to go skiing, there wasn't a snow shovel, and the driveway is huge and slightly inclined at the place where it meets the street (which was plowed a couple of times, but still slick). The Vacasa people sent someone out, who found a snow shovel at another rental for us to use. The only problem with that was that it was cracked. So... just make sure that your rental has a snow shovel when you stay in Govy in the winter!

Vacasa was great. House was great. The house is not super-fancy, so if you are going for luxury accomodations, this may not do it for you. However, if you are semi-laid-back and just want a great cabin, this has it all. The kitchen was well-stocked with pans and grinder and blender and everything (even salt and tp)- thank you! Nothing worse than showing up to a rental that doesn't stock salt or tp or coffee grinder.

Thanks to the owners and Vacasa

This house was perfect for our group. Our only concern was that we couldn't connect to the wifi with the password we recieved. Everything else was great!

The house was exactly how it looks in the photos. No unpleasant surprises. It was perfect for our large group. Kitchen was stocked with everything, hot tub was hot, beds were ample. Absolutely a great place to stay in Government Camp. Highly recommended.

This house is great !  the kitchen has everything you need for cooking and the hot tub was a big hit!  Foose ball was too. I stayed for 4 days and had a great time.  Worth every penny!

This is our second time at the Mt Hood Chalet and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  Plenty of room for a big family, rustic, but with ammenities to make your stay comfortable.  Close enough to skiing/snowboarding, and Government Camp is a quaint little town with friendly locals.  Definitely recommend and will stay again!

Great cabin in a great location.  It can be difficult to find if you arrive at night. Otherwise the place is amazing.

Loved the house, lots of room for large family, or friends to go and stay.

This facility works wonderfully for our Ski Camp and we will use it in the future if possible.

We had 14 grown men staying here, and it fit us perfectly, with room to spare and no one having to share a bed.  The place is great for a big group setting.  Having 2 refrigerators was super convenient as well.  The layout works really well for spreading people out at night.  Everyone had a great time and the cabin had much to do with it.  Guys were able to hit the hot tub after biking and rafting, we bbq'd and cooked for this big group with no problems, and enjoyed all hanging out together without feeling cramped at all.  The cabin was stocked with everything we could have needed: dishes, pots and pans, separate towels for the hottub, etc.

Vacasa was super easy to work with, and the Cabin is located close to skiing, and about 1 hour from Maupin for rafting.  Be sure to buy your groceries before you hit town though, as Govt Camp's stores are a little inadequate for buying for a big group.  But it was a great trip, and the cabin was a big part of it.  Thanks!!

We had a large group ski weekend for my husband's birthday and this house was absolutely ideal! There were ample towels/sheets/etc. for our large group and enough beds for everyone to sleep soundly. There is a perfectly functioning full-size hot tub also. The location was close enough that we were able to walk to the Ratskeller and have dinner one of the nights we stayed. Absolutely a wonderful location for skiiers/boarders!!

The Mount Hood Chalet is a rustic large cabin nestled in tightly between neighbors. It was spacious inside and housed 18 people comfortably. The two kitchens make it convenient to cook. Parking can be tricky. The hot tub is great! The large dining table on the second floor is perfect for hosting large groups and playing card games.

We had a problem in the lower room firestove....the airflow adjustment piece fell from the outlet tube into the fire.  We were missing a shovel which would have come in handy.  Other than that we were quite happy with the home and plan to return next year!!!  Please send an email as to when that reservation is available.  Thank You so much for a job well done by the whole team!!

Our family stayed for New Year's holiday.  The house is in a perfect location at Govy. It was well stocked and maintained. We will be back...

This house is wonderful for big groups. We had 15 of us, with kids of varying ages. Lots of space to move around and easy to be outside and play. It never felt crowded and there are actually enough beds for everyone. That is a first for our group.

Wood and wood stove were very warming after being outside. King size beds are very comfortable. Hot tub is a lot of fun late at night.

Lodge with separate studio on golf course, sleeps 15!

This beautiful Welches vacation rental is perfect for large groups: you'll not only have a beautiful home, but an above-the-garage studio that provides plenty of privacy! The main house has five spacious bedrooms and plenty of luxurious living space, while the studio has a king bed, a private bath, and a kitchenette. This home is handicap accessible.

This vacation rental is located 12 miles from Government Camp and is a 30 minute drive from Timberline Ski area or Mount Hood Meadows (see Vacasa offer above.) In the fall, you are just an hour from Hood River and a drive through some of the most beautiful orchards in the world.The Resort at the Mountain's Foxglove course is right behind this home.

Of course Welches is a golf mecca. But you've got to put down the clubs some time! And don't forget your tackle box, kayak, and/or canoe. The Sandy River is right nearby. If you need something, there are plenty of outfitters in town or close by.

As you sit in the great room of this beautiful Mt. Hood retreat, you just might have to put down your glass of Glenlivit, lay aside your journal, and walk to the grand wall of windows to check your location. No, you're not at a country estate.

Seated in the living area of this beautiful home, you just might be tempted to ring for the servant. Its massive floor to ceiling fireplace looks like something out of an English country manor. The tasteful and elegant accessories complete it's regal ambiance. And while you're up, stroll out onto the deck off the great room and savor the resplendent green of the links and the majestic peaks in the distance. Surf the internet with the free WIFI, listen to a CD, or watch a DVD or your favorite show on the 42" flat screen TV with cable. If it gets a little too hot in the summer, just turn on the central air conditioning.

This mountain getaway has room for 15. You'll feel like royalty in one of the two master suites. Both have their own propane fireplace, king bed, vaulted ceiling, and there is an indoor Jacuzzi tub as well. There are four other bedrooms, two upstairs with queen beds, one downstairs with a twin trundle, and a dormitory in the basement with two bunk beds, a twin bed and a half bath. The home has a total of three full and one half bathrooms. The entire main floor including the master bedroom and bathroom are wheelchair accessible.

Great for large gatherings, this home naturally accommodates each group's privacy. Over the two car garage and one of the bedrooms is a studio with a king bed that features a separate kitchenette and bathroom for added privacy.

If you're planning to go out to dinner, there are 13 restaurants in and around Welches with something for every palette. If you're staying in, this kitchen is a match for any culinary skill. Its beautiful hardwood floor, stainless steel appliances, and ample counter space is consistent with the elegant tone of the home with all the functionality you'd expect from a modern kitchen. Outside, you'll find a fire pit, so bring the marshmallows!

Of course Welches is a golf mecca. But you've got to put down the clubs some time! And don't forget your tackle box, kayak, and/or canoe. The Sandy River is right nearby. If you need something, there are plenty of outfitters in town or close by. The Sandy River is right nearby. If you need something, there are plenty of outfitters in town or close by.

We rented the place for a week for three couples and kids. Out of the seven days we stayed there, we caught five rainy days. At first, we were disappointed, but when we adjusted our activities, those days turned out to be the best. We had lots of talk, games, laughter, eating and drinking. The design of the house greatly helped; it separated the sleeping quarters into four zones and offered four different areas where people could gather. The kitchen was spacious and well stocked with everything we needed. In short, it was an exceptionally good choice. We might return.

Would definitely choose this property again. We stayed here in June so did not use the fireplaces but loved that they are available for cooler weather. Beautiful view from studio apartment, as well as all main living areas. Huge kitchen with ample supplies of spices, utensils, cookware, dishes, etc.

Only area of concern was the lack of hot water to clean up kitchen. Water temperature set so low that we had to heat water on the stove to clean up cooking areas and wash pots and pans.

Very nice..the guys loved being on the golf course.

We really enjoyed this property and it worked very well for our purpose. We had a work retreat weekend and the property was very spacious and allowed us to all be in the house without being cramped.

One problem the day we left was the shower and bath on the main level stopped working but it also was only 9 degrees outside that night so possibly the pipes were frozen. Hope it doesnâ€™t cause a problems for the owners. We were able to just use another shower that morning so all was good.

I recommend this house for work retreats, families with large amounts of people, large groups of people wanting to go snowboarding or skiing. Any large group of people.

Beautiful home!

We rented this house for a long guys' weekend. This house worked wonderfully in that there were beds for everyone (11 of us) and there was plenty of room to spreadout and not constantly be stepping on each other. The house was clean and tidy, though perhaps overpopulated with tchotchkes and life's detritus - there are tons of books and nick-knacks in every drawer, cupboard, and shelf (we found a book from the 1920s with a program from a 1926 Cincinnati Orchestra performance tucked in the front).

One area of concern we did have was with the cable service; there was a big football game on and we checked ahead of time to confirm the house had the basic cable service which included the channel we needed. Unfortunately, we didn't think to specifically ask whether the house also had a cable box. They don't. That meant only the analog channels offered within the basic cable package were available (and some of those, like ABC and CBS, were almost unwatchable); none of the digital channels, including Pac-12 Network were available. To their credit, the management company really impressed with their efforts to understand the problem and follow up with the homeowner and then with us. They couldn't actually fix it for us, but they tried, and I have no doubt if they could have, they would have.

The house has *tons* of dishes; there was never a shortage of silverware, plates, bowls, glassware, etc. They could have handled a small army.

One thing we noticed was that almost every room in the house has one or more mystery light switches. Seriously, in the "dining" room right next to the kitchen (where the TV is), I think there were 6 light switches in one long bank and not a single one of them seemed to do anything. It didn't help that there were many burned out light bulbs or that they used lots of regular bulbs in three way lamps.

The website said the house could accommodate 8 cars; the email and signage within the home all specify a hard limit of 5. Obviously that creates challenges if you planned on 8 but are then limited to 5; we squeezed more cars on the driveway and it worked, but it was an unpleasant surprise.

Hopefully the homeowners invest a little in the sprucing up the place, buying some decent TVs (this house has at least 3 CRT TVs) and renting a cable box, and maybe clearing out some of the clutter, but the house was big and clean and met all of our needs. All in all, we would definitely come back.

We found everything great and everyone enjoyed our family reunion time there.

Beautiful house in a little wooded golf community off the state route. House was bigger than expected (we could have slept another three people if we needed) and its location next to the 5th hole, with a view to the hills (if not Mt. Hood, alas) was tremendous. The wifi didn't work, but if you're out in the woods for the weekend, that can't be the worst thing.

This house is HUGE!  Probably the nicest rental house we have ever rented and we have rented quite a few. Thank you.

It was just an amazing place! We loved that we can be in our private areas and have the kitchen and living area as a common place to eat and just be together. The views from the house was awesome and just behind the house we enjoyed playing in the snow on the golf course. It was just an amazing experience and we will definitely be coming back to this place next year!

We had 15 family members all stay at The Lodge at Welches and we were very comfortable! We all had plenty of room and the beds were very comfortable. Lots of supplies in the kitchen. Very cozy with all of the furnishings, decorations; it just felt like home. Only thing I can think of to improve is the living/dining room could use a little more light. Got pretty dark at night. The candles helped.

Six of us (friends who went to grad school 25 years ago together) rent a house every year in a different location and this year we picked Portland which is how we found the house. We only used 4 bedrooms (2 had kings, 2 and queens) and opted not to use the kids room downstairs that has a few bunk beds and another room that has a single and trundle as these beds were not comfortable for us. The house was roomy, clean and in good condition. The oven is a Viking so it's not an easy oven to clean but it does appear to need cleaning. The coffee maker needs to be replaced. The only other deficiency in the house seemed to be with the vegetable peelers...they don't work well but this is incidental and we could all easily work with these things. What all of us didn't like was the request to start the laundry. It's not appropriate to ask guests to do this. We paid a housekeeping fee and this should cover the labor of cleaning up the house although we left it very good order. The management company wrote me a very nice e-mail explaining they ask guests to do this because it sometimes takes 9 hours to do laundry and they have to turn over the house. Turning over the house is the job of the management company and if one housekeeper is not sufficient or one washing machine is not enough, then the management company needs to hire additional housekeepers or send out the laundry. The solution is not to ask the guests to start cleaning.

Perfect house for a bunch of guys to use as a place to stay for a golf weekend.  Easily accommodated 9 of us and was WAY nicer than we are used to.  The course it is located on was great and we will definitely try to do this again.

Linda was wonderful to work with.  She cleaned the refrigerator out first so that we could get food out of coolers and into the proper place to avoid spoilage as we were off to play five hours of golf.  The house was VERY clean when we returned as she did a great job.

One concern was when trying to pay VACASA, I decided to take the check into their offices which were difficult to find as the address given appeared to be a vacant office.  I didn't want to hand over a check of other people's money to just anyone and even didn't want it to get lost in the mail, so this did cause confusion and concern.  After a few phone calls I was able to get it to the right people, but if there is any way to correct this issue, it would give a renter much more confidence in the transaction.  Thank you.  BTW, the address listed below is not the location I am referring to.  The office where I took the check was in NW Portland, but I can't remember the street.

We had not met our son-in-laws family so we used this property to merge two families.  This property was ideal.  Large enough for everyone to have their own space but with common areas for getting to know each other.  The kitchen was ideal with a commercial grade oven.  The surrounding area holds activities for everyone.  Just a great experiance.

My entire family loved our stay in Welches. I was initially hoping for a view of the Mountain but changed my expectations when I realized the terrain and old-growth trees wouldn't allow that. The deck was spacious and perfect for a happy hour watching the afternoon golfers. Beautiful! Indoors was fun, too, with fitting antique decorations and many comfy bedrooms. The kitchen was well stocked with plates, pots and pans (though it could use some more bowls?) and we enjoyed many large family meals during our stay. Thank you for a wonderful memorable family reunion on Mt Hood!

We had a big group (15) and the house fit us comfortably.  Good space, we never felt crowded.  Well equiped kitchen, nice comfortable bedrooms.  Will definitely stay again.

Good separation of space for a large group with kids. Comfortable beds and lots of places to relax.

We had 11 people stay in this house comfortably for 4 days.  There is plenty of space and the location is beautiful - Thank You so much !!!

Very large and well appointed home on the golf course.  Bedrooms spacious and comfortable.  Fireplaces are gas and super easy to use.  Kitchen is very well equipped for preparing meals.  All in all a great experience!

Cozy cabin the woods or an amenity-packed golf condo? An afternoon of skiing or snowboarding? Hiking or golfing first thing in the morning? A stay in one of our Welches vacation rentals will have you pondering tough decisions like those! Now an outdoor destination year-round, the town's humble beginnings took place back in 1882, when Samuel Welch and his son William started developing the land around the creek that would come to bear their names. From that first small getaway in 1893 to Oregon's first golf resort in 1928, Welches is now home to three golf courses, so be sure to bring your clubs! When you take a break from the links, grab your fishing rod. From its origin way up in Reid Glacier, the Salmon River runs right through Welches and with it come wild salmon and steelhead. (Fish populations are strained, so it's catch and release.) Check out The Fly Fishing Shop along Mt. Hood Highway to pick up gear, book an area fly fishing excursion, or just swap fishing tales with the staff. For a more hands-off approach to wildlife, hike the Cascade Streamwatch Trail where you can view wild fish in their natural habitat. A Mt. Hood vacation rental in Welches is the perfect destination if you're into cycling, pick from one of 45 bike routes around town. Hikers can choose from 31 trails of varying lengths and difficulty in the Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness Area. And, of course, there are plenty of places to climb, raft, horseback ride - whatever your outdoor activity of choice, it's here! But, no matter how you spend your time, you'll want to unwind after your adventure with some sweet potato fries, local grass-fed beef burgers, and cold beer at the Rendezvous Grill. Of course, just like the neighboring towns of Brightwood and Rhododendron, Welches does double duty in winter. There are four ski resorts nearby, as well as opportunities for cross country skiing, snowshoeing, tubing, and snowmobiling in the ample National Forest lands. Around the holidays, take a festive sleigh ride around the downtown. At the end of the day, you'll find there's nothing better than heading back to your Welches vacation rental, sitting down in front of a warm, toasty fire, and enjoying some hot cocoa!

Multorpor: While the name sounds other-worldly, it's actually very close to home - about an hour and a half from Portland. When you stay at this roomy, smartly appointed and spacious Government Camp vacation rental lodge with six bedrooms and room for 15, you'll be right there!

Just footsteps to Skibowl in historic and scenic Government Camp, you'll also be a short ride to Mount Hood Meadows, storied Timberline Lodge, and other ski areas.  It's the perfect place for that family reunion or business getaway. And Government Camp isn't just for winter. In summer, there are about 25 hiking trails of varying difficulty in the area, not to mention the fishing and rafting on the Sandy and great golfing up the road in Welches, about twenty minutes away.

The living room is enormous, with comfy leather chairs. And while you're relaxing, it might be hard for your eyes to choose between the forest view through the floor-to-ceiling windows, or the fire in the uniquely designed gas fireplace. With 4500 square feet of living space, six bedrooms and three bathrooms, there's plenty of room to bunk down. Lots of fun things too! Kids of all ages will love the play station. There's a BIG flat screen TV with cable and a DVD player for those movies you brought along. Shuffle the deck and enjoy a friendly game of cards at the game table. If you need to check your e-mail before you go out and play, this lodge has WiFi throughout.

A big group needs a big kitchen, and this lodge has it. With tons of cabinets and lots of counter space, there's ample room - from prep to presentation - to feed that hungry clan.

In addition to five big bedrooms with ample storage space, there are bunk beds in the lower level as well. Settle in with a book and lounge on the soft couch and chairs.

Government Camp is just a short walk away. You can pick up some things at the general store, enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal at one of the eateries, buy some equipment at one of the outfitters, arrange your day of skiing at Skibowl, or hop on the shuttle to Mount Hound Meadows. Government Camp is full of history. Timberline Lodge, Barlow Trail, Glade Trail and other places have unique histories you can learn about at the Mount Hood Cultural Center.

Get your family, friends, or coworkers together for an unforgettable getaway in this Mt. Hood vacation rental.

Nice big house.  Just make sure that you bring plenty of blankets or a space heater. The downstairs bedrooms and especially the down stairs family room are always cold. The TV in the living room is old and small. None of the lights on the loft worked. Having a said that. It's a nice big house in a great location.  If the issues were addressed this would be the ultimate mountain retreat (minus a hot tub).

This house is perfect for big groups. It's right in the middle of everything and room for everyone.

Wonderful home for a large group......The home is stocked well with all your basic needs.....

We stayed at your Multorpor home recently and found it accommodated our large group very well. Plenty of room, 3 bathrooms, and a great kitchen, with all the items we could possibly need -- it was just the ticket. We especially liked the gas fireplace -- really put out the heat!

The home is wonderful and the staff was absolutely remarkable.  They went above and beyond to fix the dishwasher and to replenish supplies.

The only issue we had was that there were several chairs that were rickety and ready to fall apart and one of them did.  The sofa was also broken, though it was a very nice sofa and still usable.  We had a great time with our extended family.  Thanks!!!

Awesome location, very spacious house, the photos don't do justice to the house ! Will stay again for sure ! !!

All 11 of us were very pleased with our stay and the surrounding area. Lots of rooms and plenty of beds. Nice size kitchen with lots of amenities. Large dining table with extra chairs through out the house, if needed. Has a nice entertainment area down stairs with 6 bunk beds for the kids. Us adults each had our own bedrooms. Also, living room is a nice size. We would love to stay here again, without a dough!

The house worked great for our group that stayed this summer.  Everyone we worked with at Vacasa was helpful and friendly.  We would definitely rent this house again.

If you are looking for a great house to accommodate 10-15 people in Government Camp this it it!

Very comfortable and well-appointed house.

It would be helpful to have some hooks on the lower level so that when people come inside from snow activities they can hang up their wet coats to dry and not have to drop them on the bench. Perhaps a wooden beam with several hooks (lots of hooks) nailed onto the big wall downstairs near the bench.

Perfect getaway home for couples or families. Private and cozy fireplace. Game room is great as well.

We loved our stay.  Perfect for our family get together of all ages. We appreciate that the kitchen was so well stocked, great appliances, beautiful rooms, great comfort.  Great location, loved the walks to town and the the night sledding at ski bowl. We have decided to make it an annual trip to this house.

Immerse yourself in history and comfort at this gorgeous 1940s-era, riverview, three-bedroom Welches vacation rental. Near ski resorts and hiking trails, right on the edge of the Mt. Hood National Forest, you'll spend your time here relaxing on the deck, soaking in the private hot tub, gathering around the massive floor-to-ceiling, rock-faced fireplace, and breathing in the fresh mountain air. This Papa Bear Cabin is even pet-friendly, so up to four of your furry family members can join you on an unforgettable Mt. Hood getaway.

The inside of this stylish Welches bungalow will remind you of a mountain lodge - with its tall ceilings, wood paneling and beams, gorgeous hardwood floors, and comfortable furniture. While the snow falls down outside, put another log on the fire, and settle back on the sofa right under the antler chandelier for an evening of chatting, reading, or watching TV. There's cable, WiFi, a DVD player, and a VCR, as well as a collection of VHS tapes to choose from.

Deck access is right through either set of the living room's French doors. Out here, you'll find a hot tub, a gas grill, and a beautiful view of the Salmon River. The water is so close, you can even dip your toes in right from the edge of the property.

This main level is spacious and open, with a china hutch, dining table, and small work area right by a black iron spiral staircase. The country-style full kitchen has an eat-in breakfast counter, stovetop/range, refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave. Smaller gadgets include a coffee grinder and toaster, so quick breakfasts before a hike are easy to prepare.

Right near the work station is a plaid-themed full bathroom with a pedestal sink and a walk-in shower. And on this level, you'll also find the first bedroom with a queen bed, brass bed frame, and a rustic, mountain cabin decor. This room also has a stacked washer and dryer, so there's no need to overpack when you stay here.

Up the spiral staircase, are the two additional bedrooms - one with a full and a twin bed, as well as another room with two twin beds. And in the upstair bathroom, you'll have a beautiful clawfoot tub for soaking - there's even a large skylight in the slanted ceiling for a tree-lined view. All bedrooms have their own TVs. In addition, a sofabed provides and extra sleeping space, so that up to seven guests can stay here at the Papa Bear Cabin. Up to four dogs are also welcome with a $10 per day, per pet fee ($40 minimum per stay).

This Welches vacation cabin is close to hiking and biking trails, river access, golfing at The Resort at the Mountains, and numerous restaurants for those evenings that you don't feel like cooking. Right along the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway there's the highly-rated Rendezvous Grill for specials like Wine Down Wednesdays, El Burro Locco for wild boar tacos, and the ZigZag Inn - be sure to try a pizza there!

In winter, you're only 13 miles from Mt. Hood Skibowl, 19 miles from Timberline Lodge, and 22 miles from Mt. Hood Meadows, so you'll want to be sure to bring your skis and snowboards! And even closer to your mountain getaway, you can enjoy cross-country skiing, snowboarding, and even snowmobiling in the Mt. Hood National Forest.

This Papa Bear Cabin in Welches is the quintessential Mt. Hood / Hood River vacation rental! Year-round, you'll enjoy classic mountain lodge ambiance, your own private hot tub with forest views, and a great location near all the area's best attractions.

Papa bear cabin was like  going home but better. Very cozy,clean and neat. Loved the huge fireplace,and the sound of the river was very relaxing.

We will be back!

My husband and I came up for the weekend with our 2 dogs.  The location is very central and we were close to hiking, restaurants and the grocery store which is great for a short stay.  We ate out at Rendezvous,  Altitude, Zigzag Mountain cafe (breakfast)  and enjoyed all 3 locations.  There are friendly neighbors with equally friendly dogs right next store so we definitely felt welcome and part of the community.  This property would also be great for a family or larger group.

I brought my family together to attend a wedding and Papa Bear's was the perfect retreat for us. My family consists of electricians and contractors, all of whom were impressed by the quality construction and how well kept the cabin is. Of course they checked: everything was to code!

The Wildwood Recreation area wetlands trails are awesome and so were the brownies from the Hazelnut Bakery in Welches. They were all so impressed with the friendly community and we enjoyed the neighborhood dogs in the 'Leash Free Animal Park".  Most of all we loved the deck and the river. We plan on making Papa Bear's cabin a family tradition. Thank you Papa Bear! Thank you Vacasa! A wonderful time was had by all.

The place was nice with a hot tub on the deck,  that was very enjoyable.   Also a Grill for cooking on the deck.  If you want piece and quiet and to be away from the phones this is the place for you!   It's located a ways off the beaten path and surrounded by beautiful trees and next to a creek.

Lovely cabin with a spectacular deck right on the Salmon River, with a better than expected hot-tub.  The kitchen was fully stocked with pans and utensils and the fridge was new.  Comfortable beds and clean towels.  I was pleasantly surprised and look forward to staying at the property again.

Amazing location right on the creek!!!  Lovely spot.

Family of four, 2 adults and 2 children (ages 14 and 6) spent an amazing 5 days at this cabin. The rental was clean and stocked with the necessary items (i.e. pots, pans, linens, etc).  The wood fireplace in the living room kept us nice and cozy at night.

The surrounding land is absolutely beautiful. Very lush and green. The sound of the running small river in the backyard was soothing too. Our kids loved playing outdoors and made friends with a couple of the neighbor's dogs. We miss "Ruby" the Great Dane especially our 6 y.o. daughter.

Our family would definitely vacation at this property again. We'd love to visit in the late summer or early fall.

Our family gives each other the 'gift of time together' for Christmas.  This year we spent it on a glorious weekend at the Papa Bear Cabin.  We loved every aspect of our stay and recommend highly.

Papa Bear Cabin is so amazing. My husband and I took his visiting parents here for a two night getaway from Portland. It was a perfect place to relax and enjoy being in the woods.

The cabin is decorated with such personality and care. We could tell that it is a special place to its owners and that it has a great history. It was very clean and comfortable. Everything was in great working shape. The grill was great. The hot tub was wonderful!

The one and only not so great thing about our stay: the driving directions were wrong on our gps and on the directions Vacasa emailed us. (Don't go right on Island Dr! Keep going straight instead.)

We would absolutely recommend staying here and hope to come back soon!

What a pristine site, right along the river with friendly neighbors nearby. No traffic and a very safe neighborhood for kids. We loved everything about it. The homeowners obviously take pride in this home and it shows in the details. If you have a chance to book this house I would do it without any hesitation. Loved it!

Truely a great experience.  Situated on Salmon River this unit is situated in a beatful area.  The cabin is very well laid out with a hot tub on the deck overlooking the river.  Nice fireplace with wood helped on the rainy days.  Could use a bit better directions on getting there.  Old Tv needs to be replaced with a flatsceen. Surround sound did not work.  The location and hottub make up for the minor faults.

The house is very nice!  The furniture and decorating is at a level of quality we appreciated.  It is in a nice neighborhood, and we had the good fortune of being able to attend a neighborhood garage sale. It was fun to meet the neighbors.  One suggestion I would have is to put more detailed information in the unit book. For example, tell people to take the yellow card to the swimming pool. And there are 3 remotes.  Explain that the Sharp remote is to turn the TV on and off and the larger remote is to change channels.  It took us a while to figure that out!  We would definitely return.

Overall the house is really fantastic. Comfortable, well appointed furniture that's contemporary with a touch of rustic. You'll be so relaxed you'll take a nap on each of the  couches and be surprised how comfortable they are.  Plenty of room to stretch out and curl up with a book or watch movies.  They even had a nice throw to use while you're taking a nap.   The kitchen is pretty well equipped, I was surprised that even the knives were of good quality; normally not the case in rentals. A larger frying pan would be helpful.  There are few board games and 3 movies in the movie library, so bring your own.  The heavy use of florescent bulbs in the house were a little jarring for the nature of the home.  We actually went out and bought incandescent bulbs at the local store and swapped them out during our week long stay. The dining table will definitely fit eight people and there is more than enough space for that many in the house.  We took the leaves out to make it fit better in the room because we had a smaller party.   The king size bed is a foam type mattress. Very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.

There's a private balcony outside the glass doors of the living room where you can take in the forest views, as well as a gas grill for BBQ. With WiFi in the lodge you can stay in touch with your family and friends back home, and there's a private washer and dryer to keep your stuff warm and dry.

This condo is perfect for any season! With shared resort amenities such as a heated pool, jacuzzi, and sauna, your muscles will thank you after a day outdoors. SkiBowl, Timberline Lodge, and Mt. Hood Meadows are all within an 11-mile radius, so any powder hounds in your group can spend the days shredding up the side of Mt. Hood.

We loved this place. Very fun. Very clean. The leisure pool in the snow was a fantastic memory the kids won't soon forget!

Our family always enjoys staying at this condo - it has all the comforts of home and is located so conveniently to everything.  It has become a tradition we look forward to every year!

We have stayed here twice now and loved it!  Great location with comfortable furnishings.   The outdoor hot tub is awesome.  The only thing missing was the snow!  It was sunny and 60 degrees...in Jaunary!

Our family (2 adults, 2 kids) had a great stay at this unit over spring break.  Close to Mt. Hood Meadows ski resort and an easy drive from Portland.  Clean, cozy and well-appointed.  We'd likely stay here again.

We always enjoy our stay and this time was no exception.  We will be back next year!!

Convenient

Walk through town and to ski

I've stayed in many Collins Lake Chalets and this was one of the best. View of the mountain was beautiful despite looking at a gravel hill.

To many great things to say about this condo!!!!  We will be staying again

My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay at this beautiful Government Camp condo. Our stay was focused on a summit climb of Mt. Hood and this property made for a perfect base camp. The condo is comfortable, well appointed, and quickly felt like home. The kitchen area is large and had everything we needed. The quick and easy access to Timberline ski area, approximately 20 minutes away, was ideal. Do be aware though that the deck looks out directly on the construction in progress of a new Ski Bowl summer area.

Wonderful place to stay. Beautiful and very calming area. Great place to relax and just unwind, recharge and have some fun!

This is the 2nd time this year we've rented this property. It's absolutely amazing. It's perfect for family fun, a romantic getaway or just somewhere to sleep that happens to be super close to skibowl food and the hwy.  Truly can't say enough positive things about this place or vacasa and the seamless checkin process!!!!

We had a fabulous time I loved playing so we will definitely come back again I was so impressed

We've stayed in this condo two years in a row now. We love its location, and all the arrangements were very professionally taken care of. The property is beautifully appointed, comfortable, well taken care of, and is very well equipped.

Very nice.especially with the sledding right out our back door. we ahve a very good, warm and fun time.

Collins Lake #138 is just phenomenal I have nothing but good things to say about it.  Let's just say that if you think the photos are nice, actually being there is times 10.  Customer service from Vacasa was top notch, which is why I will be doing business with them again and again.  They were very helpful and accommodating.  I give the crew at Vacasa thumbs up for everything and I will be referring everyone I know to do business with them.  thank you!

We enjoyed our stay! So glad we decided to stay at the chalet instead of camping! Note to self or anyone who is reading, Ski Bowl/Alpine Slide is very crowded on a holiday weekend. We did not get our money's worth because we spent so much time waiting in lines. The house was in good order with the exception of the DVD player which we could not get to work, thank goodness for the Disney Channel!

Thus was our fifth year in a row visiting mt. Hood for our August / September ski months. My husband and I skied our 57th and 58th month in a row and my sister and her husband were on their 20 and 21 month.  We have stayed at timberline and also in the resort.  This was by far our favorite experience and we already are planning on coming back.   Our only regret is that we forgot to sign the guest book in unit 138.  Please forward to the owners how much we appreciated the cleanliness and the ambiance.  So much pride of ownership was evident.  The furnishings were gorgeous right down to the dishwater.   Finally waking up to mt hood can't be beat.

It was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Thank you!

Our family thoroughly enjoyed staying at this unit.  The location was very convenient. The unit was very clean and well equipped.  Very reasonable rates. Thank you!

It was very spacious and beautiful. Loved having the comforts of home. Wonderful amenities, ie: pool, hot tub, sauna!

Wonderful experience and will definitely be back!

Great beds but satin sheets make you sweat.  Use cotton.  The TV is impossible to figure out.

Nice unit  - adequately furnished with basic pots and pans, etc.  Nice that owner has provided wireless such that you don't need to go to the lodge to get internet.  Comfortable mattresses/pillows.  Very happy with our stay.  However, owner needs to provide more information regarding using the television - couldn't view cable television.  Left an item behind accidentally and housekeeping was very responsive in returning it.  Would definitely return again if we return to Mt. Hood.

A very good value and very comfortable. The location was good for skiing at both Timberline and Mt. Hood Meadows.

Beautifully decorated, well equipped, clean, and comfortable for larger groups - we were four adults and four kids.

Great time, we really enjoyed our stay and will be back.

Great location, everything you need, soaking in the jacuzzi when snowing it is a must do. The bad: the sofa bed in living room not confortable. Bring your air mattress.

I dont usually write reviews on places but this stay was awesome! It was within walking distance of the store and local restuarants. The place was quiet and the pool and hot tub were perfect! The place was very clean and fully stocked with just about everything you would need! The beds were also extremely comfortable! Definately would recommend this place and have already sent my boss all the information and he is booking it for two weeks from now. Will absolutely stay here again!

Whether enjoying your morning coffee or your evening glass of wine, the view from the balcony of Mt Hood is breathtaking!  Accomodations were clean and had everything we needed, even plastic wine glasses for our picnic!  Just don't keep the back door open at night, you may invite in some bat friends!

We have stayed in GC many times and actually in this condo before (although we didn't realize it until we arrived.  Just a couple of small things that I left a note about 1) the bulb in the lamp in the living room was burned out 2)  Two of the burners on the stove wouldn't light however my husband was able to get one of them to work 3)  I suggest that more than one kitchen towel be available.  One meant that we used more paper towels than we like to.

Appreciated the ceiling fan in the master.  It helped to keep the upstairs cooler.   Great place, Great location  I would recommend it to a friend.   Thanks

This is the best place I have ever stayed in Govie. Very modern, clean, great sleeping arrangements, clean and well-appointed. A total pleasure!

Everything was perfect except for two things- no WiFi and the property manager could not help us with the garage door code. We were not able to open the garage door from the outside and this provided challenge when we needed to put our snow gear away. Other than that, the stay was great. Place was clean and comfortable.

Would have been nice to arrive at the property and had it warmer.  The temperature inside the unit was 55, I would recommend having it turned up when expecting travelers.  Took awhile to get it warmed up. Also,the dryer ran for only 30 mins. at a time and did not get that warm, tried to help to get some towels and sheets washed but at the rate that it was drying, we would have spent a great deal of our time waiting.

We could not tell that there was an onsite property manager, when we asked at the "office" they said they did not manage our units and we did have one small problem trying to play a DVD on the living room TV so we watched it on the little TV upstairs, but it was very convenient to have indoor parking and our children enjoyed the space to move about compared to the times we have come and stayed in a hotel.  They also enjoyed the pool very much!

Very clean, comfortable furniture, great location. Loved the spas and sauna at the clubhouse!! Well stocked kitchen; need larger fry pan and stock pot.

When you're enjoying your Parkdale vacation rental, you can be pretty sure of one thing: when you're out and about, look over your shoulder, and somewhere you're likely to see Mt. Hood. Though the name "Parkdale" might evoke images of a humble burg somewhere on the plains, the little hamlet is host to the giant adventure and fun the mountain affords. From your Mt. Hood vacation rental visit the town's museum - the Hutson House - and you'll learn that Parkdale was born of economic necessity. In 1910, two railroad men, David Eccles and R. J. McIsaac, decided they needed a place for the Mount Hood Railroad to...well, to come to an end. Parkdale is the final stop on the scenic "Fruit Loop" around the Hood River Valley. In summer, the fruit basket won't be the only thing that's full in this part of Cascade Mountain Range. You'll find a cornucopia of activities around the town of Parkdale. Put on your hiking shoes, grab your camera and head over to Frog Creek Trail or any of the other paths in the Mount Hood National Forest. Grab your tackle box and throw a line into one of 23 fishing spots in the Hood River Ranger District alone. In winter, ski and boarding buffs can ply the slopes at nearby Mt. Hood Meadows or Copper Spur Mountain Resort. When you're hungry, Parkdale offers everything from sandwiches, to steaks, to craft brewed beer. Or, from your Parkdale vacation home, drive the 12 miles north into nearby Hood River where you'll find restaurants to suit any taste. Parkdale may be the last stop on the Scenic Byway, but it's only the beginning of a good time you can enjoy the whole year-round.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Brightwood/
Biking, hiking, fly fishing, snowshoeing, skiing - a Mt. Hood vacation rental in Brightwood puts you right in the middle of the Mt. Hood National Forest and all of its stellar year-round outdoor activities! But what of this little town with the unique name? Local history has it that in 1891, one Mr. Alcorn was so impressed with the way the spring sunlight lit up the cottonwoods around the "Salmon" post office (named after the nearby river), he dubbed the place, "Brightwood." It stuck. More than a century later, this charming mountain town isn't much bigger. A Brightwood vacation rental in the beautiful Mt. Hood region is right near the confluence of the Sandy and Salmon Rivers, what's outside the little village accounts for much of the draw. Reaching out like tendrils from just beyond the village are no less than 17 bike trails of varying lengths and difficulties, making Brightwood a cyclist's paradise. One of the most popular, the Sandy Ridge Trail, follows the Sandy River and meanders through a scenic wilderness, heavily populated with native trees and wildlife. You'll definitely want to pack your camera as well as your water bottle. Sandwiched between two rivers, it's also no surprise that one of the town's most popular pastimes is fishing. Go out on your own on the Sandy River or book a fly fishing adventure with The Fly Fishing Shop in nearby Welches. Whether it's biking, hiking, or fishing, Brightwood has all the recreational perks one would expect to find in a mountain forest at an elevation of 1,164 feet. And after a day's adventure, make your way to the Brightwood Tavern for beer, food, and to hang out with the locals. In winter, it's not far at all to many of the popular ski slopes that call the area around Mount Hood their home. Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood Skibowl, and Mount Hood Meadows are all within a 30 minute drive and snowshoeing and cross country skiing are even closer in the surrounding national forest back country. Brightwood is one of the unincorporated communities in the Mount Hood Corridor and easily accessible via Oregon's I-84 east and Scenic Byway (Highway 26). Only about an hour east of Portland, it's just a short, scenic drive before you reach your charming Brightwood vacation rental in the Mt. Hood forest, where good times abound and the trees are ablaze with sunlight!

There is also a separate basement apartment that is occasionally occupied by long-term renters; the only space shared with these tenants are the basement laundry room with a washer/dryer and a convenient ski-tuning area.

In winter, Brooke and Dans is a great home-base for skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, or even snowmobiling in the nearby Mt. Hood National Forest lands. And with an ideal location right near town, on the evenings you don't feel like cooking popular eateries like the Glacier Haus Bistro and Ice Axe Grill are just a few blocks away!

In summertime, the Cascade Mountains offer hiking, biking, and fishing. Most of the ski resorts are covered in wildflowers and have operating chair lifts for a scenic ride and hike down the mountain.

Plan a retreat to the Mt. Hood vacation rental and relax surrounded by rustic elegance. Year-round, Government Camp offers fun activities and attractions for the whole family!

The description of the property indicated there was air conditioning, which was why I chose this house.  However, there was no A/C.  Although I was given a small discount after complaining, we spent two very uncomfortable days and nights.  Also, the cushions on both Futon couches/beds were so old, they were extremely hard and were unable to sleep on them.

This house was absolutely amazing. We had a group of 8 friends and there was plenty of room for all of us. Everything was so clean and the house was so cozy. It was actually a high point of our trip and we were so sad to leave it! I definitely hope to get back for another stay!

I know the Wi-Fi issue may not sound like a big deal. However, I think a more reliable system should be put in place for rentals of this type

The actual house was beautiful. However the home was not clean. We found crumbs in our bed which means the house keeper rather then changing the linens which is the cleanly thing to do decided just to remake the bed. Gross! Also we had to re wash the glasses. They were ALL covered in food and dried dish detergent. The floors had not been swept . Also after looking forward to using the hot tub we realized the water was entirely to hot (after tracking down a meat thermometer) because the hot tub was old and didn't have one. We had no way of knowing how hot or cold we were adjusting g the temp to so we were unable to use it our entire stay. Beautiful house but it's not worth the money when you have to deal with all of the things listed above.

We were generally very pleased with the house. The location is excellent, the setting is quiet but also within very easy walking distance of Government Camp's small downtown. The house is large and slept our group of 8 people very comfortably (with the exception of one of the upstairs single beds, which really needs an upgrade!).

The only real complaint we had was the hot tub -- it is clearly an older model, and it was either scalding hot, or lukewarm. We respected the owners' very clear instructions not to adjust the hot tub's temperature (the controls were not obvious in any case). But we were frustrated by not being able to use the hot tub much at all. In the mornings and early afternoon it was tepid, in the late afternoons and early evening it was quite literally scalding.

As it stands we'd recommend the house as long as people are not planning to use the hot tub much.

If the hot tub is fixed or replaced, we would recommend this house without any reservations at all!

Around the corner, the full kitchen is charming with complementing patchwork-wood cabinets, red curtains, and blue countertops where you can prepare a fantastic meal. With hanging pots and pans, wine glasses, and coffee cups, this well-stocked kitchen has a place for everything.

There are two bedrooms in this retreat, but plenty of places to sleep! The master has lovely light green walls with fresh wooden floors and furniture, as well as a delightful queen-size bed you can sink into.

The town of Hood River provides several brewery and restaurant options, and there are plenty of festivals and events happening all year round. Of course, you can also venture to the city of Portland (about an hour west) for more incredible dining options, or maybe some urban outings or sporting events like a Blazers or Timbers game.

Whether you're relaxing in your lodge getaway or enjoying the great outdoors, this Mt. Hood vacation rental has something for everyone in your group to enjoy!

We thoroughly enjoyed our four day stay at Hunter's Lodge.  The bearskin, antelope, bighorn, and other wall decorations were charming.  My papillon was sure that the bighorn was going to come off the wall and threaten us, so she kept a close eye on it.  :)   The hot tub, the hammock and firepit by the river, and the large fireplace were special treats.  The cabin was warm and dry, and was well equipped with everything we needed except for our clothes and toothbrushes.  There was a Roku with Netflix to watch when we were winding down in the evening.  We loved it!

Being from Hawaii if don't live on the Big island or Hawaii island you don't see much snow having the opportunity to show my family or to bring my family to experience the snow was the best thing about this vacation. Being a party of eight this property was perfect for all the kids and adults,  the kids having their own room to play with video games board games and each having there own bed,  for the adults having their own area to relax watch TV by the fireplace or sit and lounge on the patio what can I say it was just perfect.... I even took the kids down to the river bank a little far walk from the property but it was worth it.

My Daughter and her friend planned a Daddy Daughter ski weekend on Mt Hood. We came from around the country and stayed at this property because of it's location. The area is remote enough to be quiet and peaceful yet close enough to get on the mountain early and evenings with many restaurants!! :-)

The location is an awful spot for a rental property. It says "private" on the description and you can't see any neighbors in the photos, but that is not the case. The house is completely surrounded by homes (two of which are 10 feet away) and there is a 10 PM noise ordinance. There is a note in the house warning you that the neighbors will call the cops at 10:01 PM if there is any excess noise.

The pictures are very selective and make the property look a lot bigger than it is. The place is nice, but nowhere near as big as it looks in the photos.

Overall my experience was not bad, but I wish they had been more forthcoming with details about the property location.

This house was great, for our family! Beds comfortable, nice big table for family gatherings and kitchen is well stocked.  Plush carpets and great bathrooms. A few things you should be aware of. The picture on website is misleading this house is in a crowded neighborhood with houses within steps of it, on all sides. It is posted in the house if you are loud after 10:01 neighbor will call cops! So if you are a quiet family, this is a good house. If you want to be up late or have an area for kids to play outside, this is not the house for you.

No front door. So to get out for a walk you have to open the garage then run real fast before it shuts or go off the back deck and walk around the front. Flowers were delivered to me during the trip and if we weren't their she would of never left them. She was walking around the property until we discovered her.

We had a great time relaxing great price for a great place. I forgot my crockpot and called they were great and meet me their same day to pick it up. Thankfully it was not rented for that day. I will defiantly be back maybe try another house. Michele

We really enjoyed our stay at the cabin in Rhododendron, OR.  The house was clean and well laid out.  The kids enjoyed the kids room - each with their own spot.  All of the beds were super comfortable including very nice sheets and towels for everyone.   The kitchen and dining area were well laid out and comfortable.  We enjoyed breakfast and coffee every morning.

We happened to stay during a heat wave in August - and the lack of air-conditioning made it uncomfortable to sleep the last night.  The kids ended up sleeping in the living room.

It was very convenient to the Ski Bowl Park and the drive through Mount Hood and over to Portland made great memories.

The house is clean & comfy. Lots of games stashed away for the kiddies in the evenings if they're awake enough to play! Kitchen is small & storage for food is limited. Expect no basic seasonings for cooking sush as salt, pepper or  similar or coffee. Bring ALL of your own items! Was very nice to have washer & dryer to use after a day of hiking with three dirty boys!

This place was perfect for our needs.  Price is good.   The kitchen was well stocked,  the deck is nicely secluded and comfortable.   Plenty of room in the garage.  Beautiful place, not noisy, very private.  The upstairs den was perfect for my 3 grandchildren.

We were hoping for snow but were content with the mist and relaxing in the hot tub! I would absolutely stay here again. We had a wonderful time and were amazed by the beautiful structure of the house!

We've been renting vacation homes for the past 10 yrs and Vacasa has been the easiest to deal with - hotel like reservation process ( no back and forth rental agreements and paperwork). The cabin itself is in the town of Parkdale and near good hiking trails ( driving distance). The game room is awesome and kept the kids well entertained. The hot tub is brand new and a great addition to the property. We also had fun using the zip line ( kids and adults alike).  Beds were comfortable and small details, like fireplace set up with wood & kindling ready to use, was much appreciated.

Cedardale is a beautiful family vacation home. The lovely cabin was spacious and much bigger than we expected. Outdoors, the zipline was a huge hit with our group, children and adults alike!  The spa was terrific! And under the stars!

We spent 4 nights, and gathered for a family wedding at Miller Farm. Very convenient! Great weather!  Simply beautiful!  We loved our trip to Parkdale!

This property is gorgeous and very private. It is located back in the woods and you will not see another soul. The wood finishes in the house itself are very nice and there is tons of decking. Furniture is on the nicer side for a rental and there are tons of beds. There is no AC (fine... but it was 100 degrees the entire time we were there), no internet, no cable, no land line, and our cell phones did not work. The complete lack of those kinds of ammenities keep this property from being a 5 star. It just made this place not a good value for what we paid. The complete lack of connectivity actually made us feel a little unsafe. Kids loved the trampoline and zip line. There is access to the creek but it looked pretty swift so we just looked at it. It actually took us three tries to find it because it is way off on the edge of the property. There was a burn ban so we did not do a fire but the fire pit is nice and we liked eating the blackberries all around it. The hot tub is new, modern and a real treat. We just left the heat off entirely and it was how we cooled off.

We loved our stay.  We had fun zip lining, hot tubbing, and playing ping pong.  We loved being near Hood River, yet a short drive to our home.  It was awesome to be secluded and in a private setting.  The house accommodated quite a few people easily.  We loved the beautiful deck.  The home had everything we needed.

We really enjoyed our stay at this quiet hideaway in the woods.  The home was clean, large, and in a very pretty location.  We used the fire pit one night, and the very clean hot tub both nights.  It was a short drive to Mt Hood, and there was wine tasting and cider tasting just down the road from us.

One word of caution--if you plan on staying in the Spring, when fruit trees are in a vulnerable state on cold nights, be aware that the orchards are very close by and large, noisy fans could come on and wake you from your blissful slumber.  Bring ear plugs just in case!

Overall, we loved our stay here and had fun in the game room downstairs playing ping pong and foosball.  We definitely would stay here again.  The owner was super accommodating to us, as we added on our kids for one night after the initial reservation had been made.  Thanks again !

This home was great for my family. The kids enjoyed being able to bunk together in the same room and the game room space downstairs. The property had a lot of things for the kids to do outside which was nice! Loved the hottub and the secludedness of the property!

Enjoy the basics like a dishwasher and  microwave, and the details like a tea kettle and a coffee maker.

This floor has the second bathroom with a shower stall and a sauna (no need for to pay extra for the spa!). Up in the third, smaller loft you'll find a full futon that can also fold into a couch, and a little extra quiet for the older child in your party, or just the person who enjoys some time alone.

Besides the hot tub and the grill, enjoy other fantastic amenities: a sauna, a laundry room, and an enormous backyard for up to two pets to enjoy ($10 per pet per night, $40 minimum per stay). This home is a wonderful place for family reunions, or groups of friends meeting up for an annual shin-dig. Mt. Hood is the place to come to unwind and unplug, and this home encourages you to do so: you won't find any TVs or Internet access here. Leave your phone off, close the computer, and hit the wilderness running: hike and explore the area around you - and don't forget your binoculars. Need some urban activity? Head to Welches for golfing at The Courses, or spend some time splashing about in Lymp Reservoir. Have cook outs and bonfires at home - don't forget to bring the marshmallows!

Enjoy the natural beauty of Mt. Hood in one of the best ways you can: in a home that was built to utilize its surroundings, and made to make its guests feel like they never left home.

Our family was delighted with this charming house.  We loved the hot tub and sauna and the kids loved exploring! It's in a great location for exploring the Mount Hood area. We were able to enjoy many beautiful hikes and stunning views.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at your cabin. The beds and furnishings were very clean and comfortable. The hot tub was wonderful after a long day exploring. Lots of games and books to keep us entertained without tv or computers. There was a small hitch when we realized there wasn't any cell phone service at all. A phone in the cabin for emergency should be installed.  Would be nice if there was another light outside for the lager area of the deck also.  I couldn't imagine staying a bustling hotel when you could have such a peaceful place for half the price.

Dog friendly, hot tub, sauna, and a large house to host a group of friends. It's a great place to unplug from technology, sit back and sip a glass of wine, and play some board games. Very low key and relaxing atmosphere. Needs a few updates, but overall it had a lot of charm.

Our group of friends chose this rest location for a weekend of gaming and relaxation.  The price was right, and the open vaulted great room was a nice touch.  The jacuzzi/sauna room were a nice touch.  Kitchen appliances re dated however and are in need of a refresh.  Satisfied!

We knew going in that there wouldn't be any tv or phone (very limited cell service) but thought what we were paying would justify the condition of the house. We booked  the house early November for the Christmas holiday. We also knew we would be paying premium pricing for that time of year but we also thought the house was going to be worth it, which it was not. We definitely were taken advantage of based on timing and lack of other available options and we wanted to be in Welches. Needless to say, we learned our lesson in renting during prime time. Please don't rent this house  anytime for $275.00/night - its not justified.

Cozy home close to skiing with space for 12

Come experience the beautiful union of sustainability and craftsmanship in this eco-friendly Government Camp vacation rental lodge. True to its pedigree as the first restaurant in Government Camp, it has been lovingly repurposed using up-cycled and locally sourced woods, dedicated now to serving as your own private mountain refuge. Wonderfully equipped for large groups with two living areas, a large dining hall, and amenities like Netflix and free WiFi, you'll also have easy access to all the seasonal activities - hiking, fishing, skiing - that come with the natural beauty and abundance of the Mount Hood region.

Step into the living area where the pale, knotted wood walls, wood floors, and hand-crafted furniture (locally sourced from Sustainable Northwest Woods) envelopes you in an atmosphere that's classic lodge. After a stroll into town and a visit to the local shops and general store, come back to the comfort of your own private Government Camp lodge and relax before dinner. If it's chilly, flip on the gas fireplace, reminiscent (yet more efficient) of an old stove. The big shovel, barrel, and wall-mounted sled add to the charming, rustic decor.

A big group has a big appetite, and this large, fully equipped kitchen is up to the task of satisfying it! Yes, you could sit down at one of the eateries in colorful Government Camp serving everything from shepherd's pie to prime rib, but you needn't bother. Your designated chefs will have everything they need to create a hearty meal any time of day. From the new gas stove, to the big fridge, microwave, and voluminous counter space, this kitchen is the perfect combination of beauty and efficiency. When the meal's done, serve it up at the long table by the window with room for 10. Clean ups will be a breeze with the dishwasher.  (And, bring along some of your favorite beans for the coffee grinder!)

With its four bedrooms and loft, this spacious Government Camp vacation rental lodge strikes just the right balance between comfort and size. You'll enjoy the exquisite feel of high-end, organic linen sheets and duvet, and you'll sleep on beds locally crafted by Cotton Cloud (note that the mattresses on these custom, hand-made beds are a little firmer than most, and without a box spring). The wood-lined character of the lodge continues in two bedrooms on the main floor, one with a queen bed, the other a twin bunk. There's a tastefully decorated, full bathroom with a walk-in shower on this level as well.

Hold the rough-hewn banister securely as you make your way to the upper level. Up here, you'll find a bedroom with a comfy queen bed and a big dresser. Step into the second bedroom and you'll find two twin bunks. There's fun up on the upper level as well! Relax in the second living area where you can listen to a CD, watch a DVD, or just settle in with a book or magazine. There's room for more on the futons in the loft, bringing the total to 12. In addition to two full bathrooms, there's also a washer and dryer for your convenience.

From this roomy and rustic Government Camp vacation rental, you'll enjoy mountain views and vistas of the ski slopes in the distance. And speaking of skiing, winter is premier in Government Camp, offering you a number of venues to test your skills. Skibowl and Summit Meadows are right in town. Trek up beautiful Glade Trail to Timblerline where you can also visit the iconic Timberline Lodge. Head southeast around the other side of Mount Hood (about a half-hour's drive) to Mount Hood Meadows.

In summer, Government Camp is a perfect gateway for hiking and biking, with 25 trails. The Salmon and Sandy rivers are close by, so that means great fishing. And golfers: tee up at Foxglove, about 15 minutes away.

No matter when you come, this rustic and eco-friendly Government Camp vacation rental lodge is waiting to make your stay comfortable and memorable, offering a doorway to all the great sites and activities in the Mount Hood area!

We enjoyed staying at this cabin and would definitely rent it again. It warmed up quickly, offered good space for our family, and had everything we needed. The cabin is nice and a fair price. Thanks!

The flying stag is a wonderful mountain get away. The property is blocks for historic government camp, extensive trail network and of course majestic mount hood. The accommodations are plush. You feel worlds away and in our busy work world this is a retreat that is worth much more than the price for the night. Come and you will enjoy. I have and will again at least annually.

Pretty cool spot. Nice wood everywhere. Good for large group of ski coaches. Easy walk to town.

Great location.  Well stocked kitchen.  We will come again.

The governing board for Leadership Clark County needed a location for our annual retreat on the night of June 19th and all day June 20th, and as board chair, I suggested trying the Flying Stag Lodge.  The location was perfect for our large group - plenty of sleeping areas, and most importantly, a wonderful large table and living room for our 14 members to gather and meet.  The lodge has plenty of personality, and we loved finding such a large place right in the heart of Government Camp.  Many of our members have commented that this was a perfect location and I for one look forward to returning on a vacation.  The lodge would be great for a multi family ski trip or summer vacation.

Flying Stag was great! From organic linens, to a giant and well appointed kitchen, to lovely handcrafted couches, curtains and more, it's the best place on Mt Hood, hands down!

celebrated a birthday party with loads of friends.  very comfortable cozy space and in an excellent location!  we really enjoyed our stay

We loved our stay at Flying Stag! It has a mountain retreat feel, interesting dÃ©cor and many fun options for sitting with small or larger groups. The kitchen is set up so that two people can be cooking as others are sitting across the island enjoying the action - very social. The long tables fit our group of 18 very easily for meals. And the couches around the fire were comfortable and created the right setting for our strategic planning conversations.  The beds were very comfortable and made with beautiful linens, and the diversity of sleeping options fit our group well (with kids, couples and singles). And the location canâ€™t be beat - right next to the shops and a short walk up to the trails surrounding Government Camp. Thank you for the beautiful retreat spot!

Members of my organization stayed at the Flying Stag Lodge March 14-15th. Its a great location for a small office retreat or team building weekend!

We stayed at this property for a planning retreat. It comfortably fit our entire team; the layout of the building provides for a surprising amount of privacy and quiet working space. The beautiful mountain scenery, combined with the rustic design of the interior made for a very cozy weekend. Cooking in the updated kitchen was a pleasure and eating meals in the dining area easily accommodated a dozen folks. I am inspired to return soon with my extended family.

The Flying Stag is beautiful. The beds are very comfortable and clean and the house is tidy. All they need were some better knives for cooking with!  Interacting with the owners was easy and pleasant. The location is great for getting to all the attractions around, and quiet. I personally like to be more away, but the easy walk to the little town is fun. We had a great time in this little place with a great view!

Relax and spread out in this amazing Government Camp vacation rental. Big Bear Cabin, a 2,800 square feet vacation rental with three floors, is located at the base of the mountain in the scenic mountain woods, and offers up to 18 people a chance to forget their worries and get lost in the woods - without losing out on modern convenience.

The Big Bear Lodge vacation rental is a traditional log home built with extra large logs for a unique look. On the main floor you will find an expansive living and dining area, complete with an extra large dining table that fits all 18 guests, comfy leather couches and recliners, and a flat screen TV with a DVD player. You and your guests will love admiring all the antiques hanging on the walls - old snowshoes, cross country skis, bobsleds, and even an old ski trail sign.

The expansive kitchen with granite countertops and modern appliances is a chef's dream - in fact, its size means that multiple cooks can be in the kitchen at once, prepping and cleaning up as a group! Enjoy fun gadgets like a coffee grinder and a blender, and a dishwasher for easy cleaning.

Sleep will be deep and comfortable here - no need to put anyone on the sofa. A beautiful master bedroom sits on the main floor as well and includes a queen sized bed with its own private bathroom, and pretty furnishings, including a bear statuette on top of the wardrobe!

Downstairs is also a mud room perfect for stacking icy gear, and a laundry room to keep all your active wear fresh. This home is just the right size for a large family or ski team!

You're welcome to bring up to four dogs along, just remember the $10 per pet, per night fee, with a minimum of $40 per stay.

The cabin is located close to the base of Glade Trail, which is connected to Timberline Ski Area and a favorite with snowboarders, skiers, and those who like to snowshoe. In summertime, take in the sounds of beautiful Camp Creek that runs between Big and Little Bear cabins while you soak in the spacious hot tub. The summertime means plenty of hiking around Mt. Hood to places like Timothy Lake and Mirror Lake, and Portland is just an hour away for some city time.

This gorgeous Mt. Hood  getaway is a magical getaway for the whole family - and we really do mean the whole family!

If you are looking to bring along even more friends or family, the Little Bear Cabin (the red and white house in the pictures) sits directly behind Big Bear and can house up to 12 more guests. Big Bear and Little Bear do share a hot tub.

This place fit our group's needs perfectly. We had a bunch of folks looking to hang out in Government Camp, go hiking, and have relaxed fun. There are a ton of beds in this spot and all the amenities were solid. The neighbors were a bit worried in the beginning that we would be too loud - they probably have to deal with that too much - but at the end of our stay they came over to thank us for being so quiet. This is definitely a regular rental property - so don't expect a cozy homeowner type spot, but there are good things that come with that too. They've got all the rental arrangements on lock down - good rental instructions, sturdy everything, working hot tub, and all the tools you'll need to have an excellent trip. Really fantastic spot in my view. Thanks guys!

We really enjoyed the space with our grandkids.  Plenty of room and nice space for everyone.  The kitchen and supplies made cooking a joy. A nice walk to the downtown area to.   Everyone in the neighborhood friendly to.

15 of us went  to Mt. Hood for spring break and Big Bear was great! Convenient location, friendly proper staff and all the comforts of home! Would definitely stay again.

The big bear cabin was perfect for our work retreat!  The log cabin aesthetic was beautiful, the cabin was easy to get to, and the space was very open and inviting.  Vacasa does a great job of making it easy to stay there with simple instructions for running the dishwasher, laundry, etc and the check-out process is very simple and really eliminated the usual stress of cleaning up after such a large group.  My only complaints: there wasn't a dustpan (which we needed on multiple occasions), the stove doesn't light well, and the instructions to get into the house (how to work the key code) were outdated.  We spent 30 min standing outside at 9pm waiting to get proper instructions on how to get into the house.  Parking is also very limited for such a big cabin.  Thanks for making our retreat a big success!

over all it was quite enjoyable, we plan to come back.

Our high school ski team stayed in this cabin and everyone loved it.  It was convenient, clean, and there was room enough for everyone!  Thank you for sharing your warm cabin with us!

We Celebrated Our Family Christmas in The Big Bear Cabin at Government Camp! We have adult sons, with wives and they have children. The log cabin is sooooo beautiful, large, comfy and very well equipped!  Safe even for our youngest a 2 1/2 year old. There was no hoped for snow (1st time in ten years on Mt. Hood) , but we played many inside games, made lots of homemade hearty meals in the nice kitchen and enjoyed the local area, even have horse drawn carriage rides!!! We had a wonderful time!!!! We will be doing this again!!!

This is a beautiful home. The proximity is close to everything including a hill to sled on and the mountain to ski.  The hot tub could be better maintained and a little more thorough cleaning between guests. We tried cosmic night tuning which was awesome.

This is a great cabin for a large group.

We had 4 families so each had a bedroom and the kids loved changing it up in all the bunk beds and twins.

About 10 of us stayed here for my birthday. We were going to hit the bars in Govy but ended up staying in the cabin the whole time because it was so comfortable. We played beer pong on the long dining room table and watched movies on the big screen. The only complaint about the entire cabin is that it didnt have a fireplace. Overall lots of fun and we would defiantly rent this property again.

Big bear cabin was an amazing experience I loved it very much it's the Best

It was like a Winter Wonderland at Government Camp. We stayed at Big Bear Cabin--lots of room, pet-friendly, and great comfort. Noise does carry, though, because of all the wooden floors. Still, it was a lovely experience, especially going out into the snow right outside the cabin and then coming in for some hot chocolate and gingerbread cookies. What a thrilling time we had!!

It was wonderful to have a white Christmas!  Big Bear Cabin was warm and comfortable allowing our big family to make special memories together.  It was unforgetable!

Very beautiful fun place to stay. Sleeps lots of people and nice to have lots of bedrooms to choose from. Close to government camp downtown area. Would love to stay again. Vacasa was friendly and sent helpful emails during the whole process.

the big bear cabin was the perfect fit for our group. We had fun sking all day and relaxing all night. The TVs and sterio setup was top of the line with every hook up needed hdmi, aux for zune iPod dock it was all there so what ever you had it was ready. the kitchen was also set upup in the same fashion. Very nice high end apliances and utensils. Beds were amazingly  comfortable woth 500 thread count sheets and goose down pillows. Loved the antiques on the walls.    Some left out information is that the picture make it seem like the cabin is out i. The Woods by it self but in real life there are cabin all over 20ft in every direcrion.  Overall a very great stay and very comfotable. Thank you vacasa rentals.

Start the morning with chocolate chip pancakes before a hike through the Mt. Hood National Forest and end the day with a big bowl of popcorn in front of the fire. There's also a dining room table with seating for eight and a few extra spots at the breakfast bar for nights when you want to gather everyone around for a sit-down meal.

The spacious outdoor deck extends the full length of the house and includes a private hot tub surrounded by trees. End the evening with a luxurious soak and if the weather is rainy or snowing, extend the large umbrella and stay protected from the elements. On sunny afternoons, use the gas grill to cook up a feast and when it's done you don't even need to head inside for the meal - there's plenty of room on the deck for dining al fresco.

A bedroom on the main floor is bright and airy, with deck access right near the hot tub. This peaceful oasis has a king sized bed, large closet, and its own private bathroom. And up the carpeted stairs are the two additional bedrooms and a bonus room. There's a queen bedroom with matching furniture, including a bedside table and dresser, and an additional bedroom with twin over queen bunk beds.

The bonus room has two more twin beds (great for kids!) and an additional 42-inch flat screen TV. This is an ideal layout if you want to set the kids up in here with a movie or boardgames, while the adults congregate downstairs for cocktails and their own flick. This Mt. Hood condo will comfortably sleep up to nine guests (six adults), making it perfect for family getaways or couples with kids traveling together.

Additional amenities at this Golf and Ski retreat include a full-sized washer and dryer in the neat and tidy laundry room, WiFi, and central air conditioning. And when you want to get outside and do something, if you want to stay close to home, you have access to some of the wonderful Resort at the Mountain amenities - the swimming pool, hot tub, and tennis courts!

This Welches vacation condo has a great location right on the outskirts of the Mt. Hood National Forest and the Salmon River Valley. In spring, summer, or fall, spend the day exploring the area's many hiking and biking trails, while you make your way past lush forests and sparkling waterfalls. Golfers will want to pack their clubs and spend the day at The Courses - a spectacular 27-hole course that's only a few hundred feet away.

In winter, there are a number of ski resorts to choose from, including Timberline Lodge, Mt. Hood Meadows, and Mt. Hood Skibowl - all within a 30 minute drive away. There are also ample opportunities for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling practically right outside your door!

For a memorable getaway in the great outdoors, this Welches retreat offers comfort, amenities, and location. It's an ideal Mt. Hood vacation rental for the whole family!

My first experience with VRBO. Will be my "go to" in the future.

Property well maintained, well equipped, very comfortable and perfect for the family wedding experience! Thank you for a beautiful home to enjoy!

Our group had a wonderful time! The location was convenient and very pleasant overlooking the golf course. The home was clean and nicely furnished. We enjoyed the hot tub, ping pong table, relaxing by the fireplace and cooking several meals in the kitchen.

I don't usually hit all the starts for a review - but everyone in our party loved the place for all the above reasons. I would also like to give special high marks to staff at the front desk at the lodge. VERY helpful and professional. We'll be back.

We had a group of five adults and three kids, and everyone had a cozy place to sleep. The kitchen is well-appointed. We also enjoyed the hot tub. The house is as wonderful as the pictures!

We decided to leave all the Christmas hustle and bustle behind and escape to the woods...what we got were four days of uninterrupted family time. This was priceless. The cabin slept a rotating cast of family and felt comfortable and warm as home. The cabin was sparsely decorated for Christmas which was considerate and made our stay perfect. Thank you! Highly recommended.

This was one of two properties rented to accommodate family members for a family reunion. It's location near both the resort and our other rental was excellent. We would definitely rent this unit again.

The incredible great room, with its vaulted ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the back deck and Foxglove Golf Course, is the perfect place to gather as a group before the roaring fireplace. Spread out onto the deck for a cookout, cocktails, or a soak in the hot tub.

Go around the corner to a more casual sitting area, a perfect spot for reading in the afternoon.

This wonderful and peaceful Mt. Hood vacation rental is waiting to welcome you to Northwest in style.

Lovely, spacious home, slept 3 families comfortably. Beautiful location, great amenities, strong WiFi which is often an issue in mountain homes. Highly recommend!

What a wonderful way to bring family together. Cousins from Washington and all over Oregon, and as far away as Florida were able to all come together after nearly 2 decades, just like when we were kids.  I would come back every year if I could.

My College-age Daughter kept saying, "we're just going to stay."

This is the second time we have stayed in this house.  We had 3 families and it fit us very comfortably.  The room downstairs for the kids was perfect (we had kids ranging in age from 7-10).  They could hang out and play down there while the adults had their space upstairs.  The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals. The house is very clean and beautiful inside (vaulted ceilings).  It is all nicely set up and a very comfortable house.

Overall this was a terrific experience because we all needed a break and away from school after our finals. This experience reminded us how to appreciate things in life and enjoy the moment with one another. The house was gorgeous and had everything that we needed. One of the best experiences we had as a group. Will be coming back in the future again.

Thank You Vacasa!

This cozy 1500 sq.ft. Mt. Hood vacation rental cabin awaits your next ski weekend, golf retreat, or fishing getaway! This charming vacation rental cabin offers the best possible combination of rustic mountain decor and modern comforts and conveniences, all with a fantastic location within easy walking distance of the ZigZag River in the Mt. Hood National Forest.

From its exposed timber beams and warm hardwood floors to its beautiful cozy quilts, this vacation rental cabin will make you feel instantly relaxed and at home on Mt. Hood. Despite its rustic style, the cabin has been recently renovated and features plenty of creature comforts such as soft sofas, flat-screen TVs, wireless Internet access, and a beautifully equipped kitchen. The shop is open for you to tune and store your mountain equipment and there's also a Ping-Pong table and basketball hoop inside so no matter the weather, Game On!

The living area is open and spacious, and comfortable Pendleton style Sofa and Chair  with a large live edge coffee table ready for your card game with an old-fashioned wood stove and large HD flat-screen TV for extra-cozy movie nights. Through a wide open doorway is the newly remodeled kitchen, complete with gas range, dishwasher, microwave, toaster, waffle iron, mixer, coffeemaker, coffee grinder, crockpot and all the cookware, serving ware, and utensils needed to feed a hungry group of hikers or ski/boarders. The breakfast bar has two stools for a quick bite, and a dining table with pull out extendable leafs.

In warmer weather, head out to the wraparound deck perfect for unwinding after a great day on the mountain and have a barbecue on the gas grill. The ZigZag River flows through the quiet neighborhood, beckoning you to walk down to the banks and watch the water pass by.

In the evening, take your pick from three bedrooms. Upstairs, the master bedroom has a handsome queen bed with log-hewn frame. The second bedroom has a queen bed of its own. Downstairs, the third bedroom is a festive bunk room that younger guests will love!

The upstairs loft makes a great spot for playing games or catching up, with a comfortable sitting area and a dedicated game table set for checkers or chess. Leave your mark on the unique chalkboard wall, or settle into one of the little armchairs with a good book for a little alone time while the other guests socialize downstairs. There is also another HD flat screen with DVD in the loft.

This Mount Hood vacation rental home has one full bath with a shower/tub combo, and a mudroom with washer and dryer, making it easy to keep up with hiking clothes or ski gear. While there are neighbors nearby, the cabin is surrounded by pine trees so you'll be able to enjoy plenty of peace and quiet. Walk to the ZigZag River, or head up the mountain to access miles of hiking trails, mountain biking trails, fishing holes, and alpine lakes surrounded by wildflowers. In the winter, skiing and snowboarding is just ten miles away at Skibowl, with Timberline and Mt. Hood Meadows just a bit further on.

If you seek a cozy mountain getaway without compromising on comfort or convenience, look no further. The Sharp Cabin awaits your next Mt. Hood adventure!

The cabin is awesome.  Wonderful stay.  The shop with bball and table tennis is perfect.  The only thing I wish was different was more privacy. The neighbors behind the cabin are very close but the nice thing is it's another vacation rental so there's always a chance there won't be anyone there. All in all a great location and great cabin.

This home is so well set up for families. Basketball area was a major hit and floor plan layout lets you keep tabs on the kids while you cook/share a glass of wine in the kitchen.

Only downside is the one bathroom, but this home is so well kept you will love it!!

We enjoyed a comfy, relaxed weekend with our adult children to celebrate Christmas early.  The rain poured, and wind blew, but we had a great family time inside. We appreciated even finding Christmas themed placemats for us to use, along with plush towels, lots of kitchen/cooking/baking supplies, and a good load of firewood to keep the home fires burning.   (Unfortunately, lots of wind caused power flickers, which would turn off the oven [made meals a bit more of a challenge, dishwasher etc and made watching a Blu-ray movie together a bit frustrating.  The fire dept came late as a power line came down 50 yards down the street--  and the power company was replacing a pole as we left on Sunday).  We enjoyed fun in the sport room (hoops and ping pong) and wished the rain hadn't poured the WHOLE time, so we could have used the hot tub more easily.  [No way to keep anything dry (towels) when all was being drenched].  The bunk room is fine for adults if you move the top mattresses (more like foam pads) down to double up on the bottom beds.  Plan your shower schedule wisely or some will have cold ones in the one bathroom.  People with doggies would probably love the place - complete with dog bed and helps/reminders to be responsible pet owners.  Some previous visitors may not have read where animals should stay off furniture, beds?  We did find some kibble evidence from previous pet bringers, but overall, the place is very clean and welcoming.  We'd love to come again and stay longer, but would hope for less rain so we could better use the outside (hot tub) and check out the river trails.  Vacasa was helpful in accommodating our needs.

We had a wonderful time at the cabin, with our 3 boys. The hot tub was a great way to unwind. The only small thing was that the ground floor, the house smelled of dogs, since we do not have pets, it was a little strong. But overall great great place!

A great spot to get away and relax. It was so quiet and peaceful. The upstairs does get warm with the high temps we've been having, but the fans did help. Loved the neighbors golden retriever, he loved coming by to see our little dogs. The back deck was a great place to hangout in the evening to grill and have cocktails. Would love to spend a snowy winter weekend sometime.

We loved this place. Everything was super clean..which I appreciated. Everything you could think you would need is there.. all you need is food and paper products if you stay longer than a couple of nights. If you are parents whom are a bit on edge with a layout where you are upstairs, and the kids are downstairs, you may need to bring a door alarm. My husband and I were not comfortable with the layout. The front deck had two entries , and one of them was the kids bunk room. So, the kids stayed upstairs with us. If you have an autistic child, this place was great. Our son had so much to do and loved the hot tub and the upstairs. He was very content.

The cabin was warm and pleasant. The large kitchen made meal preparation delightful. The shop space was fun. The hot tub was relaxing. The outdoor surroundings were soul-filling.

We booked the Sharp Cabin for a weekend retreat at the mountain, hoping to get some skiing in! Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate with us. With consistent rain, we were held up in the cabin but still greatly enjoyed our time. The shop/game room was perfect for our three teenage boys to hang out and expend some energy and provided for some fun family competition. The board games and clean cozy house provided for the perfect afternoon relaxation.

I was a little concerned about sharing one bathroom with seven people but it ended up not being a big deal at all.

The house is beautiful and clean with updated appliances. The yard is good size but isn't fully fenced, just a note if you're bringing a dog.

Overall, I would highly suggest the Sharp Cabin, it exceeded our every expectation and was the perfect family get-a-way.

The cabin was roomy, homey, and comfy.  It had so many convenient amenities.  Furnishings and decorations were stylishly rustic.  Kitchen was modern and had plenty of dishes and utensils.  Loved the big screen TV.  My son enjoyed the video games on the upstairs TV.  The shop ping pong table and basketball court were also fun for our teenagers but there was a very mildewy smell in there.  Another bathroom would have been nice and with no air conditioning, we spent a couple of hot nights especially in the upstairs area.  Typically I understand that air conditioning is not an issue.

We mostly enjoyed our stay at the Sharp Cabin. The cabin is in a neighborhood of similar cabins close to a river with lots of fun little trails to walk. The house was well stocked and comfortable. The bikes and garage with ping pong and basketball were fun. The only downside were noisy neighbors that partied hard all night.

The cabin was tucked away in the woods, a short drive from civilization. You could hear the roaring river at night, and the birds chirping in the morning. The river is only a short walk away. Snow covered hills for hiking, sledding, or tubing only a short drive away. The cabin itself was amazing. The decor definitely set the atmosphere and the wood stove kept everyone nice and toasty (sometimes a little too toasty!). The shop with basketball and ping pong was a lot of fun too! We are planning another trip here!

I'd originally reserved a different house, but something went awry and Vacasa helped me find an alternate property and we ended up with this house for our weekend.  Everyone was delighted by the property!  The house is cute, comfortable, and clean.  The kitchen is wonderful to cook in, the beds very comfortable, and the place was quiet - although a neighbor's house alarm went off around 2 a.m. and continued through 10 a.m. the first night.

All in all, I would definitely look into renting this place again!

The Petersen cabin is fabulous for a party of our size -- two families with two kids each. Only inconvenience was having just one bathroom, on the first floor. Kids loved the video game system, board game selection, fun play spaces and fabulous bunk bed set-up, but DVD collection had just a few kid-friendly movies. House was extremely comfortable, secure, warm and relaxing. Loved the decor and appreciated all the small touches for our comfort!

Definately 5 stars for this cozy cabin!  Our family has enjoyed two Thanksgiving holidays there!  Dads took kids a short distance to snowboard, sled or tube while Mom's got Thanksgiving dinner ready.  Kitchen is user friendly and well stocked with neccesary appliances, dishes and utensils.  The living area is cozy and comfortable with warm, wood burning stove, large flat screen TV with DVD player for favorite movies.  Kids have their own "bunk room" set up for any age.  Two more bedrooms on second floor beckon with big fluffy beds to fall into after busy days of playing in the snow.  Summer activites include a walk to the Zig Zag River to fish or short drive to the nearby golf course for a round or two of golf.  Mt. Hood offers lots of summer activities, as well.  We came back to the cabin after a day of relaxing and playing and enjoyed a BBQ on the covered porch.  We love going to the Petersen Cabin and highly recommend it for a perfect "get-away".

This recently remodeled and modernly decorated three bedroom Brightwood vacation rental boasts amazing water views out on the back deck, a full kitchen for preparing meals, and a large upstairs suite, perfect for an afternoon of quiet reading, or for the kids to hang out and play.

The open floor plan is spacious, with gorgeous brand new hardwood floors, recessed lighting, new furniture (including a LazyBoy sleeper sofa), and colorful, Western-inspired floor rugs. There's a flat screen 37-inch TV with cable for spending a lazy evening in, surfing channels and watching your favorite shows.

In the full kitchen you can pop some popcorn, make a hearty breakfast before a day heading out to ski or hike, or create a full, home-cooked meal any evening. There's a large granite-topped kitchen island, so you'll have lots of work space for chopping vegetables or grating cheese, as well four stools, for extra dining spots right at this counter. And while there's no dishwasher, you can always let the pots and plates soak in the sink, while you head out to the deck to feed the ducks in the pond.

A modern-designed dining table right by the window is a nice space for morning coffee or to set up your laptop and use the WiFi. You may also want to spend a peaceful morning out on the deck, observing the peaceful pond views. There are also surrounding trails out to the duck ponds.

Downstairs, there are two bedrooms (as well as the full bathroom), making this Mt. Hood vacation rental perfect for anyone who wants to avoid stairs. The front bedroom is tastefully decorated with warm, clay-colored walls, comfortable bedding, and pops of color from the throw pillows. The master meanwhile, also has a queen bed, a wooden dresser, and French doors that lead out to the deck and duck ponds. Start the morning out here, watching the area wake up.

A final bedroom takes up the spacious second floor with a twin bed, as well as sofa. This space is bright and open, with lots of room for kids or pets to play. There's a coffee table or spreading out a board game or a puzzle, for some after-dinner games. This home will comfortably sleep up to seven guests (with a maximum occupancy of 10). Up to four pets can also join you on vacation here with a $10 per day, per dog fee ($40 minimum per stay).

This Pacific Trail vacation rental has a great location for discovering all that the Mt. Hood area has to offer. Newly remodeled with brand new furnishings and beds, your whole group will feel right at home here!

We planned our trip in early spring so we were not expecting the weather to be terribly accommodating but the view out the master bedroom & the area & hiking in general were beautiful & enjoyed by all. The duck ponds were very fun for the kids but quite deep & children who can't swim should be watched carefully around them at all times. We look forward to returning in warmer weather too!

Mountain views with activities for all

Nestled among the fairways of one of Oregon's most beautiful golf courses, this spacious three-bedroom condo is a perfect retreat for golfers, skiers, hikers, and spa-lovers alike!

Ideally located next to the lovely Resort at the Mountain on the western side of Mt. Hood, this condo offers the best of both worlds: easy access to the resort's golf, spas, and dining, along with all the peace, quiet, and cozy amenities of a private mountain getaway. When you are curled up by the wood-burning fireplace on a winter night or sipping your morning coffee in the patio's fresh mountain air, you'll know just what we mean.

Although cozy enough for just one couple or a small family getaway, the condo is also suitable for a larger group thanks to its flexible sleeping arrangements. Two of the three bedrooms each contain two sets of twin bunk beds, and the master bedroom offers both a luxurious queen bed and another set of twin bunks. There are two full bathrooms, making it comfortable for up to 8 guests!

The great room makes a wonderfully cozy pace for everyone in your group to gather, with a wood-burning fireplace, rustic touches like exposed timber beams, and plenty of comfortable seating (the sofa unfolds into a sleeper as well). The flat-screen TV offers cable and a DVD/Blu-Ray player, and two additional televisions in the bedrooms allow the kids to spread out if they can't agree on just one selection for movie night.

The fully-equipped kitchen has everything you need to prepare meals for your group. In addition to the usual refrigerator, oven, dishwasher, and microwave, you'll find cabinets fully stocked with plates, glassware, pots and pans, and cooking utensils, along with plenty of counter-top appliances to make cooking for a group easy (including a coffeemaker and grinder, blender, toaster, mixer, and slow cooker). The six-person table is positioned before a large picture window so you can enjoy the gorgeous views of the golf course and surrounding evergreens as you dine.

To get even closer to the great outdoors, head out the great room's sliding glass doors to the patio. There, you'll find a lovely four-person dining set and a gas grill for summer barbecues. You'll love breathing in the fresh mountain air and taking in the views, and there are even two extra loungers on the front patio for guests who like a little more peace and quiet as they curl up with a good book in the sunshine.

The condo is also well-suited for a working vacation or extended stay, with a washer/dryer and high-speed Internet access provided. Of course, all the amenities of Resort at the Mountain are just outside the Clear Hills complex; enjoy an early-morning tee time, then spend the afternoon at the resort spa, where your stay at the condo entitles you to a 20% discount. There are a few restaurants on-site, with a handful more in nearby Welches and dotted along Highway 26, and a very well-stocked Thriftway grocery store sits just around the corner.

In the winter, you'll find nearly endless skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing opportunities within thirty minutes of your front door (the closest ski resort being SkiBowl, just twenty minutes up the highway). At any time of year, the National Forest and wilderness areas offer amazing hikes, along with seasonal catch-and-release fishing on the Salmon River.

If you happening to be traveling with a larger group or would like even more space to spread out, consider booking this lovely getaway together with its neighbor, our Clear Creek Cabin!

My friends and I planned a snowshoe trip months ago, only to find that the weather did not cooperate for the weekend of our trip.  However, we still had a great time cooking, playing games, and looking at the really nice view from this rental.  I'm no golfer, but this was a reeeaaallly pretty golf course, with lovely mountains, walking paths, and a heron we nicknamed Terry.  Thanks for the relaxing vacation!

This place was just as clean and nice like the last time we stayed. Good restaurants an well stocked thrifthway, close to our place. My wife and I walked the pathway on the golf course, the time was limited because of the golfers, if it is possible to get more time for the renters to walk on the pathways, that will be nice.  One of the bathroom shower was not working just on the day we were leaving , we called the maintenance of the property, he came and fixed it. Our relative who stayed with us, liked this place very much especially, the view, and enough room and bunk bed for everybody.

Thank you

Power plug were too loose and heat tank is too small.

We arrived to a broken window (one pane shattered, inside was cracked) a large wooden box in the parking space by front door so unloading was difficult, and the unit was freezing no heat on at all. Baseboard heating which was fine day 2 takes along time to warm up, so would have thought some heat would have been left on for us, plus windows were wide open behind closed blinds we found several hours later. We wore hats, coats, and used blankets to hang out the first night and following morning. The bunk beds were descent to sleep on for the one short person in the group not meant for average adults, and the only bed in the unit was on the floor....common bed frames are $50 so really poorly furnished on that note for my friends 78 year old mother. The living room was lovely, laid out for comfort, and dining room, kitchen nicely stocked for real cooking...except refrig. We luckily brought a cooler for all the Thanksgiving food we were cooking including a large turkey, because the refrigerator is beyond old and did not cool below 45 degrees (and made lots of loud noises). I tested it with a refrig temp gauge I bought at the store, also the freezer never froze the ice we tried to make as well. If we had not noticed early on it would have been a disaster for perishable foods on this holiday given the date .... I put this towards it just happens sometimes, and with the holiday we moved on since no perishables stayed in the refrig long enough to be of concern.

The view from main hang out areas made it worth the stay this time, every morning views with coffee and all day we enjoyed them.... although I would not rent this unit again due to our issues & sleeping arrangements all bunk beds meant for kids not adults over 5'3...I would recommend it once you confirm these issues are handled especially the refrig ...for families who don't mind all sleeping in bunk beds & are shorter in height (only one double bed) for this lovely location/ setting to vacation at.

The lay out was spacious and good for families with kids, not for adults in the sleeping areas.

PS

I emailed that first night, and called the next morning and Vacasa did send their worker out who was nice on the same-day, but could not reach the owner to remove box at least before we left 4 days later, nor could he resolve heaters but 2 days time did that, so he brought us a bundle of wood with a smile. The window did not cause any issues in that room while we were there.

We were very glad to find that the property was so nice and close to all of the things that we were planning to do and see. We were surprised that there were 2 bedrooms with 2 sets of bunk beds in each and the third with one set. By the picture it looked like there were 2 pictures of the same room but happy to see that we could split up our kids a little bit more and give them and my husband and I a little more space. The home was very spacious. The only thing that we didn't figure out was how to use the garage but it wasn't that important to us. If it had been we would have called to ask. And since there is always someone to answer the phones with questions we knew we could have. Thank you for such an awesome weekend. We will definitely  be calling to rent again.

We were very pleased to have chosen Golfer's Condo. It was fully equipped just my favorite coffee was missing, so we left some for next guests:) WiFi is available and it works great. We visited Welches this February for ski, not golf, but there was no problem nor interruption staying at the Resort at the Mountain, a popular golf resort. There is a XC-ski rental shop right at the corner of the highway and the closest XC-ski trail, Trillium Lake Trailhead, is less than 20 minutes away. I recommend this place to groups and families.

Perfect location for us for spending time with grandchildren. The bunk beds were perfect for sleeping several people on week-end visits. Loved watching the golfers play through in beautiful Oregon weather, unusual for November I believe. All in all a wonderful experience.

Good value for the price.Wi-Fi was not available.

Pet-friendly apartment close to the river with room for 10!

At this newly remodeled four-bedroom Brightwood vacation rental, an immaculately refurbished unit what used to be a roadside motel, you'll have lovely river views, hardwood floors, warm designer colors, and brand new furnishings. And you don't even need to leave your pets at home - up to four dogs are welcome here with a $10 per day, per pet fee ($40 minimum per stay).

Relax on the beautiful leather sofa after a day of skiing at Timberline or an early morning fishing on the Sandy River. There's a wood stove for warmth and ambiance and plenty of space for your whole group to spread out, whether you're watching cable on the 51-inch flat screen TV, reading a book, using the WiFi, or playing a board game.

The dining room shares the living room's space, so socializing here is easy. The large table can be extended to accommodate up to 10, so there's a spot for everyone at meal times.

When it is time to prepare some food, the full kitchen has everything you'll need. A refrigerator, stovetop/oven, microwave - there's even a coffee grinder for freshly ground beans in the morning. Of course, you aren't limited to meals you cook yourself here. There's the Brightwood Tavern just across the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway, Wraptitude in nearby Welches, and local favorite The Rendezvous for innovative food and fun specials like "Wine Down Wednesdays."

From the deck, you'll be able to view the duck ponds and enjoy scenic water views. Come out here while the dishes are soaking to relax and finish your glass of wine. From the back, there are also a number of trails to head off and explore.

This Mt. Hood vacation rental is ideal for families that may have some members who want to avoid stairs. Three bedrooms are downstairs, and so is the one full bathroom. Two of these lower bedrooms have king sized beds (the purple room has also has views of the duck ponds), while the third bedroom is a bunk room with two sets of bunk beds.

Upstairs, you'll find a unique fourth bedroom with a queen bed, a dresser, and low ceilings. This Brightwood vacation getaway will sleep up to 10 guests (including eight adults).

Perfect for a year-round retreat for the whole family or couples traveling together with kids, this Hunchback Apartment offers a great Brightwood location, a brand new interior, and peaceful water views.

We greatly enjoyed our stay at the Hunchback Apartment.  The ponds were excellent, and the kids spent hours on the canoes. The house was very clean and fresh. We would consider staying here again.

If you're looking for a romantic getaway in this scenic Welches vacation rental, consider this luxurious studio looking out on the green, manicured fifth-tee of Resort at the Mountain's Foxglove Golf Course. Though it's perfect for golfers, the surrounding fairways are just the beginning of recreational opportunities and beauty you'll find all along the Mt. Hood Corridor.

Within walking distance of the meandering waters of the Sandy River, this elegant little nest has just enough room for you and that special someone.

This private studio echoes the opulence of the larger home of which it's a part, yet offers you amenities you'd expect from a bigger accommodation.

Have a seat in the comfortable chair and bring up the laptop with the free WiFi. Snuggle on the king bed in the glow of the propane fireplace. And don't forget to pack some DVDs to enjoy on those chilly nights. You'll also be able to watch the next episode of that cable show you just can't miss! Through the windows, you'll be treated to the tree-studded landscape of the golf course, and views of distant Mount Hood.

You have a kitchenette for tasty midnight snacks, or hot chocolate during the chilly nights. The coffeemaker so you can grab that much needed cup of Joe in the morning. For some serious eating, there are some fine eateries right in nearby Welches where you can satisfy just about any taste. In fact, you can take your honey for a romantic meal at the beautiful Altitude Restaurant (part of the Resort on the Mountain complex).

Before bed, relax in the steamy warmth of the (shared) sauna before bedtime. There are extra blankets if you're cold. Freshen up in the stylish, full bathroom.

This studio, and the larger home which is also available for bigger parties, are part of the Resort at the Mountain. There's two golf courses, a full-service spa, fitness center, croquet and lawn bowling court, sand volleyball and badminton courts, children's playground, and outdoor pool (enclosed and heated seasonally).

This beautiful home is located right near the Salmon/Huckleberry Wilderness where you can explore 31 miles of trails, including the popular, Salmon Creek Trail. Anglers can toss their lines in the nearby Sandy, or head over to the Salmon River. If you're coming in winter, Skibowl and Summit are about 15 minutes to the east. Mount Hood Meadows is about 45 minutes away.

Treat yourself to that romantic getaway this weekend in colorful and popular Welches. Bring, the clubs, the bike, the kayak, or the skis...whatever you call fun, to this elegant  Mt. Hood vacation rental right on the links, and close to all the fun things to do and see in the Mount Hood area!

I believe some of it was out of the control of Vacasa.  The noise from the main house below on our first night was highly unexpected and unpredictable.  I feel like the description makes the Studio room seem more secluded than it actually is.  It's really more a master suite inside a big house.  The hot tub is nice, but more a part of the main house.  It seems an intrusion to use it when there are main house occupants.  If we had a large party, I'd recommend renting the large main house.  That seemed very nice. I would not rent the studio space again.  The surrounding area is beautiful.

I would recommend for a quite and quick relaxing weekend!

The room was clean and the bedding was nice. The bathroom was clean too and the fixtures seemed new. The walls were recently painted, and the fridge, microwave, TV, and heaters were all good. There was no coffee provided with the coffee machine which was a little odd but not a big deal.

Unfortunately the "king" bed was two twin mattresses pushed together; they were not the same and neither of them was comfortable. The hot water had very low pressure and it took a long time to get hot water for a shower. The overhead fan in the bathroom has become detached from the ceiling but still worked.

The shades at the front window don't block the light from outside very well, which is a problem at night with the outside lights always on. There is also some noise from the highway because the motel is just off US26.

We found that our cell reception didn't work at all (T-Mobile). That's not the property's issue, but they did advertise that cell service worked fairly well. The wifi worked a few times but was unreliable and really slow. Not fast enough for netflix or even a youtube video. Very difficult to check email.

All in all it was not a bad place, but with the bed issue and the hot water issue, and no cell or internet, we would choose to stay somewhere else. If you are looking for a place to sleep and do nothing else, it's fine here.

In Rhododendron, settle in to this comfortable Tudor-style vacation home nestled in the foothills of Mt. Hood, tucked away in the little residential community of Timberline Rim. This three-bedroom vacation cabin is loaded with charm and character, and you'll feel right at home snuggling in front of the wood stove, sitting down to a hearty breakfast in the morning, relaxing in the hot tub in the backyard or chatting around the backyard table, surrounded by tall trees. Besides skiing, hiking, and biking in the area, you'll also have a garage game room with a small pool table, foosball, and a pinball machine.

Inside, the atmosphere is stylishly and comfortably rustic, with a beautiful wood beamed ceiling, cozy furniture, decorative pillows, and designer wall colors. There's a wood stove for warmth and ambiance and a TV with a DVD player for fun movie nights with friends or family. Of course, you may just want to spend a quiet afternoon on the sofa with a mug of hot tea and a good book, while the snow falls down outside.

The eat-in kitchen is large and open, with a farm-style, wooden table, shiny countertops, hardwood floors, and all the appliances needed for everything from gourmet meals to light snacks. There's even a coffee grinder for fresh beans every morning!

In the garage, you'll find a game room, a washer and dryer, and extra storage space if needed for skis, hiking equipment, or golf clubs. In the peaceful, fully fenced backyard with a hot tub, there's a gas grill for outdoor meals, and plenty of space for the kids or dogs to run around and play.

Back inside, all three bedrooms are located upstairs, along with a full bathroom - the half bath is conveniently located downstairs, near the kitchen. There's a bedroom with bright colors and a king sized bed, a queen room, and a bedroom with a twin-over-full bunk bed. All the bedrooms have comfortable bedding and nice accents. This home will comfortably sleep seven guests, as well as being pet-friendly for a $10 per dog, per day fee ($40 minimum per stay)!

The neighborhood of Timberline Rim includes a seasonal pool and a tennis court at the Timberline Ridge Recreation Club. Other summer activities near Rhododendron include bird watching, hiking, biking, fly fishing in the Sandy River, and rafting.

Come wintertime, this little town along the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway is close to a number of different ski resorts, making it an ideal destination for snow sports. Mt Hood Ski Bowl is 16 miles away and the famous Timberline Lodge is only a 35 minute drive from the  house. Plan the day there for world class skiing or snowboarding, followed by hot cocoa in front of the lodge's roaring fireplace.

In the surrounding National Forest lands, there are also multiple trails for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing. For a cozy mountain getaway and Mt. Hood winter (or summer) adventure, look no further than this charming vacation cabin!

We had a wonderful time staying at this home. We had two couples and two singles -- the house fit us perfectly.  We were a little disappointed that the pool table was quite small -- but other than that the house met and exceeded our expectations.  We weren't all on the same sleep schedule and the house's acoustics were good enough that the TV and conversation noise from downstairs didn't travel upstairs (to the master bedroom).  All in all we had a wonderful time and I would stay here again!

We were delighted with this property and will consider again.  The kitchen was well stocked to cook a large dinner. Plenty of dishes and glassware.  Great coffee mugs.     Our only note to self is to bring better knives as you can't expect a rental to provide good heavy knives for chopping etc.    The beds and linens were all exceptional!!!!   There is a great playroom with many kid friendly games for when it is raining - We had lots of rain.  The hot tub was also exceptionally comfortable and able to fit all 7 of us.  Great walking neighborhood and friendly neighbors.  I would recommend this property to any of our friends!

It was a peaceful cabin to stay in for a couple of nights. The back patio/yard was very private and serene. The house itself could use some minor updating (new sofa, working windows/screens, better electronics), but overall, clean and comfortable. The pool/community center is a short walk away, which was great! We'd stay here again.

The cabin was very clean and comfortable.  The only a couple of recommendations for things.  There weren't any matches or lighters to get the woodstove going,  we couldn't chop any wood with the tiny axes and the floor and counter tops were sticky

It could use some updating and repairs but was a fun place to stay.  We had our family with us and everyone had a good time

I recently moved to the Portland area and have been wanting to plan a weekend getaway to see Mt. Hood. I had planned on staying in Government Camp so the drive to the snow would not be so far but since there wasn't much snow on the ground it suited us just fine to stay a little further out.  The subdivision was easy to get to and the neighbors were all very nice.  The house was nicely appointed and had everything we could possibly  need.  There were 5 adults and one infant so the house was the perfect size. Having the half bath downstairs was helpful.  The house was clean, well stocked and cozy. The garage/game room was an additional bonus. The only issue we had was the hot tub (which was the "must have " amenity) smelled a little like mildew on the second night. Other than that we had a perfect family getaway and would definitely rent this property again.

The owners of this property clearly take pride in their property. It shows with all the upgrades they've done and how well they keep it stocked (furniture, toys, games, kitchen, etc.). Problem is, the maintenance and cleaning is lacking severely. We loved this cabin but probably won't rent from a Vacasa managed property again due to the disgusting hairball in the bathtub drain.

It was a nice house, but over priced.

We had a good time at this cabin. The kitchen was supplied with all necessary appliances. The house was clean. We played Wii, sat in the hot tub, and went on excursions to Mt. Hood. The local coffee shop (Coffee Brewsters) has some good coffee and pastries. We will be back for sure.

The house was just fine.  The kitchen was well-equipped.  The internet and TV were good.  Everything was very clean and tidy and we felt comfortable.  The transition cleaners and maintenance staff were so helpful.  The house is in a little sub-division in the woods with a shared pool and sauna.  There is shopping nearby.

We stayed here for a girls retreat and were happy with the cabin and area.  Everything was clean and orderly - we had everything we needed!  The hot tub was relaxing once we got it to the right temperature.  At checkout, we appreciated not having to launder all the bedding - that takes so long when you are packing up to leave.  We did, however, start the laundry of towels for the cleaning person. :)

We had a wonderful mountain get away for Mother's Day.  Although it rained the whole time, the house was cozy and had everything we needed to entertain ourselves.  The hot tub is amazing and plenty of games to enjoy for hours.  We didn't even touch the garage game room.  All adults this trip.  We will bring the kids next go around and maybe schedule out in late summer, early fall.  I have rented several vacation homes and I really appreciated the cleanliness and hotel feel this house had with towels and toiletries, but the hominess of the dÃ©cor and furnishings.

We had a great stay at the Marshall's Cabin. It was comfortable and cozy but still roomy enough for our family of 4 (parents and teenage boys) and 2 dogs. We will definitely be making future reservations!

My boyfriend, his children (8 & 11), myself, and my children (17 & 18) had a great time. The cabin has plenty of space, videos, and games (including a game room) for all of us to enjoy. We spent each day either at Timberline or Ski Bowl and enjoyed coming back to soak in the hot tub, cook dinner in the nice-sized kitchen, and then relax with a board game or a movie.

We highly recommend it for its location, price, and amenities. We are considering booking it again for later this year.

This four bedroom vacation home has everything you could dream of for a special mountain getaway - a tree and fern filled landscape, cozy wood stove, a scenic, fast-running river right out back, and plenty of easy-going character. And if there are any golfers in your group, Welches is the place for a truly memorable trip, as the very first Oregon golf course is less than a mile away!

Hidden back among the trees, surrounded by blooming foxglove and a bubbling pond, this home makes quite an impression upon arrival. Inside, you'll be greeted with a lovely sunken living room with tall ceilings, mountain cabin decor, lots of windows, and colorful nature-themed art hanging on the walls. It will be easy to find a comfortable spot to relax in this very family-friendly interior! Just sit back, put your feet up, and enjoy the warmth of a wood stove fire. Aside from reading a good book while you relax, there's also a TV with DVD player and VCR, plus some DVDs and VHS movies to pick from. On chilly evenings you can gather everyone around for a movie night or a board game.

The dining room and kitchen are open and bright with dining room table seating for eight. The breakfast bar holds three extra stools and is great for quick snacks or just reading the morning paper with a cup of coffee. In addition to all the major appliances you'd expect, there's also a toaster oven, microwave, coffee grinder, and tea kettle. Also plenty of dishes, glasses, and silverware. Breakfasts like banana nut pancakes or chive scrambled eggs and bacon will be a joy to whip up in this clean, well-appointed space.

Right near the dining room is access to the amazing outdoor deck. Take in the mountain landscape from this peaceful oasis. In the yard, an outdoor fire pit is all ready for ambiance or making s'mores after dinner. The hot tub is located on the back deck for your enjoyment as you listen to the sounds of the Sandy. The deck looks out over a large yard that will be fully enclosed if the gate is closed after arriving. Stairs from the deck lead down to the rushing Sandy River (more for memorable photographs than swimming, this part of the river has very fast currents!).

Back inside on the main level, the master bedroom has its own deck access, a queen sized bed, and an eclectic, relaxing design. Since this is the only bedroom on this level, it's peaceful and private. Right through the sliding glass door is a vista of trees, loads of fresh mountain air, and a hammock to lounge away the day in. This room also has an attached bath with a shower.

The remaining three bedrooms are located upstairs. One bedroom has two twin beds, a TV, and deck access for a view down over the hot tub. A nearby kid's game room has a twin-sized pull out sofa, love seat, a TV and a little mini-pool table. Lots of games are also available, so the little ones always have fun activities to keep them occupied.

Another bedroom down the hall features a queen bed. The final bedroom has lovely, framed Oregon travel prints, deck access, a TV, and more eclectic, mountain style. This four-bedroom home will comfortable sleep 10 guests. Additionally, dogs are welcomed here! Bring your four legged friends for a $10 per pet, per day fee ($40 minimum per stay). Other amenities include a stereo with CD player, washer and dryer, and WiFi.

Like all towns near Mt. Hood, Welches offers many cold weather activities as well, be it a sleigh ride around snowy downtown or just enjoying a cup of hot cocoa back at your cabin. Nearby Mt. Hood Ski Bowl is about 15 minutes away and Timberline is only a 25 minute drive east. National Forest lands surround the home, so there are also plenty of opportunities for cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling.

In summer, Oregon's First Golf Resort is right at the Resort at The Mountain. It's only a mere mile away! The Courses offers challenging golf in lovely environs. In addition there's a spa with all kinds of amenities.  Also nearby, cyclists can choose from over 40 bike routes around town, and there are 30 trails for hiking in the Salmon-Huckleberry Wildnerness Area.

Dining options are plentiful along US Route 26 - everything from fine dining at The Rendezvous to pizza and beer at Mogul Mountain Pizza (they deliver too)! The local Thriftway grocery is just half a mile away, so it's always easy to grab a few last-minute ingredients for dinner. Whether you stay in this wonderful mountain home for golfing, skiing, or if you just end up spending your time on the amazing deck listening to the Sandy River, you'll love this Mt. Hood getaway!

My wife and I, along with two other couples stayed here for three nights over Memorial Day Weekend.  It was a fantastic getaway!  Plenty of room for everyone.  The outdoor patio was very nice as well as the grill and hot tub.

Thanks for a great time!

The house was very clean, cozy and had all the amenities that we wanted! The hot tub on the back porch was awesome. Having the gas grille and firewood provided made the experience even better - we really appreciated that! From what I have seen this property is one of the best values in the area. One thing that the pictures don't do justice is that the floor plan is VERY open, which is exactly what we wanted since we were a bigger group. Very conducive to spending time together.

Enjoyed a wonderful spring retreat at Sandy River Retreat House. The location was private and the home very comfortable. We will be back!

The house is in a lovely spot . The property seemed a little tired. Could use some updates. The staff were helpful in correcting what they could . It would have been better it these things had been taken care before our arrival. Recommend with reservations

This is the second year I've rented this place for my grown kids and their spouses.  We were a little disappointed this year because the snow just wasn't there, but we found a couple of hikes to go on and that was just as good.  The days were sunny and warm for January and that made the hikes beautiful and fun.  I'd recommend staying here to anyone looking for a peaceful, relaxing vacation.

Lovely property with excellent outdoor space.  The deck is huge with a BBQ, hot tub and fire pit. We spent every evening outside for hours enjoying the river and the stars from the deck.  The home was spacious and clean.  Close to hiking and kayaking on various lakes. Would absolutely go back!

We were a family of 8 adults and one dog and tremendously enjoyed the location of this spacious and beautiful house.  The setting is gorgeous and very private at the dead end road.  The Sandy River is beautiful and we loved the roaring water sound at night.  The river is not suitable for children, though, in fact it became quite dangerous after a rain!  I would not want to have to watch young children on this property,  we kept the dog tied up on the deck when we sat out there.  It sleeps 8 adult couples privately.  If you have more in your party, you can find beds, it just depends how you want to divide them up.  Some furnishings need upgrading, and don't count on the hot tub being sanitary!  Maybe they could also have an additional coffee pot handy.  Some people (me) can't have caffein but love their coffee.  An extra French press would do.  But the location is handy for grocery shopping and even a coffee shop and a gas station, all very welcome in the "wilderness".  Access to hikes and day trips is perfect.  Altogether we had a grand time staying at this gorgeous place.

The home and setting on the river was very nice. the deck was very spacious and the hot tub was very easy to use.  The gas grill was in good condition and quite clean. we stayed for 2 nights and had a party of 9. worked very well.  even our little westie loved it. Had fun finding friendly frogs in the pond. We would stay again.

We stayed here with friends, all of whom had kids aged newborn - 4 years and had a great time.   The property met our expectations and we were within a 20-30 minute drive of Timberline and Mt. Hood hiking.  We did all of our meals at the house, and enjoyed the grill on the deck, though there are plenty of dining options close by.   We enjoyed evening fires and hot tub time on the deck in the evenings.   The only warning for families with young kids is that the Sandy river is close by and you have to really monitor young kids when outside.  However, we didn't find it to be a problem - just something to be aware of!   We'll definitely keep this property in mind for future trips with friends.

We loved the nearby hiking trails. Zigzag falls easy, gorgeous 1/2 mile hike, Frustration falls on the Salmon river was incredible for the more experienced hikers.

The kids loved the Ski Bowl Adventure Park, with Alpine slides and Indy cars.

Everybody caught a fish at Clear lake, even had few good keepers.

Great location, secluded on the Sandy river while just a minute away from a grocery store and a gas station.

It rained a couple days while we were there, no problem, packed up the kids and took them to the sunny side of the mountain, 15 min away.

This was a great place for  a family gathering.  Lots of sleeping space, great private deck overlooking the river.  Highly recommended.

This house was comfortable for 5 adults and 2 children .  We enjoyed the views and the sound of the  rushing river.  You do have to watch children closely outside though, as there is a large pond in the front yard and the river is not  fenced off in the back yard.  We will consider renting this house again (especially if the owners were to re-arrange the furniture so the upper balcony room has the queen bed instead of the twin beds!).

We stayed at this house with another family.  All together we were 9 people and a dog. The yard and deck were excellent and the deck has one of the nicer hot tubs at a house rental that I've experienced.  The inside is not modern or very updated but very clean and lots of beds.  The main down side to this house that that the water smells like iron and so we drank and cooked with bottled water that we brought.  Our dog loved the yard.

My significant other and I, along with my three grown kids and their spouses stayed for three nights!  The area is beautiful with plenty of things to do around there if you love the snow! We had a great time and will definitely go back.

A group of friends and I did a writing retreat here. Overall the location and house were beautiful. The house is large enough to accommodate lots of people without feeling crammed(we ended up with 5 people but could have easily had a couple more. There was a whole bedroom we didn't even use). Stellar views, secluded feeling while being close to things, felt very safe and peaceful. The hot tub was a nice way to relax on the cold nights. Definitely bring bottled water as suggested if you come because the tap water has a metallic taste (there's a grocery store conveniently located a couple minutes drive away if you forget to though).

My husband and I have five beautiful grown children who in most part each have started families of their own. It is hard now to get all of them together since each have started their families in different locations.  Mt Hood is a perfect central location for us all to meet.  In choosing a family friendly environment Vacasa Rentals helped in all aspects of this Very Important event we strive to have each year.  Our children were extremely happy with our choice.  We were extremely happy with not only the location, but the warmth and friendliness of this staff.  When we finished with our weekend we felt a sense of family unity amongst ourselves that we will cherish for a lifetime and will choose to make this our New Family Tradition Location for Many years to come.  Thanks Vacasa!

We had a wonderful stay! Everyone was so helpful, and the entire process was effortless.  Thank you!  The only recommendation I have is to leave a detailed binder of directions in the rental unit.  We were't sure what the rules are for little things, like washing linens/towels/dishes etc.  I would love to stay again, perhaps as a summer trip.

This home was beautiful and located such that you could enjoy seeing the river. Big deck for sitting outdoors.

Beautiful home hidden at the end of a quiet drive, right at the river's edge. Furniture and fixtures could use updating, but the house was clean and comfortable.

The house is very cozy and spacious for the entire family. The location is perfect for the absolute get-away from city life and noise. The constant babble of the river was very comforting, and the spectacular morning show of the hawks looking for breakfast on the river was better than any television nature show! The house is close enough for shopping, but far enough away to lose yourself in nature.

From the minute we picked up the phone to inquire on a short vacation rental, we received superior customer service from Vacasa. In fact, that first phone call was made at nearly 8:00 pm, and we didn't even really think someone would be there to respond, but Kim was there to take the call and take our reservation. Then, the place we originally booked had a small maintenance problem, so an agent called and helped us find an alternative place, which turned out to be the Sandy River Retreat. What a beautiful home! It is large, private, and located right on the Sandy River. There is a LARGE deck with a hot tub, fire pit, bbq, and seating for 4-6 people. There are 4 bedrooms: 1 mstr suite, 2 rooms with queen/full size beds, and 1 room with 2 twin beds. The living area is large and comfy to hang out in. The kitchen has virtually EVERYTHING you could possibly need to cook meals and feed your crew. We loved this place, and hope to plan a return visit some time in the future.

Hear the wonderful sound of Clear Creek from the deck of this classic, A-frame vacation rental cabin. Recently remodeled, this circa 1957 cabin is just 1.5 miles from Mount Hood Highway. You'll enjoy the quiet, unhurried atmosphere of this cozy mountain hideaway on Clear Creek with amenities like DVD/VCR/Stereo/CD Player, with 6.1 surround sound and cable TV. Located about five minutes north of scenic Rhododendron, you'll savor the tranquility of this cozy mountain hideaway on Clear Creek, providing a timeless, relaxing escape on about one acre in the forest.

Ensconced in the warmth of the Vermont Casting wood stove, the wood-paneled, cozy living room on the main floor has a queen sofa and opens to grand views of the creek below, providing the perfect compliment to the tranquil atmosphere. Catch those re-runs of Lucy and Desi on the cable TV on both floors, or enjoy the DVD/VCR/Stereo/CD Player, with 6.1 surround sound. Bathed in light from 10 dormers and big, stylized windows, the upper level has a sitting room - with breathtaking panoramic views of Clear Creek - that you won't want to leave. Like previous guests, you can play music here, do artwork, relax, watch TV, read and more. Sink into one of the two soft sofas. There are antiques (for example, an old sled converted into a coffee table) and a writing desk by the window where you can pen a letter or commune with your muse while you watch the rushing waters below.

The kitchen of this classic vacation rental is literally a work of art. With custom tile work by Enna Tiles, a local Mt. Hood artist, your chef will have the rare combination of aesthetic and functional value. With ample room for cook and helpers, the unique tiled island houses the electric range and affords you the extra space for extra dishes. There's a microwave and coffeemaker as well. Clean ups will be easy with the dishwasher.For marshmallows and s'mores, head creekside to the stone benches and fire pit. Serve it all up at the table for six (two more at the bar), or gather 'round the table on the deck and have your meal above the roar of the creek.

Bedrooms are upstairs. In both, your bed will be the base of the triangle formed by the A-frame roof, with big, custom triangular windows inviting in the morning sun. The Master Bedroom features a queen bed and a bath and the second bedroom has a twin bed and a full bed. The bathroom on the main floor is a veritable spa. With two sinks, a two-person Jacuzzi tub and a dual head shower, this is not your average bathroom. You can also enjoy a romantic and relaxing view of Clear Creek from the deck.

As part of the Mount Hood Scenic Byway, Rhododendron is a great jumping off point for all the activities, summer or winter, available around Mount Hood. Close to five ski areas (including Mount Hood Meadows, a little over a half-hour away). There are great places to fish and hike as well with nature paths around the property that run by Clear Creek.

We enjoyed everything about our stay. Quiet, comfortable, close to Mt Hood and Columbia Gorge. Absolutely no problems.

I loved everything about my stay, the cabain  was just amazing, we didn't want to leave

There's nothing I didn't like, Highly recommend to my friends!

We had an excellent time at your cabin. In fact, none of us wanted to leave. The location couldn't have been more perfect as it was centrally located to just about everything we wanted to do during our vacation. The house is beautiful, don't change a thing. We will be back!!!!!

The house was as described. The location was convenient to Welches for groceries and dining options and the national forest for hiking. It was clean and comfortable. I inferred there wouldn't be wifi available when I booked this cabin and planned to use the hotspot on my cell phone to access internet for our devices but there was no cell service in the house. If you want to totally disconnect this property is a great option.

We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful cabin. We hope to come back and visit again!

Fantastic rural location ultra close to everything you need. The cabin was well appointed with linens and towels and great decor! We cooked many of our meals at home, and enjoyed the fire riverside. There was no wifi which was a nice chance to unplug, but a nice TV and DVD player. Toys for our little boy and plenty of space for us. Would definitely visit again!

We loved this house!  The location is private, with lush vegetation around this beautiful house.  The view of the creek from the house is breath-taking.  The fire pit sits down a short path alongside the creek and is perfect.  The kitchen is spacious and a joy to cook in.  Everything I needed to cook our meals was there.  The house is decorated with lovely antiques.  We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a clean, beautiful, charming, rental in a perfect location for visiting Mt. Hood.

the cabin is laid out for a large group. everyone has thier own space. no one is on top of anyone. the cabin has all the creature comforts of home with a firepit river side, beautiful!

My girlfriend and I stayed at the Clear Creek Cabin for the long President's Day weekend. This was our home base for skiing at Mt. Hood Meadows - about a half hour drive east of the cabin.

The cabin was great - very homey feel but with modern amenities such as new dishwasher, washer and dryer, plasma TV, keyless locks, jacuzzi tub, etc. The cabin didn't seem too huge for two of us, yet I could also see 6-8 people staying there comfortably. Plenty of dishes, cookware, linens, and everything else we needed during our stay. Very clean, warm, and easy to manage. We will definitely look into staying there again should we return to Mt. Hood. Highly recommended.

The property was great. Very sweet and cozy! Great and easy location,. Can't wait to return

This was our first visit to Mt. Hood and we all loved the Clear Creek cabin.  The cabin is small and quaint with a great layout for a small family - small living space upstairs, living room downstairs and a large deck.  We loved the closeness to the creek - so quiet and peaceful.  Close to grocery and restaurants as well as local hikes.

The cabin was amazing -- everything I had hoped for and a wonderful place to celebrate my birthday with friends.  Absolutely beautiful, peaceful setting by the creek, so thoughtfully laid out and beautifully decorated with oodles of rustic charm. Obviously well-maintained and cared for and stocked with plenty of everything that you need for your comfort.  Loved sitting in the comfy, cozy living room in front of the fire in the woodstove, the beautiful upstairs living area with view of the creek, the proximity to hiking trails, the fabulous jacuzzi tub to soak those sore muscles in after hiking,  the very comfortable bed in the master bedroom, and the kitchen with ample space to cook in. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I, for one, hope to be back to enjoy it in other seasons as well.

The house was amazing, it has such a great feel and was stocked with everything you could possibly need and that bathtub was awesome. I look forward to going back again. Thank you!

It was very relaxing, the cabin had a great aura about it and you just felt like you were home!! Very positive energy, it is a very beautiful home!!

Will for sure want to come and stay again. Already thinking about it:-)

Wished that they had cleaned the fire pit out and put the cover on it so it wasnt full of water and wood and ashes from the previous renters other then that really liked it.

It would have been helpful to have a binder with the rules and check-out info so that we didn't have to call.  We thought you could get cell coverage which you can't.  Would be helpful to know that.  You are close to the neighbor on one side who have dogs so if you have small children playing outside I could see them barking a lot.  Other then that the place was very nice and cozy for our holiday weekend!

The sunny living room has a gas fireplace, cozy, plush furniture, and decorative accents like candles and throw pillows. Sit back and watch a Blu-ray DVD on the large wall-mounted flat screen TV, or just channel surf the cable. You don't even need to remember to bring your favorite movies from home - there's an extensive DVD collection right here to peruse.

From the sofa, you'll have a gorgeous lake scene out the windows, but on nice days, head to the deck for an even better view. Enjoy a summer barbecue overlooking Collins Lake, surrounded by trees and fresh mountain air. This may also become your favorite spot to enjoy your morning coffee or a before-bed glass of port.

The wooden dining table will seat six whether it's a a home-cooked meal or take-out pizza. And in the spacious full kitchen, you'll have high-end stainless steel appliances and ample counter space for your culinary creations. If you need more seating, there's a breakfast bar right at the counter.

Here, a master suite has a four-poster queen bed, TV, and an en suite bathroom with a shower/tub combo. The other bedroom also has a queen bed, and in the loft there are two twin beds, as well as another TV - perfect for kids to watch cartoons. Here, you'll also have your own washer and dryer so there's no need to overpack.

The amenities at this Mt. Hood vacation rental include access to the wonderful community Creekside Lodge. here you'll have two hot tubs, a sauna, and a beautiful year-round outdoor pool. The clubhouse has free WiFi (as does your very own condo), as well as a stunning ski lodge decor. Have a drink in front of the large stone fireplace before you head to the tubs for a relaxing soak under the stars.

Of course, one of the main winter attractions to this region of Oregon is skiing, and here you'll be only minutes from three major ski resorts. Mt. Hood Skibowl, Timberline, and Mt. Hood Meadows are all under 11 miles away, Skibowl being the closest at a quick three minute drive. Also right nearby you can strap on snowshoes or don your cross-country skis and explore the area on foot.

In nice weather, this area has ample hiking, biking, fishing, kayaking, and golfing opportunities, making this a truly year-round destination! At just over an hour's drive from Portland, this Collins Lake vacation condo is close enough for a weekend getaway but special enough to make it a special vacation destination.

This townhouse had everything we needed for our family of six. We stayed during Labor Day weekend for our last hurrah before school started. It was very clean and comfortable. The clubhouse pool and hot tub were a favorite with the kiddos.  I would highly recommend the mile high ski lift at Timberline during the summer.

For once a condo stocked well enough with pots pans etc, I could could cook and BBQ a wonderful couple of dinners, cause in Government Camp, not much good to choose from if you want healthy and good for a meal if you eat out.

This condo has it all and in such a fantastic setting. I would highly recommend it

This home overlooks the lake (more of a pond, really).  The views out the back are incredible; it probably has the best view of any units at Collins Lake.

The home was more than well equipped for a rental.  We found nothing lacking in the kitchen, linens, towels all were great. The only negative comment from one of the party was the  master bedroom mattress was like sleeping in a trough and she woke up every time she needed to turn. A new mattress  may make this a five star

The only other detriment and not something that can be changed was the highway noise even in the middle of the night.  Oh and seeing as we were a group  of women DVD supply was in great supply but looked as though main occupants are fathers with children however we did find movies to watch. And with ability to sign into our own Netflix account that was easily solved. All in all a wonderful stay and we all said we would be back as a group or with our own families. And would definitely recommend Collins Lake Resort to friends

Mountain paradise with all the conveniences of home

Everyone in your group will be charmed by the stylish decor and wowed by this vacation home's perfect wooded location.

Whether you finish the day in front of a roaring fire sipping mugs of hot cocoa or with a relaxing soak in the outdoor hot tub, this Mt. Hood cabin will make you feel right at home. In the living room, beneath the decorative iron chandelier, you can also settle back for a DVD on the flat screen TV (there's basic cable as well).

Although there are plenty of restaurants nearby, you won't mind eating in here at all! The cozy dining area sits in front of a charming cast iron wood stove and the kitchen is a well-laid out, stylish space with stainless steel appliances and a tiled counter. Skylights let in lots of natural light while you chop vegetables or stir sauces. And if you need extra seating, the counter doubles as an attractive breakfast bar.

This beautiful home has a lot of space to find a quiet spot. A small sitting room near the kitchen has another TV and some comfortable furniture. Perfect for an afternoon of reading and sipping an Oregon pinot noir. This room also has access to a loft - a great spot for kids to nap or play.

The master bedroom has a queen bed, and outdoor access through sliding doors with a picturesque view of the tree-filled yard. Another bedroom has a queen bed, and the final room has an elegant layout with a twin sized bed. Two bathrooms are located throughout the home for easy sharing.

THIS PROPERTY IS GREAT VERY WELL MAINTAINED AND EXTREMELY COMFY BED

We stayed at Foxglove Falls for our third stay and were pleased again. The addition of the hot tub since our last visit really was a treat.  The house is well supplied and we have a great time with our family.

The main bed has a sponge type mattress which takes some getting used to but it's an improvement from the bed that used to be in there.  Lovely stay with beautiful surroundings. Thank you!!

This home is furnished so beautifully! Very comfortable. Nice lot. Really missed the ping pong table! Wish we had known ahead of time that it wasn't in the home.

This home has a nice location. It's close to the road- but so quiet that we noticed no traffic. It's woodsy with nice views outside every window. The layout is nice- there is great space in the living room with a roaring fireplace, and more hangout space in the kitchen/dining area.

My only insight for future guests is that although it technically sleeps 9- it's kind of a funky set-up. Despite having four bedrooms- it really didn't work for our party of three couples. Two bedrooms have nice double beds, which comfortably slept two couples. One bedroom has only a twin bed (and three skylights- which are beautiful, but made it impossible to sleep in due to all the light). The fourth bedroom has a pullout sofa, and a loft with two unfolding futon-style cushions that can sleep one each (although I am 5'5" and my feet hung off the end). So- for three couples, it did not really work, unless somebody was willing to sleep on the pullout. We ended up using an air mattress in the loft. I think it would be great for two couples and their kids, or two couples and two singles, etc.

First of all, Vacasa made my experience so easy. We had originally booked the wrong rental, so I called for help. My call was answered quickly and the agent was able to move my funds over to this property and simply charge me the difference. Very simple.

As for the property, it's just beautiful. The location is perfect and the house is just gorgeous. We had a wonderful time while we were there. Definitely recommended.

Although other homes around it's so covered in beautiful trees and plants you don't hear nor see anybody around.  The road is right in front but up high enough to not even notice and it's so quiet at night.  Loved the fire pit and the cool evening air!  Wish we could've spent a week or two there, it's THAT comfy!

A great place to stay. Very peaceful and nicely quiet. A great place to relax and unwind.

We liked the general store at the junction of Hwy26 and E. Welches. It was well stocked with great variety at good prices. The staff were friendly too.

We recommend the waterfalls section of Hwy 30 scenic route. If you're in to hiking the 5 mile loop between Wahkeena Falls and Multnomah Falls climbs 1600 feet over a shoulder. You get to see some of the less well known sections of the falls.

Shopping at Washington Square Mall is worthwhile (Hwy 217 west of Portland).

We also took the opportunity to go white water rafting at White Salmon River (Washington side of the river) with Wet Planet. Great fun especially on hot days, the proximity to the water keeps you cool, as does the splashing, the falling in, and at one point the opportunity to jump from a bridge...

I Loved the way this trip turned out. All of the group had a blast taking hikes to waterfalls, enjoying delicious food, and checking out the nightlife of the city. The property was more beautiful then I imagined and had lots of fun amenities to keep us busy in between adventures. I had a great 1st trip to Oregon and a lot of it had to do with the comfort of foxfalls.

Our group of 5 adults and 1 puppy loved this space! Being only an hour from Portland made this a great place to get away from the city without feeling like we spent half our weekend driving.  The house is in a neighborhood, but at the end of the street with a large lot so it actually felt fairly secluded.  We thought the house was better in person than it showed in the photos, which is always a pleasant surprise.  We never did get a roaring fire going in the outdoor fire pit, or have that ping pong tournament we kept talking about - which just means we'll have to come back.  The management company was very attentive and helpful when the cable went out right before the Blazer playoff game.  (It turned out the cable was out in the area, but it was quickly restored.) The only thing we could recommend is a note to warn guests that the refrigerator/freezer beeps when the door isn't shut properly.  It took us several minutes to track down the location of the alarm.  Overall: nice location, nice layout, attentive staff.  We'll be back.

Really enjoyed our stay in this spacious, beautiful home. Coming back after a day of riding to make a fire and soak in the hot tub made it all the better... Thank you!

Such a lovely property, lots of room for both of our families. And just a hop to the ski bowl!

Nicely done rental, vacation rental company needs to be more on top of cleaning between turns, house was not ready by check-in time. We would go back.

The house was very accommodating for two families with kids. There was plenty of room to spread out and the kids enjoyed the side room with its own game monitor and loft. The ping pong table was also a big hit. We didn't have any snow when we went, so it was great to have fun options right at the house to keep everyone happy. The Kitchen was well equipped in terms of cookware and tools. The beds were comfortable with nice linens. Our only small complaint was that the satellite TV and wifi were not always strong, so at times the TV would freeze and our devices would not always load. Otherwise, a beautiful house.

Very comfortable place for a family or group of friends to stay.  We really appreciated the large living room with plenty of room to sit in front of fire, read, play games, etc.  Very close to store, golf course, restaurants but also very quiet.  We would return!

We really enjoyed our staying in this house! It is beautiful and clean inside. We played games and ping pong. It was very very clean everywhere. Kids are begging to go back. Lots of lights, decorations, complimentary shampoo, conditioner (normal big size! :) ), it has lots of sleeping space! As I wrote before, the only thing to add is extra bedding for the kids in case of accidents. I thought one of the sheets was dirty, so decided to wash it just in case, but then realized that there is no extra sheet, so had to give the queen sheet for my little once and then to sleep on a small one after it dried. Otherwise it was great there!

Myself and a group of friends came to stay up for a weekend-away. We were hoping to have a place comfortable and be near hiking trails.

While this definitely wasn't a _secluded_ location, it felt very personal and secluded because of how beautiful the property was. In addition, it was easily located near HWY 26 to get up to Timberline Lodge and around Mt. Hood.

The property was well-maintained, the amenities and furnishing excellent, and we had a great time! Our only problem was that the internet was finicky, and we had some issue with it the couple of times we wanted to use it.

My only negative experience was the reservation process. I reserved the space online, but did not realize that there was a follow-up process for confirming the reservation. When I missed that call and called back, it was frustrating to confirm over the phone (since I didn't have a reservation number b/c you weren't given one until after you confirmed the reservation). So forewarning - expect a call right after submitting your booking!

I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Mt. Hood while still having a comfortable, easy-to-reach place at the bottom of the mountain. Enjoy!

This is a gorgeous house with lots of space and nice details. It was very comfortable, lovely to sit on the front deck for breakfast or at night to watch the stars. Beautiful views out the windows. - -  It is truly like the pictures in the listing. We had been looking for something even more secluded but everything was booked because of a holiday weekend.  In the end, this was great pick for us, as it is on a large lot, and the outside fire pit, picnic table and large surrounding trees make you feel like you are in your own little piece of wilderness.   Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us!

Great place. Would definitely visit again.

Beautiful location in the woods with a fire pit, plenty of outdoor furniture to enjoy sitting outside.  Beautiful landscaping.  Inside the house was decorated very nice and was open and comfortable for many people.

Less than motel 6 quality pillows and bed linens. Nice  apartment but esperately in need of kitchen maintenance....look elsewhere

Rid the smell and get AC..then Perfect!

As far as cleanliness goes the place needs a good scrubbin & a nice shampoo to get rid of dog smell & a few minor set backs (toilets & hot water) other tha  that it is a very nice place to stay. Perfect location near the back, yet still close to the pool.

this was our first time to Mt.Hood and stay with with a vacasa rental. our children had a blast! our rental was super cozy and family friendly! it felt like home away from home! the only thing I'll bring next time is a baby gate as I have a lil walker that like to explore! other than that best place to stay!

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the booking and check in process was easy!

Thanks for providing a pet friendly unit.  It's why we chose your place and will definitely be back again!  Thank you!

Unit was in great condition and very well stocked with everything cooking, as well as games and movies for both adults and kids. Gas grill was also a plus. Would definitely stay here again - great quick getaway to cool, clean mountain air.

Had a very pleasant stay at the Collins Lake Condo X-112.  The unit was immaculate, quiet and convenient to all points of interest.

Great place, but call ahead for pool conditions if that is an important part of your stay.

We had a great time at the resort!! Such a nice and beautiful place!! The house was so clean, neat and comfy. We did not want to leave. There was enough room for us and our 3 small dogs. Love the near by trails to be able to walk the dogs. We would for sure come back. Thanks so much for sharing your home.

I recommend putting a femine product dispenser in the clubhouse. I had to drive to rodenendran because none of the places open at midnight had any.

We loved the condo, it was clean and it a great location! We were able to walk to ratskeller and other places! The condo is actually bigger than what I expected and we all slept comfortably even our dogs=) I will be back to stay in this unit and highly recommend it and Vacas rentals to anybody. They were very helpful, there office is open late wich is very nice!

Really enjoyed staying at Collins Lake 112.  This is a beautiful and well kept chalet with all the amenities needed, and then some, after a long day on the mountain.  No complaints, truly had a great stay and would recommend it highly!

This light and cheery studio Brightwood vacation rental has been newly remodeled with an all new interior. Part of a 17-unit complex, this spacious studio room has all the comforts of an upscale hotel room. Plus, it's pet friendly, so there's no need to leave the dogs behind when you go on a Mt. Hood adventure!

Featuring a snuggly king-sized bed with a brand new pillow-top mattress, after a long day of skiing or hiking, you'll look forward to sinking into this bed for a little TV watching or reading. The flat screen TV includes cable and is easy to see right from the bed or two-person table.

You'll have a small refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker and a coffee grinder, so you can easily heat up leftovers from the previous night's meal out or prepare a simple breakfast. Nearby dining choices include the Brightwood Tavern, Altitude at The Resort at the Mountain, or pick up some wild boar tacos at El Burro Loco in nearby Welches for a cozy dinner back at your Mt.

This cozy Welches vacation rental is a fabulous, year-round recreational hot spot!

Although this rental sits right on the fairway, there is more than golf to enjoy when you make this getaway your home away from home on the mountain! In the winter, you'll be within half an hour of Skibowl, Mt. Hood Meadows, and Timberline Lodge for skiing, snowboarding, sledding, and more. The surrounding National Forest is full of trails for snowshoeing and hearty winter hikes, and your access to the Resort at the Mountain amenities allows you to warm up in the hot tub or sauna after a day in the snow!

For a golfer, Welches should be holy ground, considering it was the site of Oregon's very first golf course in 1928. And when you, your family, or group stay at this beautiful mountain home in the warmer months, the fairway is literally your backyard. Just grab your clubs, step off the back porch, and tee-up!

On a sunny day, the spacious living room is warm and inviting, bathed in light through the skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows. In summer, the same large windows beautifully display the vibrant greens of the golf course. In winter, as you sit in front of a crackling fire in the huge wood fireplace with rock facade, you just might feel like you're in the great hall of an old estate. But this lovely home is anything but old. Not only will you have cable TV, dual DVD/VHS player, a CD player, and a stereo, you'll be able to hop on the laptop as well with the free WIFI.

After a long day of skiing or snowboarding, soak away your cares in the jetted tub in the upstairs bathroom, then curl up on the couch in the cinema room with a bowl of popcorn and watch your favorite movie.

Finding an eating spot in Welches shouldn't be a problem. Step out for haute cuisine at the beautiful Altitude Restaurant (part of the Resort on the Mountain complex), or choose from one of 12 other restaurants around Welches with every type of fare from pizza to salmon.

If you feel like cooking, this home has everything you'll need. It's fully stocked. With an electric range, lots of counter space, a dishwasher and disposal, the designated chef will have no trouble - from prep to cleanup - whipping up something great. Gather 'round the oval table in the adjacent dining room with plenty of room for six. When it's warm, step out on the back deck and fire up the gas grill. There, you'll find a small and beautiful tree-lined yard. Watch the golfers playing just steps away.

Don't let the two bedrooms fool you; the Fairway Retreat sleeps 10 comfortably. The master king suite has a private attached bathroom with a shower/tub combination, double sinks, and a giant walk-in closet. The second bedroom, upstairs, has a wonderful queen bed and a dresser in the closet with lots of storage room.

But that's not all! After a challenging night of board games, pull out the queen sofa bed in the loft. The cinema room also has a pull-out queen sofa bed and the sectional in the living room has a full size pullout.

On the main floor is a half bath and a full laundry room with a washer and dryer and wash sink to make laundry day a swift and easy task.

Your stay at Fairway Retreat comes with two free passes to the Resort at the Mountain Community, your key to the wealth of activities available at the resort. Along with the 27-hole championship golf course and 18-hole putting course, you'll have access to the resort's full-service spa, fitness center, croquet and lawn bowling court, sand volleyball and badminton courts, children's playground, and outdoor pool (enclosed and heated seasonally).

And that's just the resort! Eagle Creek Golf Course is about a half-hour away and Springwater Golf Course, in Estacada, is about 45 minutes. Since Welches is right next to Mount Hood National Forest, you'll be close to all the hiking, biking, fishing, its sixty square miles of forested mountains, lakes, and streams. For skiers, the home is 20 minutes from Skibowl, and 30 minutes from Mt. Hood Meadows and Timberline Lodge, making it an ideal Mt. Hood vacation home anytime of year!

The Fairway House was a little smaller than what appears in the picture, but overall with 10 people we were quite comfortable and happy with our stay.  There was enough sleeping area for all of us; just remember that the late niters should sleep outside in the loft and living room, b/c those are the open areas.  The convenience was great.  We were outside the more "touristy" area, but close and easy access to Mt. Hood and all of it's activities.  We were also really happy with the market and gas station right down the road from us.  The Vacasa staff was great and available till late into the night to answer even simple questions. Can't beat it for it's value and comfort.

We chose this house based on the proximity to the resort (everything is walking distance) and the fact that in photos the house looks less adorned than many others. With small children, less adored is a great feature. The house was a great size for us and felt safe, except for a large area rug that is curling at the edges which resulted in multiple trips by children and adults alike.

The description when we booked said there were 2 bedrooms plus 2 sofa beds and the house comfortably sleeps 8. When we received our check in instructions a week before our stay, the sofa beds were changed to air mattresses and our hope was that they were the high quality fairly comfortable ones. They were not. The house has 2 very comfortable beds in the bedrooms, and 2 air very basic air mattresses that you can use in extra rooms with big skylights overhead. Great for daytime, not good for kids if you want them to sleep past dawn or nap during the day.

There was a power outage at the resort during our stay. The home had one working battery-powered lantern (whew!) and one battery-less flashlight (boo). We lit a fire in the wood burning fireplace but had to put it out as the smoke backed up and came into the living room and quickly drifted upstairs to the bedrooms. The flue was open, so the chimney may be blocked and in need of a cleaning.

Still, this house was a good place for us to stay, but the fireplace needs attention and the air mattresses were disappointing.

We enjoyed several special days with our two grown children, their spouses, and our two new granddaughters.  The layout of the living room, adjacent eating area, and kitchen lend themselves to good conversation.  Instructions for check-in were easy to follow; we found everything clean and in good condition.  The kitchen is well equipped.  It was a real plus to be within walking distance to all of the activities at the Resort at the Mountain.  It was important to me when I selected this home that we would have access to the resort. This home provides you with a pass.  One suggestion:  put a bed in the second upstairs bedroom instead of using a pullout.

This place is incredible. It's peaceful and beautiful! Great getaway location with plenty to do in the surrounding area.

You can't beat the price for everything you get. The house is well appointed and the access to the resort ammenities makes it silly to rent a hotel room.

The place was in a great location if you're skiing Mt Hood. It was about a 20 minute drive to Meadows plus we took advantage of discounted lift tickets which was excellent. We lucked out and got to the place just before the biggest snowstorm of the year, but had no problem getting to and from the mountain in our SUV. A few restaurants were near by which made dinner easy. I would recommend this place to anyone trying to ski or snowboard Mt Hood.

We stayed here because our niece was getting married at the Resort. This was very close and way cheaper than renting 2 rooms there!

The whole experience was great.  The property and amenities were excellent, clean, convenient and beautiful.  The rental process was easy and fast.  The value was well worth the relatively low cost.

As stated above, I rented the house with friends for an annual ski trip that I organize. I grew up in Oregon but haven't lived there in 5 years so I take this trip as my visit home to visit everyone. My occupation is very hectic with variable hours and Vacasa and the Property owners went above and beyond in working with me and my schedule. I'd just like to say thanks for that, especially because I had to plan flights as well.

The property is as advertised, the resort recreational building is maybe a 10-15 min walk, 2-3 min drive, although we never used it. House was clean and roomy, with a nice whole home audio system hidden in the closet.

Meadows is 45 min-1 hour drive, Timberline 30 min or so.

Only thing that would have been nice is more garbage bags, we cooked both nights and had alot of trash.

Overall a great property and staff, will definitely think of them again for next year.

Very clean and well stocked home.  We purchased a late check out and that  was wonderful on Sunday.  We also contacted Vacasa to get a discount on lift tickets and they were so helpful on short notice.

Great central location to where we were and close enough to Portland to visit there as well. Pretty property and amenities.

I felt very at home in this house.  I was so impressed with all the extra's left from other guests, didn't need to bring or buy much, except food.  I can't wait to stay again, my family lives close by and it was nice to have them over to my home away from home.  We had such a relaxing time.  Thanks again

Chase and Dina Ence

Our family Loved this house. It was very roomy and comfy. Great location to check things out in Welches and on Mt. Hood. Fun was had by ALL!! Can't wait to stay again.

We would like to stay again next NYE's!

At this dog-friendly Government Camp vacation rental, you'll feel hugged by the woodsy wilderness all around. Situated at a wonderful spot at the base of Glade Trail, this hideaway is equipped with modern amenities like TV and WiFi so you won't feel like a bear in hibernation.

Inside, you'll feel the same rough-hewn ambiance, with only intermittent splashes of modernity. Soft leather chairs offer a welcome respite from the rigors of skiing, hiking, or cycling. You can watch a movie or check on local activities or eateries via the WiFi.

At mealtime, the chef will have a fully-stocked kitchen to prep delights for the whole crew to dine on. As you chow down, you can make plans around the unique, granite-topped kitchen island under the bear-themed lamp.

When it's time for bed you'll find that Little Bear isn't so little. With three bedrooms and a loft, it will sleep 12 comfortably. The master bedroom is on the top floor and includes a queen-size bed with a private bathroom and an open loft that houses an additional queen mattress. A large bathroom splits the hall between this room and the second upstairs bedroom, which includes two sets of bunk beds and a queen bed. The third bedroom is on the main floor and contains another set of bunk beds and queen bed as well.

As you might suspect, where there's a Little Bear, there's a Big Bear as well - a second cabin right next door, that is. Combine the two cabins, and you have the perfect place for a family reunion (up to 31) or that corporate seminar away from ringing phones. Big Bear and Little Bear do share a hot tub.

There's even plenty of room for you to bring up to two of you dog friends. Just remember we have a $10/night, per pet fee, with a minimum of $40 per stay.

There's lots to do around Government Camp. In addition to the popular trail right outside your door, skiers have quick access to Skibowl just a few minutes away. Mount Hood Meadows is a little farther, about 17 minutes away, and Timberline Ski Area is about six miles.

When the white hills turn green in summer, they're full of hikers, cyclists, white-water rafters, kayakers...every fun summer activity. Take in the sounds of beautiful Camp Creek that runs between Big and Little Bear cabins.

There are festivals all year long! There's Mount Hood Heritage Day in September, Hood River Hops Fest in October, and the Annual Wine & Art Festival in November.

So, when you're looking for a Mount Hood vacation rental, why not give the Little Bear a chance?

the property was amazing.  The supplies at the cabin were well above what was expected.  They provided everything possible even down to the laundry detergent to paper towels in the kitchen.  The cleanliness of the cabin was spectacular.

Problems:

Didn't have the correct key code to get the door key. I had to call Vacasa to get correct key code. What if I couldn't get ahold of anyone, then what would I have done turn around and go home?  This is very disturbing.  When we got the correct key the lock is so badly keyed we finally got door opened . It took 20 min to get key to turn in lock....NEEd TO GET A Locksmith out their to fix lock. Leaving was just as difficult to lock back up.

WiFi  is pretty non existent router in big cabin.  Get a service exclusively for little bear. Cost is enough that we should have service. I had to use my hotspot on cell phone.

In email that gives you key access should add wifi password.

The welcome binder said to put garbage out in receptacles outside. No receptacle anywhere so we bagged up trash neatly and left for house cleaners with note.

However the cabin was excellent and provided all comforts of home.  Fix the items outlined and they stay would be perfect. I will go back.

The place was perfect for what we needed. Gov't camp isn't all that exciting, but had some great restaurants, Hood River was close enough to drive to for the day as were the slopes. The house was awesome, bedrooms were a little tight on space, but we really didn't spend any time but sleeping time in them. The kitchen had everything we needed except a baking dish. We were super concerned about making too much noise and not getting fined, but the creek by the house drowned out any noise coming from the inside so it wasn't an issue. We just made sure to stay out of the hot tub after 10 to be sure we kept our outside noise down. The hot tub we shared with Big Bear cabin, I was a little surprised to find that out, but it worked out. Our neighbors in Big Bear were great and we had no conflict of timing with hot tub use. This place was exactly what I was wanting for my birthday weekend.

Definitely coming back!  So many ski area nearby and Government Camp is an awesome town.

While we didn't get the snow we hoped for, this little cabin was big on sleeping spaces and perfect for families with kids.  The location is walking distance to town and the Glade Trail is just up the street, perfect for sledding.  There were a few maintenance issues that need to be fixed, and the wifi may not work, but otherwise it was a good house for our weekend there.  For cooks, be sure to bring 1 or 2 extra baking pans - the kitchen is well stocked with stove-top saute pans and skillets, but not for baking or roasting in the oven.  There is no dining table - just a kitchen island with a lot of stools around it.  Great for casual meals, but a little cramped for more than 6 and the place sleeps 12.

We had a great time staying at Little Bear. Very clean and it was stocked with everything we needed. We would recommend this cabin!

Let me start by saying how much I loved this cabin. Really charming and in a beautiful little spot in the woods not too far from Government Camp. But you're not reading this for all the ways it's good. So here are my warnings:

- There are plenty of beds and space for people to stretch out once they go to bed, but the kitchen and living room are small. There were 6 of us and kept tripping over each other while we were cooking

-It's tucked behind Big Bear Cabin and if it's snowy it's pretty tough to climb to, even if you're a hearty skier.

-A little pricey for my tastes.

Everything was perfect.  Only thing that we wished we had was a cheese grater.  Thanks.

Pet-friendly cabin in the woods with private hot tub!

With a private hot tub and warm, inviting atmosphere, this cozy Brightwood vacation rental is within an easy drive of ski slopes - and just across the street from beautiful hiking trails at the Wildwood Recreation Site!

The cabin is surrounded by fir, pine, and cedar trees, making the back porch a fragrant spot to sip your morning coffee in the fresh mountain air as you listen to the Sandy River rushing by. If it's chilly, skip the coffee and wake up with an invigorating dip in the hot tub instead!

Inside, you'll have all the comforts of home as well - a cozy gas fireplace, complimentary Internet, and a TV with DVD/VCR. (There's a well-stocked video store just down the road.) And, of course, a view of the forest is never far away through the wide windows.

Need a big breakfast before you head up the mountain to the ski slopes? This well-stocked kitchen has you covered: not only is there a new stove, microwave, and dishwasher, there's also a bagel toaster, coffee pot, waffle iron, and food processor! Serve it all up around the big wooden table with room for six (two more can cozy up to the bar on the comfortable, cushioned stools). If you feel like preparing dinner at home, head outside and barbecue on the gas grill. There's also a fire pit as well for late-night s'mores! All the groceries you might need are within easy reach too - Thriftway is just two miles up the highway, with restaurants for dining out even closer to home (wild boar tacos and a pitcher of margaritas at El Burro Loco, anyone?).

While the cabin technically only has one bedroom, it's been carefully furnished to make it comfortable for up to six guests to share! The first-floor bedroom has a queen bed, and the living room has a full-sized sofabed. Upstairs in the loft, you'll find a set of twin bunk beds and a full-sized futon. There's a full bathroom on the first floor, and a convenient half-bath up in the loft to make mornings run smoothly. The loft even has access to an upper-level deck where you can enjoy the views through the forest canopy (the perfect perch for birdwatchers!).

Your stay at Wildwood will put you close to all the activities, summer and winter, the Mt. Hood area has to offer. Of course, with the Sandy and Salmon Rivers nearby, you're going to need your rod and tackle box. Cyclists: There are no less than 17 bike trails of varying difficulty nearby. And since you're in Mount Hood National Forest, there's plenty of hiking trails, kayaking, canoeing, and horseback riding. Skiers: There are four ski resorts nearby where you can also ski cross country, snowboard, snowshoe, tube, snowmobile, or just relax on a sleigh-ride.

This Mt. Hood vacation rental is even dog-friendly, with a nightly pet fee. Please note that since the cabin is in a residential neighborhood with full-time neighbors, it does come with a strictly enforced six-person limit and noise ordinance... i.e., parties are not allowed.

For a relaxing getaway on the mountain, look no further than this comfortable, cozy Mt. Hood vacation rental!

I was initially double-charged for the stay.  I had to contact your staff twice to get a refund of the double-charge (the first time they told me it was correct).

Then, the property was booked to another customer, who showed up after midnight on Friday, waking up our group.  I assume the double-booking had something to do with when they cancelled the second, erroneous charge, but don't know.  We called the management and a second property was found for the other group, but we needed to host them for an hour before everything was resolved and they received an email with instructions, so we did not get back to bed until after 1am.

The WiFi didn't seem to work.  I could connect to the network, but not to the internet.

Also, the igniter on the grill does not work and the burners need cleaning BADLY - many sections did not light.  One of the large stove burners also did not work.

The hot tub jets do not seem to work very well and we could not figure out how to

The property is very affordable and in a great location.  It has wonderful amenities and is very relaxing.  The Vacasa staff did work quickly to resolve the issues that arose and were very courteous.

Beautiful home! Perfect for a weekend get away. Lots of options for the family to enjoy

A nice spot for a family or couple getaway. Very quiet.

We really enjoyed our stay. The cabin was more home like, very clean & comfortable! Would be a great place for a family! Loved the vaulted ceilings and big windows, very bright & cheery, especially for the mountains! The surrounding yard needs some TLC and the driveway was a bit challenging, but we were there for much needed R&R, including hot tubbing, not the yard, which we got. We will be back again and would certainly recommend this property to others.

The cabin was a great stay, close to facilities and activities.  With so many beautiful views of nature, I was surprised to see so many people going for the thrill experiences.  I hope they also took time to enjoy the natural world in the mountains.  The hike to Mirror Lake was a great experience walking through cathedral forest opening to inspiring vistas.

This is a sweet little getaway spot. Super clean on our arrival and the cabin had everything we needed for a comfortable, relaxing stay. The bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept in - perfect firmness! Hikes in the area were great and desserts at the Rendezvous restaurant were top notch. We'd definitely stay here again.

We thought we were staying  a lot closer to Mt Hood, and  this area is extremely cluttered with all kinds of junk.  They tried to remodel but the over-all atmosphere is depressing.  We will not be staying in the area again.  It was my mistake not to research the places and area better.

If you are a looking for a small inexpensive cabin not to far from the mountain, this is it. The cabin itself is decent and about 30 minutes (w/o chains) from Mt. Hood. It was nice to find a place that wasn't over priced semi last minute (3 weeks).  The hot tub was an added bonus.

We wanted a cabin in the woods to escape to.  This was perfect.  It had cable tv and internet so we could connect with the outside world when we wished.   Hot  tub was  an excellent bonus.    Great Mexican restaurant within  margarita walking distantly.    Very fun wild life area with great trails literally across the highway.

We stayed here with 6 people very comfortably.  Hottub was great, very peaceful area, 15 min to timberline,  loved the board game selection and openness of the cabin.

The location was great for our ski trip. House was clean and cozy and the hot tub was stellar after a day on the mountain. The staff was incredibly helpful and easy to get in touch with. I'd recommend the cabin and the staff!

Very good value for a quick getaway from the city for a few nights.  The house is well appointed.  I would recommend bringing your own electric skillet for cooking breakfast and espresso machine if you're a coffee snob like me :-)  Run up to Mt. Hood Roasters in Rhododenron for some great beans and hold up in this functional cabin for the weekend.  Good wifi and cozy propane stove make for a comfy stay.  The hot tub doesn't hurt either :-)  Only has a neighbor on one side and you can hear the river from the front yard that is a short walk across the street and down from the house.

Nice A-frame cabin nestled in the woods in Brightwood.  Enjoyed the location and your friendly neighbors that offered directions and tips on enjoying the area.

The rental is that close to the river. It was quite tranquil to hear the rushing water in the early morning. Great getaway in the mountain.

We loved this Mount Hood cabin from start to finish.  The location is a easily accessible to the Mount Hood Adventure Park, the ski areas (where they still ski/snowboard in July!!!) and to the wineries/restaurants of Hood River.  We enjoyed the beautiful scenic drives and met some very friendly people in the area.  The fly fishing shop just down the street set up our 2 boys with rentals and a quick lesson, and they were off to explore and fish in the area rivers.  The house was well-appointed and spacious - just what you'd expect for a mountain cabin.  Neighbors are close by, so don't expect total seclusion.  Definitely hit the Skyway Bar & Grill down the street for a unique dining/cocktail experience.  Wish we could've stayed a few days more.

We LOVED this vacation cabin. Perfectly located between Sandy and the ski areas. Very clean and comfortable. Hottub was a plus to enjoy at the end of the day.

We stayed a few days during our winter break and had a relaxing time.  We woke up to snow the first morning and went sledding.  We also took the dog for a walk to the beautiful river just down the road.  The cabin was cozy for our family of 5. The hot tub was clean.  There is a grocery store 3 minutes away and a Chinese restaurant.  We had a great time but you might want to bring a hair dryer.

The cabin is cute and cozy. My only disappointment was the fireplace is gas and i love a real wood fireplace, I am sure it said it was a gas fireplace somewhere. The location is great and you can hear the rushing water of the river. It is a short walk to the river and fun to walk along it and explore. The mountain air is so refreshing. We had a wonderful time and the staff of Vacasa was very helpful and accomodating. Great vacation!

Excellent place to stay. Very comfortable clean place. We hiked into Mirror Lake in the snow. just beautiful. convenient location.

This house was very clean and comfortable. We spent our days hiking on different trails on Mt. Hood, and this house was convenient to those trails and to the stores and restaurants. It was so nice to have all the big windows, so we had plenty of natural light. The "yard" seemed neglected, and the huge rock planter, full of weeds, was in the way for us to park our full sized truck up next to the house. But the inside was well taken care of. The water has a slight sulfur smell, but it didn't alter the taste. We filled up our water bottles for our hikes and didn't taste a thing. The only thing that was missing was a cutting board in the kitchen. Other than that, for the 2 of us, it had everything we needed. We would rent this house again.

We loved the place, what you see in the pictures is what you get. Very relaxing to be in the middle of no where if you want a place to getaway and relax.

What more can I ask for...great, clean house and awesome customer service!

Make sure to take some bottled water with you, unless you like drinking water that smells like rotten eggs... The house is very cool, though. Stayed there twice and had a blast both times.

There is no Wildwood Cafe - instead look for the orange sign of the Wildwood Motel on Hwy 26. The roadway to the cabin is through the white rock pillars across the highway (north side). Also, if you want to use the hot tub during cold weather adjust its temperature when you first arrive...it took it 24 hours to go from 82 to 104 degrees (top end).  The cabin is awesome & in a terrific location. Remember to bring a decent skillet & steamer to complement the almost complete kitchen.

My family and I loved our stay at this cabin. It was very clean and comfortable, warm and cozy. Hot tub was awesome in the crisp air. It would have been great to have cable to keep the kids a bit more entertained, or perhaps have a little movie library at the cabin. When we got there the neighbor was burning something but thankfully I expected it from reading the reviews, so I was prepared and knew not to let that get to me. He only burned something the first day we were there. Seems like a lot of the country folk out there burn random stuff. Is there recycling on the property? I couldn't find a bin, so we just took it home to recycle ourselves. Would be nice if that were an option there. Maybe that's what everyone burns in their yard there, the recycling? Anyhow, lovely time was had and we shall most likely return. Oh, and I was touched by the dog bowl and dog leash that were available, it is so nice to have your four legged friends be welcomed like that. The bed in the downstairs bedroom hurt our backs by the way. Perhaps something to put on the list for the owners to improve the quality. The kids seemed fine in the bunk beds.

Clean,comfortable and close to Portland. Unfortunately the WIFI did not work and the sound system for the TV was lacking. I trust these were not bad things as it meant for more games of Risk. Great game collection.

the directions were misleading. There is no Wildwood Cafe across from E. Moutainaire Rd. It's the Mountainaire Motel across from the 2 stone columns

We had a great time. We really enjoyed our stay. The place is cozy and comfortable. The hot tub was a nice plus.

Very cozy and warm.

Fairly secluded. Nice set up

Very grateful for the last minute availability for a mothers day getaway here w/ my 4 kids. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the beds werent the most comfortable (platform style downstairs) & futon upstairs not any better. But the hot tub & ambiance of the fireplace....& well appointed cabin w/ everything u need....made this trip very awesome. Driveway is tricky for large SUV but very doable. Would love to come back next year as well. Thanks so much!

This is a cozy little get-away with everything you need to relax, and only about 20 minutes drive from Government Camp.  It was easy to find, and there were games and books available for use.  I was told there was a place to take a walk nearby, but didn't have a chance to find out.  Not too many complaints overall.  The first day of our stay the thermostat wasn't working and the water heater had been turned off, but Vacasa was very helpful in sending someone to replace the thermostat and find the braker panel, and they were willing to give us a free night to make up for a whole day of cold showers and chilly rooms.  The upstairs bunk I slept in wasn't comfortable; the springs were sticking up through the mattress. Overall very happy with the experience, especially with the availability of management to answer phone calls and respond to an unexpected situation.

Not sure if I would rent this house again.  It has all the basics that you would expect a rental to have, but the house is very close to the neighbor, has an awkward outdoor space/parking situation and is in need of some TLC.

was not with the property but with the neighbor. He was burning plastic and it smelled terrible. The house itself was great, and it is close to a lot of fun things to do and I will probably stay here again (if ever I have time) because I liked it, and I assume that the neighbor doesn't burn 365 days a year.

Would love to stay at this cabin again; I would definitely recommend it.  Cozy cabin, great value, and close to snow recreation.

As one of ten units in the historic 1941 lodge (originally built as the terminal for a gondola between the town & Timberline), your stay includes access to community amenities like a heated geothermal year-round pool, a rec room with wood-burning fireplace, wet bar, pool table and foosball, coin-operated laundry facilities, and outstanding views of Mt. Hood and Ski Bowl from the wraparound decks.

There is a comfortable queen bed and a sleeper sofa and a full bath, plus a cable TV with DVD player for relaxing movie nights. The free wi fi is available on the first floor of the complex only.

The kitchen has all the essentials: fridge, oven with stovetop, microwave, coffeemaker, and enough pots, pans, dishes, and utensils to whip up a hearty breakfast before a day on the mountain. Of course, if you don't feel like cooking, the brewpub and restaurants of Government Camp are just a short walk from your door.

You can walk to skiing at SkiBowl, or drive just a few miles further up the mountain to Timberline and Mt. Hood Meadows! In the summer, the area is surrounded by hiking and biking trails, alpine lakes, wildflower-filled meadows, and amazing scenic vistas of the mountain. Stay in the heart of it all here at the Thunderhead Lodge!

I had to cancel my plans to attend an x-c ski race because of lack of snow (the race itself was cancelled).  I asked for a partial refund or at least a refund of the cleaning fee because I wasn't planning to stay there at all.  I was denied.  I am not sure how a business can justify collecting a cleaning fee when no cleaning is necessary.

We stayed MLK weekend at the Thunderhead Lodge unit 201. Overall, we were unhappy with our stay, mostly because the beds, linens, pillows were TERRIBLE. Both nights we were all up most of the night tossing and turning to the point where we didn't ski on Monday and just went home because we were exhausted. The pullout couch was almost better than the actual bed. The property was kind of tired looking and old, both in the unit and the lodge itself. There is zero sound proofing so you can hear people all night. Terrible shower. The entry to the unit is a key pad, which seems cool, until you realize that any guest who stayed before can get into it (I guess?). The heated pool was pretty cool.

We really like the Thunderhead Lodge and its amenities.  Be aware- the Vacasa room at Thunderhead Lodge is a studio and would be best for a single couple.  The sofa is not ideal for sleeping on and kitchen is in need of an update.  We did, however, love the pool and community room.  Nearby trails were great for hiking and Timberline Lodge was only a few miles up the road.

Wonderful location, close to many Mt Hood attractions and very clean. I would like the future visitors to be aware of two things. These are NOT complaints but facts which may be okay for many visitors.

It was supposed to sleep 4 comfortably but in reality there was only one queen bed.

Also being a suite with a kitchen, it was on the third floor without an elevator meaning there was a lot of carrying things up the stairs and carrying them back while checking out esp if 4 people are staying and you are bringing in everything upfront and cooking all the meals.

Get to know the incredible Pacific Northwest firsthand by staying in one of our Mt. Hood vacation rentals in Sandy, Oregon! Sandy is truly an outdoor adventure base with its close proximity to the hiking, biking, kayaking, and skiing nestled around the gorgeous Mt. Hood area. With plenty of outdoor activities to choose from, the fantastic cities of Portland and Hood River both within an hour's drive, plus the cute little bars and restaurants right in town, Sandy is a great place to spend some time with friends or family.

Sandy is named after the Sandy River, originally coined the "Quicksand River" by Lewis and Clark, so there are tons of options to choose from for swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, or fishing. This area is beautiful anytime of year, but the summer brings especially great weather for hiking or mountain biking. On a clear day, make sure to head up to Jonsrud Point for a breathtaking view of Mt. Hood.

Sandy is truly the gateway to some of the state's most breathtaking scenery and outdoor adventures, with a huge variety of destinations within an easy hour's drive of our Sandy, Oregon rentals! Hop in the car for a trip up the mountain to the incredible skiing and snowboarding of Timberline, Mt. Hood Meadows, or Ski Bowl. There are also tons of beautiful hidden lakes in this part of Oregon, but both Trillium Lake and Lost Lake are can't-miss alpine escapes.

For an equally beautiful change of scenery, drive north and then east into the Columbia River Gorge to explore "Waterfall Alley", and catch a glimpse of the second-highest waterfall in the country: Multnomah Falls is also only an hour away!

Sandy is an incredible place to visit, not only because of the wonderful outdoor activities available, but also because of its history! Sandy was one of the final destinations on the Oregon Trail, and there are still old buildings from the 1800's hanging around to make you feel like you're back in the pioneer days. You can check out the Sandy Historical Museum for a brief history lesson, head to many of the nearby farms to pick your own food, or check out the Sandy Actor's Theatre for some awesome live entertainment. With the Sandy Mountain Festival, Sandy Oktoberfest, or the Hometown Holiday Festival over the year, there's plenty to celebrate!

Pushing 80, and looking great! That's what you'll say about this beautifully remodeled vacation rental cabin with room for six, just five minutes from great golfing at Resort at the Mountain, 400 feet from the rushing Zigzag River, and half way to paradise. With beautiful amenities like hardwood floors, knotty-pine paneling, and ceiling fans, this little cabin strikes just the right balance of character and convenience. Set on a double lot among cedar and vine maples, the Sandy River trails are just a short trek out your back door.

Come in! Lounge with a book by the gas stove nestled in its own brick-lined nook in the living area. Well-lit by a combination of recessed lighting and natural light through its uniquely designed windows, this is a cheery space where you'll find it easy to relax. Watch a DVD or your favorite cable show on the flat screen TV up in the loft. Bring some discs for the CD player. Oh, and load up the iPod -there's a dock for that as well. And grab the laptop top too. There's also wireless internet. In summer, head out on the big deck and enjoy the soothing sound of the Zigzag River as it tumbles by. Relax is the brand new hot tub and soak your cares away.  Strum the guitar and toast some marshmallows out by the fire pit.

Meals will be easy in this modern kitchen. The space is up-to-date and elegant. From its beautiful granite counters to its slate-tiled floor, your chef will have plenty of room to maneuver here with easy prep and clean up, including a dishwasher. Not only is the kitchen fully stocked, there's also an espresso machine and an electric griddle for those morning pancakes. Gather 'round the table for four (expands to six) and plan the day's activities.

In the bedroom on the main floor, you'll find a pillow top bed with a plush down comforter. The sofa/lounger folds out into a full bed as well. There's also a full bathroom on this floor. Head up the distinctly crafted stairway and experience the loft where you'll discover a sitting area where you can look out onto the trees surrounding the property, and hear the Zigzag rushing nearby.

This charming vacation rental cabin is halfway between Welches and Rhododendron and is close to five state parks. There's hiking along Mirror Lake, boating, rafting, climbing, horseback riding, fishing and more. And of course there's lots of golf around Welches. When you get hungry, the menu in Rhododendron is surprisingly diverse. Rhododendron has everything from ice cream, to pizza, to schnitzel. Watch them roast a fresh batch of beans at Mt. Hood Coffee Roasters. Skiers: This cabin is within 20 minutes of Mount Hood Meadows, Skibowl, and Timberline.

It was so cute. We especially liked the hot tub and the gas fireplace. The cabin was very clean and well-insulated.  We started with 3 adults, then two more came for one night. The cabin easily fit 5 adults. We recommend checking in first before going out to buy groceries because there are quite a few things (salt, sugar, creamer, etc.) in the cupboards. Lots of clean towels for everyone. We started with 3 adults, then two more came for one night. The cabin easily fit 5 adults.

It rained the majority of the weekend of our stay, but with the hot tub outside we loved it. Store & restaurants nearby and the neighbors seemed nice. Great vacation away from the city!

While not luxurious, perfectly adequate and appointed with everything you need to get away from it all while still remaining connected.

We had the opportunity to stay at this quaint little cabin for 4 days and three nights. The cabin was clean and had updated amenities. Note to future renters, pictures do make this cabin look bigger however, it was smaller than expected but not too small to have guests and hang out. The hot tub is a great addition to the cabin and makes clear nights even better to look at the stars!

The one downfall is that the cabin is in a neighborhood and has close neighbors. So, if you are looking for something that is secluded this would not be that cabin. All in all, great clean cabin to get away from the normal everyday routine and relax!

We wished we could have stayed longer! : )

my wife and I stayed here for a getaway. We enjoyed it very much. The description and amenities were wonderful. The TV is in the upstairs loft area, along with a cute seating area and bed. The kitchen had everything we needed and used the gas fire place as much as we could.     This place can definitely sleep 4 with the two beds easily and 6 if you wanted to use the futon.  There is no additional privacy tho for the futon and upstairs bed

We loved being here; it was honestly the best vacation we have ever had and the most beautiful. The cabin couldn't have been better or more perfect. It was awesome!

This cabin is an excellent location for a retreat. The neighborhood is quiet; the cabin is well-appointed and tastefully decorated. Access to Mt. Hood was a breeze. The cabin can accommodate two couples easily.  The VACASA folks make it easy.

Very cute and small cabin in a not so cute area pretty directly off of hwy 26. Very convenient, but like other reviews said, not secluded. The cabin was well kept and quaint. Very clean and tidy. The hot tub was very nice. The hot water heater didn't work at first but someone came out and fixed it while we were out. The cookware was pretty awful, mostly tephlon pans that were badly scratched and unusable. Overall though, it was a nice place.  I'd recommend it to some one looking for economic accommodations.

This cabin was amazing! Everything you need is provided (except coffee... bring your own coffee).  Grocery store is only about 2 miles down the road. Hot tub worked great. Only somewhat negative thing I can say is some of the surrounding properties are a little run down. It's a well lived-in community and you are the random tourists. Anyways, other than that it was an amazing stay and everything about the inside of the cabin was wonderful! They even have food dishes for your the furry members of your family!

Stayed here for two nights, and it was totally relaxing.  Everything you need, including a nice hot tub.  Fairly secluded, and far enough from Hwy 26, that you don't hear the traffic, at all.  Have already booked another stay at the cabin for next month!

We had a great stay at the cabin with a group of 6. I highly recommend!

This cabin was fabulous! We loved the close access to the Zig Zag River! We loved the modern kitchen and the gas fireplace! The hot tub was our favorite amenity-we used it both nights and it was private and had fun lights and powerful jets! We loved how closer we were to Timberline lodge! Overall this was a great expeirence!

We had 4 people total during the stay & the space provided was perfect!

The perfect little two room cabin getaway. This is the layout that my wife and I want for our house. Overall this was an amazing experience and was the perfect honeymoon getaway. I really hope the owners of this cabin get a chance to see this because they really made it feel like home.

Our favorite retreat home here.  The hot tub addition is fantastic!  Look forward to coming back.

This cabin has it all!!! a warm fireplace open loft and a spectacular view of the stars from the hot tub.  It is a welcome place to stay for a Mt. Hood getaway.  The river is less than a block away with easy access for fly fishing.  The Drive to Government Camp and the surrounding ski lodges are less then 15 min.  Clean and well thought out amenities show the  professionalism of Vacasa Vacation Rentals and the companies want to ensure your stay is satisfactory.  I would recommend  this cozy cottage and can't wait for my next stay there.

Pictures made the  place. Appealing but when walking through the door it is better than the pictures show. Not as big as I thought but for a couple get away it's perfect being right down the road from the mountain. Easy access although there was no snow in the area when we visited in January. Hopefully better seasons to come. Nice and quite  with a beautiful surrounding tucked away in the forest away from the highway. Looking to stay again in the next coming winter. Thank you staff

Cozy place with nice light walls.  Comfortable and warm.  Good beds and bedding.

One word sums up this little cabin. Charming. It's outward appearance doesn't offer you much in terms of appeal, but inside absolutely wins you over. It was very cozy and charming, from the paint, flooring to the furnishings. The whole environment there was extremely relaxing and warm. The cabin has cable tv in the loft upstairs, also has wireless internet as well. I would definitely come back in the future!

This is a nice, basic home. It can sleep quite a lot of people, but remember there is only one bathroom. The TV upstairs DOES have cable, unlike the description at the website. The floors are a little slanted, but it lends a kind of charm. The hot tub in the back is nice and hot - we liked sitting there under the stars. The views, while not "soaring", are of beautiful trees and ferns. The kitchen has been updated and is quite adequate, with lots of utensils. We didn't barbeque, but there is a gas grill available. This is a nice rental for the price.

less than 20 minutes to all of Ski bowl, Government Camp and Trillium Lake.....another 10-15 minutes to Timberline and other great lakes.

We had the best time and are sore from all the activities we got to do:

We did a zip line, bungee jumped, reverse bungee, intense mountain biking, zorb ball, lake swimming, paddle boarding, magic mile lift to the top of hood at timberline and played in snow...batting cages, hot tub... horseback riding and I know that  I am forgetting a lot.

Book this Cabin!!!

We especially loved that this little cabin in the woods had lots of sunshine comming in.  We used the front deck from morning until evening.

The upstairs loft was great for us and our two kids, while the grandparents slept in the bedroom downstairs. No TV in the living room or downstairs bedroom, which was totally fine by us, but just thought others might want to know. We were pleasantly surprised by the propane grill and outdoor furniture which was not listed in the description.

The neighborhood is very nice and yet very close to HWY 26, and the zigzag is really beautiful little Oregon river. Plus you it was very close to all the other beautiful offerings of Mt. Hood National Forest.

We weren't sure what to expect, but it was the best vacation I have ever been on. The property was beautiful, clean, secluded, and very woodsy and charming. Loved the location, loved the scenery, loved everything about it!

Great place, perfect for 6 people.  I loved the loft space for DVDs and gaming (we brought our Wii along).

The cabin slept 4 adult women comfortably and is conveniently located to Welches.  Nicely updated.

This is a perfect cabin for 1-2 couples or a family. It was very clean and comfortable. We will definitely stay here again. The pictures online do not do it justice!

Our friends and I had a great experience, cabin was very cozy and very welcoming. Location is nice and close to timberline and ski bowl. Recommend it, very comfy and homie. We didn't want to leave.

We stayed 4 nights and had a great time!  It's a comfortable little home and kept clean, with nice designs and features.  Upstairs is a great area to relax and room enough for several to sleep comfortably.

This little house was an amazing getaway! We came to ski at Timberline and loved our experience. The house was adorable and very well kept. We would recommend this to anyone :)

When we drove up the road to the cabin we were not sure what to expect, because the road was a little bumpy and the Oregon rain was coming down in full force. Once we were at the cabin it was the cutest little haven. We barely left the property and enjoyed our time exploring the nearby area, cooking in the beautiful kitchen, and relaxing by the fire. It was absolutely the getaway that we needed and we will come back again soon! Highly recommended for a weekend or a few nights away.

My wife Katie and I decided that we wanted to find a place that was far enough away yet close enough to be an easy way to go on vacation. We definitely found it. The cabin is very close to Mt. Hood and many other attractions. It is only a couple miles from town yet makes it feel like you are out in the woods. The location was very clean, quiet, and very comfortable and relaxing. The cabin exceeded my expectations and made for a great vacation. I am most likely going to return to this cabin for my next vacation.

Great place close go all Mt. hood fun.  Fyi wifi password may need updating in home instructions/info

We loved the cabin! Everything was spotless and very tastefully decorated. The location was beautiful and convenient. The only thing we wished we had was some outdoor furniture for the deck and perhaps a grill.

My daughter and I stayed at this cabin while she did a ski race camp.  It was comfortable and had everything we needed.  My daughter thought the loft was like a tree house.  We loved it and had a great experience.

The Cabin was clean and is very spacious than what we expected.  It has three beds that can comfortably sleep 2.  Additionally, the sofa converts to a bed for 2 more (kids, if you have).  Fire place in the back is good for camp fire kind of experience. Would recommend this cabin and will stay in the same when we visit Mt.Hood again.

lovely and so quiet and restful

It felt like home only cleaner. :)

Great experience! Had an amazing trip/weather. Will be renting this location again.

Perfect little cabin - just spacious enough to be warm and cozy. About 35 minutes to Timberline and 20 minutes to skibowl (without traffic).

Escape to a peaceful spot near Mt. Hood, right off the Sandy River and Hackett Creek, at this beautiful two bedroom Rhododendron vacation home. This home has a lot of character, including knotty pine accents and a slanted, wood beamed ceiling. You'll have charming creekside views, a private hot tub, and a great location near Timberline Ski Area, Mt. Hood Skibowl, and Mt. Hood Meadows!

The interior is rustically elegant with a cabin-in-the-woods motif. There are 20-foot tall ceilings and a wall of windows in the main living space that overlook Hackett Creek and the surrounding Mt. Hood National Forest. Decorative table lamps give this space a warm glow, as does the gas fireplace - perfect for both warmth and ambiance. Like a private mountain lodge, the walls are decorated with vintage snowshoes, skis, landscape paintings, and hunting memorabilia. On chilly evenings, you'll want to start a fire, settle back onto the red sofa, and watch a DVD on the flat screen TV - in addition, there's also a shelf full of books for borrowing.

A dining room in this large open space seats four and when it's time for meals, the full kitchen has everything you'll need, including a dishwasher! Put together a dish of vegetable lasagna, roast a rack of lamb, or just use the microwave to heat up leftovers. Since this area is also open to the living room, it's easy to socialize while making dinner.

Just out the door in the dining area, you'll find a delightful stone path that leads out to the hot tub and deck overlooking the Hackett Creek. After a day of skiing on the slopes or hiking a trail near the Sandy River, come back for a relaxing soak in the hot tub. Right outside the house, another deck - this one wraparound - has outdoor seating, a table for meals, and a fenced backyard area. This is a lovely spot to have morning coffee, afternoon tea, or even an after-dinner glass of port. There's also a gas grill for nice weather cookouts!

A large bedroom on the main level is light and airy, with a queen sized bed, more gorgeous knotty pine walls, ceiling beams, and a lovely wrought iron bed frame. Let the sun streaming through the windows wake you up each morning. There are bedside tables and lamps for extra convenience, so you'll always have a spot for your phone, glasses, or the book that you're reading.

Across from the main level bedroom, a small mudroom has a stackable washer and dryer, to keep everyone in clean and warm clothes during your Mt. Hood getaway. The bathroom is also located downstairs and has a tub and shower combination.

Upstairs in the loft, a second bedroom has an additional queen bed, slated, wood ceilings, and access to a deck overlooking the front yard. This room is cozy and outdoorsy in its theme, and in a hidden crawlspace, there's a futon for kids to play, nap, or spend a quiet afternoon reading. This mountain retreat will comfortably sleep up to four guests. Other amenities include a stereo, CD Player, and WiFi for checking email and staying in touch while away.

On the decks and in the backyard, you'll have beautiful views of mossy trees, the creek, and forest ferns. You'll find peace and tranquility here, as well as adventure out on the nearby trails. Depending on the time of year, there's hiking and biking paths, as well as snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails. For a fun afternoon, challenge yourself with a hike to Ramona Falls. This seven mile loop trail heads though lush scenery, and scenic footbridges.

In winter, Timberline, Mt. Hood Meadows, Summit Ski Area, and Mt. Hood Skibowl are all within a 20-40 minute drive away from this creekside vacation home. Mt. Hood Meadows is only 28 miles east and has a variety of terrain, 85 runs, and 140 acres devoted to night skiing! And on the drive back, if you don't feel like preparing something at home, Highway 26 has a number of meal options. Try The Rendezvous in Welches for rib eye steaks and salmon fish and chips or Wrapitude, just down the road, for a quick, healthy snack.

This spotless and well cared for Rhododendron vacation rental makes a great home base for exploring the majestic Mt. Hood area. Whether you come to ski, hike, fish in the nearby rivers and streams, or just relax, this Hackett Creek Hideaway will thoroughly charm you with its mountain lodge style and cozy furnishings.

This is the perfect spot to stay if you are visiting in  the  area.  We have stayed at 3 other locations and believe me,this is by far the best and the best price, too!   Hot tub on creek, beautiful landscaping, quaint cabin with all top notch ameneties, everything you could think of, even a washer and dryer and fast internet!     And to top it all off, the airlines delivered our lost luggage to the manager instead of our cabin and he personally delivered it to us!   What a great pkace!  We will be back!

The house seemed very secluded even though there were several houses near by. The grounds around the house were beautiful and the creek just off the deck was absolutely beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to go back sometime in the future.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hacket Creek Hideaway! It's right by a beautiful stream surrounded be flowering rhododendrons. The hot tub was a nice bonus after a long hike to beautiful Ramona Falls. The cabin is well stocked and very cozy. We would stay here again if we ever return to Mt. Hood!

My husband and I spent 3 nights, and could happily have stayed much longer. When we first drove in, I was surprised and a little disappointed to see the surrounding houses, but once you're inside this house, it's as if the others don't even exist. Very peaceful inside, gorgeous views through the multitude of windows, cozy fireplace, modern kitchen. It really couldn't have been better!

This home has everything you need to feel completely luxurious in a cabin in the woods, except maybe plush spa robes for the hot tub. It is a charming home upon approach and cozy to sit at the stove and read the evening away by fire light. The kitchen was appointed with anything I needed to cook and I didn't go out for any meals during my  stay! I simply didn't want to leave the quiet abode! The great wall of windows tuck right up to the creek and woods. It really adds to the feeling of seclusion, even in a slightly crammed neighborhood, it feels peaceful. The neighbors were quiet and didn't bother us. The hot tub and home were very clean. I especially appreciated that there was a pail for rinsing your feet just before stepping into the soothing tub! This is a  great home to getaway from it all.

I absolutely loved our stay at this property.  It was very clean and comfortable and I could sit on the back deck listening to the creek for hours.  The kitchen was well-stocked with pots/pans and utensils but you'll want to bring all of your own spices, etc. if you plan to cook. This property is perfect for a couple or a small family.  It's definitely not a party house and the neighbors are full-time residents.  Based on the information at the house, they'll call Vacasa and the police for noise complaints at 10:01pm.   The one thing that I found odd was that you have to use the key to lock the deadbolts and we actually then couldn't unlock the front door with the key the next morning so had to go around the house to unlock it from the outside.  We're already talking about the next time we can rent this house- it was perfect for our quiet couple's getaway.

This was perfect for our family of 4.  Found everything we needed.  Lovely setting, very quiet and comfortable.  Only suggestion:  the 2 doors to the porch on the riverside both have deadbolts that require a key to open.  Hence in an emergency, there is only one exit if you didn't unlock those doors previously or have the key handy.  Pretty sure that violates fire safety codes in most counties and hence I'd recommend a deadbolt that doesn't require a key to open from the inside.  That said, we'd go back anytime.

We loved this cozy little cabin in the woods. It has everything you need, from comfortable beds and a well stocked kitchen. The highlight of our trip was to be able to sit in the hot tub and watch salmon spawn right in front of us. It was a buatiful sight and educational too!

Our stay here was great, we enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub and listening to the creek. The beds were nice and firm. The use of refillable bottles for some of the provided toiletries and dish soap was eco-friendly. The windows in the main area don't have coverings, so it wasn't very private, however there were some trees that partially blocked the neighbours.

This place is tucked back in the corner of a col de sac.  It's awesome for that reason.  Though neighbors are around, we never heard them or noticed them.  The hot tub is almost completely hidden by trees and a fence.  The back deck sits right over that creek, and the creek sound amplifies through the entire house when the back windows are open.  It is very calming and relaxing.  I would definitely return to this gem of a cabin.

The cabin is very charming with a comfortable homey feel and is well stocked of all kitchen & household items.   It wasn't  as private as we had hoped but the neighbors were very quiet .... hardly knew they were there.

It is a place I'll consider returning to.

This place was just wonderful.  One of the cutest places we have ever booked.  Very rustic in feel.  but absolutely first class, with every modern convenience.  Every thing was in first class operating condition and the place was spotless.  A very romantic setting in the woods along a babbling creek.  The only improvement would be the downstairs mattress.  It rolled into the center so badly we were fighting it all night.  Spending a few hundred dollars on a new mattress set would make this place completely superb!  In spite of thatwe will stay again.  WE took a nice day trip over to Hood River.  That was fun.  One day we went to the Timberline lodge for the lunch buffet.

With all the modern comforts of home, access to resort amenities, and delightfully rustic furnishings and decor, this attractive and comfortable two bedroom chalet offers something special for everyone in your group!

Curl up by the cozy gas fireplace while you enjoy a movie on the 46" flat-screen TV with DVD player; prepare a gourmet meal in the chef's kitchen; or head to the year-round heated swimming pool or hot tub to soothe your muscles after a long day on the slopes (did we mention that Skibowl is just a short walk away?). Maybe you'd rather stroll to Government Camp's brewery for a fresh IPA or oatmeal stout, or head to the local outfitters to rent snowshoes or sign up for snowboard camp. Like we said - something for everyone!

In the living room, sink into the comfortable sofa after your busy day exploring the mountain. The gas fireplace adds a bit of cozy mountain ambiance, even while you enjoy the top-notch cable package on the flat-screen TV: movie fans will find seven HBO channels, and sports lovers can enjoy ESPN & ESPN2. You won't miss one email with our high speed internet available throughout the property.

With updated stainless steel appliances and plenty of granite countertops, the kitchen makes cooking for a group a delight. The cabinets are fully stocked with all of the pots and pans, dinnerware, cooking utensils, and dishes you may need, along with a few select countertop appliances (such as a coffee grinder and blender). Of course, the dishwasher makes clean-up a breeze. Take your cooking out to our balcony with our fantastic gas grill and breathe in the fresh mountain air while grilling!

The well-appointed vacation rental condo sleeps six guests very comfortably. The master bedroom has a luxurious king-sized bed, complete with Tempur-Pedic memory foam mattress for a wonderful night's sleep. The second bedroom has both a queen-sized bed, also with memory foam, and a set of twin bunk beds, making it ideal for either kids or a second couple. This bedroom has its own 32" flat-screen TV, so no disagreements will arise on movie nights.

And, you don't have to leave your dog pals at home, but please note that there is an additional pet fee.

As part of the lovely Collins Lake community, this stylish vacation rental condo includes complimentary access to a heated swimming pool, hot tubs, sauna, and luxurious clubhouse. Trails wind throughout the 28-acre complex, perfect for snowshoeing in the winter or casual hikes in the summer.

Beyond the boundaries of Collins Lake, all the adventures of Mt. Hood await. The town of Government Camp is an easy walk from your front door, with plenty of dining and shopping; make sure to drive just a few miles further up the mountain to visit the historic Timberline Lodge.  This property also includes a heated two car garage with a washer and dryer to dry out those wet ski clothes.

In the warmer months, the Mt. Hood area is paradise for hikers, mountain bikers, fishermen, kayakers, and nature lovers of all kinds. Winter, of course, brings excellent snowfall for skiers (both downhill and cross-country), snowboarders and snowshoers, as well as ideal conditions for those who prefer hot-chocolate drinking and cozy book-reading by the fire. Remember, there is something special for everyone here at this wonderful Collins Lake getaway!

Property is exactly as presented, great location and well maintained.  I only encountered one maintenance issue with a faulty water heater.  After notifying Vacasa, they immediately sent the property manager who repaired the problem and provided his contact information if we had any more problems.

The living room is very nicely furnished, and comfortable.  This condo is located on the road so it can be loud from the road noise.  The bed in the main bedroom was horrible.  It was wrapped in some sort of sanitary plastic wrapping that made it feel like we were sleeping on a diaper.  It made me sweaty, and was loud when we moved.  The plastic makes you sweat, so you get cold, and then you wrap up in another blanket, which makes you even sweatier.  It just made me feel gross, and not once did I get a good nights sleep.  The disposal was broken (We didn't have time to call, but I feel confident that if we did this would have been fixed).  The kitchen is pretty nicely equipped for making meals otherwise.  Plenty of blankets.  Plenty of towels.  The boot dryer was AWESOME!!  There is a terrible smell at the base of the stairs, and then the rest of the condo smelled like yucky overdose of cleaner (like there was a scent that was trying to be hidden).

While we couldn't control the weather (rained buckets the first day), this was a great location to use as home base. It was nice to walk up to Govy for meals and plan the day's adventures: Skiing, sledding, hiking. The heated pool/hot tub was a nice feature and the condo was clean and cozy. We'll be back!

Six of us and our dog stayed two nights at Collins #146 and had a great time. The condo is lovely, and the Collins Lake amenities are outstanding.

I would highly recommend staying at Lake Collins #146 and I plan on staying there again.  Hopefully the next time  we stay there will be snow for skiing! This year was bizzarre and we had no snow after Christmas and Skibowl was closed for skiing. We still had a great time, the town is the cutest place and the condo met our every need.  Within walking distance of everything and comfortable for all of us (4 adults and 1 child).

We had a wonderful time.  Only request is to leave instructions on how to light gas fireplace.  Thanks!

Our stay was very comfortable and convenient. The condo was perfect for our small group and two little dogs. Easy walking areas for pets and nice and quiet. Enjoyed the comforts of home that the condo offered and the easy walk to Govy restaurants and shops. We will definitely stay each summer we are in town for snowboard camp!

Excellent location, clean and comfortable and competitively priced plus your own garage to park your car!  Would definitely stay here again.

We wanted to stay at #146 because it look like our kind of place.  It first allowed pets and had 2.5 bathrooms. The boys had plenty of space and the living room was very relaxing.

The decor is spot on for the area and the colors they choose are very relaxing.  The upgrades in the kitchen make it like home.  To be able to pull into the garage with the ski rack on was fantastic.   The hot tub in the woods is one of the best in the northwest I am guessing.   Easy to walk into town to grab some food or shop a bit.  The view of Mt Hood out the front proves that you are in a mountain ski village.

We would stay again.

Nice and cozy. Had everything we need thank you

hot tub was hot and pool was too cold to stay for very long.

Quintessential cabin. That's what you'll say when you feast your eyes on this quaint little two bedroom Rhododendron vacation rental. Though its charming exterior says "rustic," step inside and see how imaginative design, great amenities, and an unsparing taste for elegance has made this little place into the proverbial diamond in the rough.

Poised between Steel Creek to the east and the Zigzag River to the west, take the nearby footbridge over the Zigzag where you can cross into the tiny hamlet of Rhododendron, a burg popular with ornithologists and close to winter spots like Skibowl and Timberline Lodge.

This is a sweet remodel! With vaulted ceilings, track lighting and large windows that invite the sunlight, this otherwise small space is liberated, cheery, and classy, giving it the illusion of a much bigger home. Throw a log on the fire, snuggle up on the plush couch and slip one of your favorite DVDs into the player or pick one from the library. There's also a big flat-screen with cable. With the beautiful hardwood floors and unfinished paneling, you'll feel like you're in an upscale resort (without the crowds!). After a long hike or a day on the slopes, slide into the bubbly warmth of the private hot tub.

This Rhododendron vacation rental sleeps four comfortably. It has two bedrooms, one with a queen bed, the other a full. There's also a crib for the little tike, The bedrooms are tastefully decorated with comfy linens and pillows. It has two nicely decorated bathrooms, one of which is also paneled and has a walk-in shower.

Like the rest of this vacation rental cabin, the kitchen is a balance of space, efficiency and elegance. In addition to an up-to-date stove, fridge, and fixtures, there's a microwave, a waffle iron, and a coffee maker and grinder. Serve it up at the lovely, modern dining set with room for four. Out on the deck you'll find a gas grill for a barbeque. When the weather's warm, head out to the backyard fire pit and enjoy the fresh mountain air with your toasted marshmallows and s'mores!

Close to two of the official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails, Rhododendron is a go-to spot for ornithologists. Huckleberry Haven is just 15 minutes to skiing at Skibowl and historic Timberline Lodge in nearby Government Camp where you can experience the area's rich history. You'll be close to all the great sites and recreational activities you'll find in the Mount Hood area, including world-class fishing. With its proximity to three rivers,(the Sandy River is very close by) Rhododendron is a haven for fly-fishing, offering up steelhead and salmon as the prize. And since you'll be smack dab in Mount Hood National Forest, you'll enjoy the benefit of 60 square miles of forest, streams, and lakes which, of course, means plenty of places to hike, bike, kayak, and just savor the abundance and beauty of the Mount Hood area.

The cabin was adorable. Tastefully decorated. Comfortable furniture. It had everything we needed. The only complaint would be that we couldn't use the hot tub. My daughter had suggested that we look inside the hot tub before it gets dark. Upon lifting off the cover we discovered that there was brown fungus growing inside all over on the walls. Thank goodness she thought to check before dark!

Also, from the pictures on VACASA website, you would never know that the cabin sits so close to so many other cabins. Super close!  But the cabin was clean, comfortable, updated and safe. Probably would go back due to lack of privacy.

The cabin itself was great - just the right amount of space for s small family (in our case 2 adults and 2 dogs).  The proximity to Mt. Hood can't be beat and the local restaurants nearby were great.  Things to take into consideration are how close the cabin is to the neighbors and the fact that you cannot access the river at the back of the property due to it being the apparent private property of someone else.  That said, I would definitely stay there again when looking to head back to the area.

We enjoyed the home and the hot tub. Everything was very clean. The main issue was how close this property is to the others on either side. City close. It didn't feel very private when going out to the hot tub. But we did enjoy ourselves and enjoyed walking around the man made paths in this community.

The cabin was beautiful and very cozy! Loved every detail, very well equipped. Would love to stay here again.

Had an amazing time.  Very relaxing, very romantic.  We didn't want to leave!  Thanks so much for a great weekend.

Right when I walked into the cabin my boyfriend of 5+ years proposed :)  it was a romantic stay.  the cabin is really nice and so are the neighbors to the cabin..  very animal friendly which we appreciate!!  cant wait to stay here again soon!!

Enjoyable quaint cabin with a wood fireplace on a snowy winters weekend. Below freezing temperatures outside and it stayed nice and warm inside. Take the time to run out to the hot tub bare foot with a few inches of snow on the ground and jump into a nice warm soothing tub with a view of beautiful fir tress covered in snow all around you. We will be back

Our first house was cold and did not have heat but our Vacasa specialist helped us and moved us to Huckleberry Haven which ended up being a great vacation home.

Explore all the stunning sights around Mt. Hood when you stay at this pleasantly-decorated one bedroom Welches vacation rental. In a quiet neighborhood, you'll be right next door to The Resort at the Mountain's historic golf course and the peaceful serenity of the Mt. Hood National Forest. With its golf green views and modern amenities, this laid-back getaway has everything you'll need for a weekend (or more!) in the mountains.

After a day of hiking, return to this Fairway Estates for wine and snacks on the glass coffee table. Or, turn your attention to the flat screen TV for some cable and a DVD, while you warm yourself in front of the fireplace. There's also WiFi so you can stay connected, research restaurants, or get directions to the nearest ski resort.

The full kitchen has all the major appliances you'll require (including a dishwasher) and lots of counter space. Perfect whether you're putting together a quick breakfast before heading out on a hike or preparing a multi-course meal at the end of an adventure-filled day. And since this main living area is all one open space, you can still enjoy the fireplace while sitting down to a meal at the dining table.

When you head off to bed, everyone will have a spot to lay their head. There's a queen sized bed, as well as a twin in the bedroom (also a second TV for late night channel surfing), and the sofa in the living room pulls out to a bed. This Mt. Hood vacation rental will easily sleep up to four guests. And if you have pets, up to two dogs (under 30-pounds each) can come on vacation as well with a $10 per day, per pet fee($40 minimum per stay).

But that's not all - this condo has a few more amenities! Right in the complex, there's a small playground for the kids, and you'll have a washer and dryer right in the unit. There'll be no worrying about keeping your clothes clean while out exploring here! (Please note that while this home is located next to the Resort on the Mountain, it does not include access to amenities like the pool and spa.)

Area hikes are plentiful, so you'll definitely want to pack your trail shoes. Ride your bike along the Sandy Ridge Trail or take the dog for an after-dinner walk around the neighborhood. There's fishing in the nearby Sandy River and on nights you don't want to cook, you can walk to The Resort at the Mountain's restaurant Altitude or make the short drive to the main drag for pizza and beer at the colorful ZigZag Inn. And of course, there's always world-class golfing at The Courses.

Downhill skiing and snowboarding are close by at three area ski resorts - Timberline, Mt. Hood Meadows, and Mt. Hood Skibowl are all are within a 24 mile drive. There's also cross-country skiing, snowboarding, and snowmobiling right nearby.

This Welches vacation getaway is perfect for both your wallet and sense of adventure. Year-round there's much to do, and at the end of the day, you'll have a comfortable condo to call home.

This spacious Government Camp vacation rental is the ideal place to bring a family! With gorgeous mountain views, space for 12 people (plus a dog or two), and plenty of entertainment options, this is a great place to plan a special outing with your loved ones.

Situated right in the town of Government Camp, when you stay here you will be within an easily walkable distance of a few eateries, a general store, and the Summit Ski Area. Timberline Lodge is just six miles up the mountain, and Mt. Hood Meadows is 11 miles away, so fans of snow sports will love it here!

The main floor of this home (the middle level) has a large living area with a beautiful wood-burning fireplace, and plenty of seating to watch DVDs on the TV. You are welcome to bring one large dog or two small dogs as long as they're well-behaved (a $10 nightly fee per pet with a $40 minimum per stay does apply), and your furry friend will love to curl up on the dog bed next to the fireplace.

A full kitchen has beautiful countertops and cabinets, gorgeous new appliances, and all the equipment you may need to prepare meals during your stay. A dining room table is an inviting spot to sit and enjoy your morning coffee together, or eat a leisurely dinner with your guests.

The main level also houses the master bedroom, where you will find a large king-size bed that will bring you sweet dreams during your vacation. A separate full bathroom has a shower, and a laundry room means that you won't have to worry about any wet and dirty clothes after a day exploring the mountain.

Upstairs are two more bedrooms. The first has a lovely queen-size bed and a chandelier to add a hint of elegance. The final bedroom has two full-size and two twin-size beds, so an entire family could easily sleep in this room.

Downstairs are even more sleeping spaces, with two comfortable sofabeds on this level. The second bathroom, featuring a shower/tub combination, is conveniently located next to the downstairs family room. Here you will find a great space for youngsters to hang out, pick a classic VHS movie to watch on the TV, play one of the provided board games, or simply spread out on the floor and play.

Outside, a deck has seating and a gas grill in case you feel like cooking up some burgers or grilled chicken for everyone. You will love spending time out here in the fresh air, admiring the view of the mountains and tree-lined scenery.

Up to 12 guests will be very comfortable in this lovely home. If you have a larger group, such as a family reunion or work retreat, this home can be booked along with this spacious home right next door. Together, these two houses can accommodate up to 33 guests!

In the colder months this area is blanketed in snow, making it a haven for skiers, snowboarders, and sledders. During the warmer months, the sun shines freely and the fragrant smell of pine trees welcomes visitors who flock here to hike, mountain bike, fish, and explore the forested beauty of the area.

Bring all your loved ones to this beautiful and comfortable Mt. Hood vacation rental, where everyone will have space to spread out, relax, and enjoy the vacation!

Very happy with the 3 nights we spent here.  We did a Mount Hood climb and the location was great for the quick access to Timberline Lodge trail and the Government camp stores and restaurants.  Beds were very comfy.

Not necessarily for others but the door in from the deck was unlocked when we arrived.  Our son thought we were already there and went up the steps and walked right in.

The house was in a perfect spot and comfortably slept all 11 if us.  The kids spent most daylight hours outside playing in the snow in the back yard.  Very nicely kept and had everything we needed.  Thanks for sharing with us and making a family weekend a lot of fun.

This was a really nice place and perfect for our vacation! Loved the fireplace and the kitchen was small but had absolutely everything you needed!! Loved that we were able to bring our dogs and they even had a dog bed & bowls! We will rent again...perfect location! Thanks so much!

Tight but comfortable. stairs are steep . great kitchen for one person . nice stove. Down stairs bedroom exceptionally nice and fluffy. boot/glove dryer was very useful . living room small with not so comfy couches but functional.

If you like ice cold showers this is the place for you. I thought the pictures on the website were deceiving as they made the rooms appear larger than they really are. I did find the beds to be very comfortable.

10 of us (and 2 dogs) had a great weekend!  Cross country skiing nearby, and the house is right by town!  Thanks!

This is a great house in a great location. It loved that it was only a short walk into town and a slightly longer walk to SkiBowl. We had a blast staying here for New Years. If you have small kids, the stairs up to the third floor are a bit treacherous as they are very steep and have no handrail. We also had some minor issues with the internet connection and the TV never worked for us, but we didn't mind since we weren't there to watch tv anyway. Overall, I think this is a great place to stay!

Step back in time with this peaceful three bedroom home, set along the historic Barlow Trail. Take a stroll on the footbridge that is set over the babbling stream (the path is about 150-feet from the driveway), relax by the warming fireplace, or prepare breakfast in the antique wood-burning stove. The Stove and Stream is the ultimate private getaway!

Hackett Creek along the front and a mountain stream running under the cabin create soothing sounds and mountain fresh water to drink. The water is filtered and tastes great!

The kitchen has a blend of old and new with a wood-burning South Bend Malleable Range  (please note that the antique wood stove is the only way to cook/bake in the kitchen), and an electric dishwasher. You can enjoy your meals in the kitchen or in the dining room. Both have seating for six with views of the meandering stream. Enjoy your morning coffee or evening wine watching the water go by, from your choice of the front or back deck.

The main level of the cabin has a cozy living room, making it the perfect place to tell stories, read a book or grab a game off the shelf to play with your family and friends. You will also find a bedroom and bathroom on the main level. The log staircase will lead you to the upper bedrooms. There you will have amazing views of the stream.

Looking for some adventure during your stay? The Sandy Ridge Trail System provides new recreation opportunities for mountain bikers and hikers to explore the foothills of the Cascade Range. As of July 2010, roughly 6.5 miles are open to public access. The trail head parking is only minutes away from the Stove & Stream Cabin. You have Ski Bowl and Timberline lodge approximately 20 minutes away for your sliding fun. Also a view point for the Sandy River is a short drive away.

Come, step back in time with the Stove & Stream Cabin. This is truly a vacationer's delight!

What an amazing experience we had.  This place is surrounded by creaks and streams, and even a pond.  The clear sky was PERFECT for the meteor shower. Only 2 down sides.  1) no bathtub or HotTub. Would have been an amazing addition.

2) being as they are on the septic tank system, there's that terrible sulfur smell from the drains.  Even a quick shower, you'll be chocked out.

But I still give 5 stars. This place is amazingly charming. You can hear the rushing strems from every room.   I can't wait to come back!

This is a beautiful and tranquil cabin and we really enjoyed our stay. The only major drawback is the smell emanating from the bathroom, presumably sulfur from the creek (not the septic tank located right next to the cabin?). It is significant enough that it should be noted in the description of the property for those who are considering spending time there.

This cabin is very rustic and cozy and since a stream runs beneath the cabin, you can hear the babbling from every room, all the time.  Slept like a baby (in a good way!)

I wanted to stay at this cabin because of the cook stove. I used it 3 times while there it smoked pretty bad  for about an hour due to air in the pipe but once that cleared it worked great. I fried potatoes and eggs and baked a pie. I had to ask for more wood they only provide enough for one night. Also mattress where hard.

We had a very nice stay here. The cabin is lovely and the rushing sounds of the stream just outside your window is soothing.  The kitchen is very well-stocked.

A few things to be aware of, though-

- The cabin is for sale. I have no idea if they tell realtors not to come by if there are guests.

- You cannot drive up to the cabin- parking is probably about 150 feet away- you cross a bridge over the stream to get there. Beware of slippery leaves on the bridge in fall, and plan ahead if it's pouring rain and you have to haul all your stuff to the cabin.

- The stairs to the upper level are very steep and a little slippery. The bathroom is downstairs. This may be a hazard for sleepy midnight trips!

- Headroom in the master bedroom is very low to each side of the bed- watch your head!

- We couldn't get the wood stove to work, even after following all of the directions carefully and even perusing articles online. The fire got nice and hot but the oven never did.

To be very clear- none of the above made this stay a bad one- this cabin is very cute, very cozy, loaded with amenities, in a beautiful location, and amazingly situated!

I also have to say the Vacasa staff were very helpful. We went out for dinner one night and a big wind storm arose while we were gone. We came back to find downed trees in the front and back, a broken window and twisted gutters- after we called that night they sent someone out early the next morning to start fixing things.

Very quiet place. Just know there is no tv or micro.

My friends and I were looking to unplug from the  city rush and we happened upon this picturesque cabin nestled in the woods.  We drank morning coffee on the deck,  listening to the stream and the birds.  We gathered around the fire each evening and relaxed and felt the tension leave our shoulders.  We made memories.

We've stayed at other cabins on Barlow Trail Road, but we now feel we have found our home-away-from-home.  Can't wait to book our next visit to Stove and Stream.

This cabin was so unique and cozy inside. The best part were the views of the stream running right under the kitchen through the windows and the sound of the water in the upstairs bedroom. It's a beautiful location set back with many other cabins along the Zig Zag river. Lots of good restaurants nearby to choose from and just close enough to all the ski resorts. This was a relaxing and comfortable home base for our new years holiday at the mountain.

We really enjoyed our stay.  The stream running under the cabin, the creek out front, the awesome wood cook stove and the beautiful rock fireplace were enchanting.  The cook stove really puts out the heat once you get it going and the fireplace was just what my soul had been yearning for.  It was very quiet with only the sound of the stream and crackle from the fireplace.  Absolutely enjoyed our stay.  The surrounding area is lovely and I will for sure return for more exploration and hiking.  I highly recommend this cabin if you are looking to get away from it all and completely unwind.

We absolutely loved our stay. The cabin is beautiful, and so unique.... the stream runs directly underneath the house! The cabin is tucked away amongst beautiful trees and we loved drinking our coffee in the mornings next to the picture window and planning our day. Great food, drinks and music at Skyway Bar & Grill. Beautiful hiking nearby, we loved Ramona Falls. We can't wait to get back soon.

Everything was clean and cozy for our visit. I would only say that if you bring dogs, know that you are very close to the road. We had to keep our dogs on leash when outside. But, they loved the stream ~ and so did we! Also, we really needed a barbecue and were disappointed there was not one available. Otherwise it was a beautiful cabin situated over a babbling stream!

Loved the very rustic cabin feel, and the sound of the stream going underneath. Also are very happy with the employes, we had lost the info to get in and we called on Christmas night and they answered the phone and talked us thru getting in to the cabin.

Fore! That's just what you might hear from the balcony when you make this lovely Mount Hood vacation rental condo your vacation headquarters during your visit to Welches, the historic epi-center of Oregon golfing. Overlooking the fairway, you'll find this lovely getaway is perfect for golfers, hikers, skiers, or expert relaxers alike.

In the morning, step out on the balcony with your coffee and fill your lungs with fresh mountain air as the mist hovers over the links and the early golfers make their way along the course. Inside, the living room awaits with a plush, new sectional sofa and, if the temperature has really dipped, a big wood fireplace with a stone facade. In the evening, after a day of fishing in the nearby Sandy or Salmon rivers, watch a cable show or slip a DVD into the player and unwind before dinner. Check tee-times on the laptop with the free WiFi. There's also a Wii system available for your use. (If you have your own games and hand-held controllers, bring them along!)

In the corner  -  compact yet fully equipped  -  is a smartly designed kitchen ready to help your cook whip up just about anything! Wood cabinets complement the beautiful black appliances. There's everything your cook will need: a stove, a big fridge, microwave, and plenty of pots and pans and utensils. Help with the prep work on the gorgeous granite counter, or sit on the stool and chat with the chef as he/she works. Help, too, with the clean up: it's easy with the dishwasher. When it's warm, fire up the gas grill out on the balcony and watch the golfers traverse the links as you enjoy your barbecue.

This condo has two bedrooms and room for 6. After a comfortable night's sleep on the queen bed in the master bedroom, you can step out on the balcony for an exhilarating breath of fresh air, and a great view of the tree-studded links. Click on the TV, and check the headlines on the morning cable shows. There's also a full, attached bath. There's room for four in the second bedroom, with two comfy queen beds, and its own private access to the balcony. There's a second full bathroom with a walk-in shower, and a washer and dryer too, so you can pack a little lighter. One dog is welcome, too, with a $40 minimum pet fee (a $10 nightly fee applies).

Yes, golf is the elephant in the room here: not only is it right outside, you can also hit the links over at Eagle Creek Golf Course (about a half-hour away) and Springwater Golf Course, in Estacada  (about 45 minutes). Non-golfers will find plenty to do, too. Nearby is the Wildwood National Forest (featuring its "Streamwatch" trail), and there are dozens of hiking trails of varying difficulty around Mount Hood. There's fishing, kayaking and rafting in the Sandy River. And, you can learn a little of the area's history with a trip to nearby historic Timblerline Lodge, or the Mount Hood Cultural Center. When the snow flies, Welches beckons skiers and boarders, as Skibowl is just 20 minutes away; Timberline Lodge is about half an hour's drive, and Mt. Hood Meadows just a little ways further.

Come stay in this lovely Welches vacation rental, where you'll not only be close to a rewarding game of golf, you'll be just minutes from all the activities (summer or winter) that come with 60 square miles of pristine wilderness in the Mount Hood National Forest.

I had one question, and it received attention right away.  Now, I am wondering if there is a two night minimum and if there is a cancellation policy.  We couldn't ski due to adverse snow conditions, but I definitely want to come back.  SOON.

Great location, view of beautiful golf

course, mountains and geese out back windows! Well-equipped, very nice condo.

We specifically picked this property out of others available because it promised to have wireless internet. After following the instructions in the book provided at the condo, we could not log in whatsoever. We called Cory and Brian at Vacasa to help us log in. They were not successful. Brian even drove to the condo (thank you for that effort) and attempted to fix the wireless router in person. It was not successful. Needless to say, this was a major disappointment!

This is a good home base for your Mt. Hood area exploration. The property has some great view and is well equipped for up to 6 person stay. It even has Netflix!

Me and wife celebrated our anniversary here. We enjoyed the peacefulness of the location. The scenery was simply amazing. I plan to bring my kids back during Christmas holidays.

Steps away from the river, plus a hot tub!

Dreams of authentic mountain living are about to come true when you stay in this cozy Brightwood vacation rental. This three-bedroom, three-bathroom home is the perfect rustic getaway, without losing any modern amenities.

Located in the Timberline Rim community, this split-level home is sure to offer guests a relaxing refuge from the real world. In ski season,  it's only about a 30-minute drive to Timberline for downhill skiing, and the slopes at Mt. Hood Ski Bowl in Government Camp are even closer! This beautiful home is surrounded by natural beauty, and invites you to enjoy the outdoors on two decks. Enjoy the seclusion of the surrounding trees, offering guests a real escape from reality.

Enjoy amazing views of the surrounding mountain slopes and river, which can be seen from multiple angles of the house. The main living space is bright and cheery, with a natural flair found in the sponge-painted green wall and the floral-themed decor and appliances. Settle into the leather sectional couch - big enough for all eight guests! Entertainment amenities like WiFi for streaming music and videos, cable for news and game shows on the flat screen TV, and a gas fireplace to curl up next to when it gets chilly make this the ultimate place for socializing. From here, head out to the hot tub to soak in after a day of skiing or hiking, or enjoy a meal while gazing out at the surrounding trees.

The family room downstairs has a futon for extra sleeping arrangements, and a beautiful patio from which guests can take a short walk down a flight of mossy stone steps to the river. Bring fishing poles for catch-and-release fishing (please note that proper licensing is required), or simply skip some stones or throw sticks for your canine companions. Finish up any last-minute work in the formal office with a computer and a printer - although you may find yourself staring out into a beautiful backyard garden, instead.

The full kitchen means delicious home-cooked meals - get busy with all the cooking extras you could desire, including a coffee grinder, a Crock pot, a blender, a mixer, and a waffle iron. Blond cabinets, a white oven/stove top, and stainless steel microwave and dishwasher complete this beautifully updated kitchen. Plug in your phone on the music doc for some light jazz during meal times at the six-top dining table.

Along with the family room futon, three queen beds await up to eight tired bodies, each bedroom with its own bathroom. Linens and active wear can be refreshed and warmed up in the washer/dryer. Don't leave Fido behind - your four-legged friend even gets their own bed! (Please note that an additional pet fee of $10 per pet, per night, and a $40 minimum per stay applies).

When you're not loafing around this beautiful Brightwood vacation home, check out the Timber Rim Rec Center for swimming and fitness, drive 20 minutes to Mt. Hood Skibowl for alpine sports, and the surrounding area for Nordic skiing and snowshoeing trails. Visit Little Crater Lake 50 minutes away for hiking and camping, or trek to Mirror Lake at the base of Mt. Hood, just a 20-minute drive from the house! Need a city fix? Take an hour drive to Portland!

One thing is sure, your next mountain adventure starts at this wonderful Mt. Hood vacation rental!

We showed up at the place and followed the instructions we received. It was fantastic. It looked exactly as shown in the pictures. The place was clean and had everything we wanted like plates, spoons, laundry stuff, etc. We didn't get to use the hot tub but it looked very inviting. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.

What a wonderful home for the 2nd half of our vacation!

Upstairs: A nice size kitchen with plenty of utensils, cookware and cooking methods. A great family room for gathering to play board gamed, listening to music and just having fun. Beautiful decorations, lighting and a nice ceiling fan. A large patio with a hot-tub, BBQ and gorgeous view of the Sandy River. Plenty of towels and blankets for those cold snowy days.

Downstairs: The office would have been more appreciated if it wasn't BYOC (bring you own computer) but we had our laptop anyway. Modern washing machine and dryer came in handy as we had our family adventures. A movie Room! with a wall screen and everything. But we couldn't find any type of projector system so that must be Bring your Own as well. A gigantic lower deck for any kind of get together you can think of. A ton of towels and blankets for cold nights.

My complaints are minor and do not detract form the overall wonderful experience of staying at the house: 1) Why couldn't we park in the garage? It was plenty big enough for our small SUV and empty. The neighbor wanted to paint his fence and we had to move our car to the street. 2) Better pest control around the windows and doors. We didn't let the mosquitoes or spiders get in the house, but we sure picked up lots of spray to manage them.

We had a great time and my family is still talking about the experience, location and fun. Thank you for letting us use your home for our vacation.

I spent weeks planning for my weekend and had choose a rental that looked perfect, welcoming interior, on a river etc... Well, after 3 plus hours of driving, we show up and the place was absolutely nothing like what the pictures and descriptions portrayed!! We were heartbroken, disappointed and felt misled to say the least.

That rental was not through Vacasa... So, here we were, around 7 in the evening, needing to break a contract and find a new place.. But how? Where? so late in the evening, 100's of miles from home... and on the side of the road.

I had to drive to cell service and was able to find Vacasa on the internet and call them on the phone... A talked to a real person. Her name was Chrissy (sp) (later supported wonderfully by Zach).

I told her she had a chance to be my hero.. And she was!! Within a very short time, she guided me on my iPad to look at a few options and the place we choose was sooooo much more than we could have dreamed of!! Better than perfect...

We had just the most amazing stay.. and so many times during our stay.. we looked at each other and said.. "can you believe this place?".

SO, I just want to express my deepest thanks to Vacasa, that they have real people to call, in our time of need, angels in disguise.. who helped us have the most heavenly experience.

this house is absolutely amazing. it is roomy, very, very, very clean! it pretty much had everything we needed. the serenity, and ambiance just rejuvenates you. we ended up staying a few extra days. originally we were there, my husband and I, for valentines weekend! Very romantic. and my 17 year old daughter joined us for the last two days. so family trip or a little romance this house is perfect. We really didn't want to go home! but we eventually did, and well relaxed. I loved waking up to the river in the back of the house with a hot cup of coffee. this house is really a jewel. Heads up to the owners  the only problems were that the gas grill off the back deck did not heat to over 250 degrees so we could not use it. the hot tub had somewhat of an odor "I think was probably due to low water or ph level. and there is also no desktop in the home office as stated in the house description. We ended up driving back to Troutdale to get my laptop for work. overall very minor due to the fact that the house is amazing! we will definitely be returning, hopefully those few issues will be rectified.

The house was well furnished and it was very relaxing to have our meals on the deck.  This rental added a lot of little extras that made ourmstay easier coming from out of state.

Loved staying just outside of Welches, comfy place nestled back behind the Resort at the Mountain.

We all had a wonderful time at Kiwi Cabin.  The kids enjoyed everything water-- which means creek and spa.  We really appreciated the proximity to the Ranger Station at Zigzag for all their good suggestions for activities.  It worked out very well to be out all day, and return in the evening for "water time" for the kids while dinner was being prepared for everyone.  Meal prep was  fun, and the kitchen well supplied with appliances, including a coffee grinder.  Beds were comfortable.  We spent little time on any deck, because meal times ended up being so late.  We would most definitely come here again.  The price seemed really fair for the location and amenities of the cabin.  Thanks!

We just had a FABULOUS weekend at Kiwi's cabin.  The cabin was perfect.  We loved the hot tub and games.  The surrounding area was gorgeous!!!!  We did some great hikes, exploring the Mt Hood National Forest and the backyard of the cabin, ie Salmon River.  All around awesome weekend!!!!  Thank you!

Our check in time was at 4 but Unfortunately the house keeper said he needed an additional 30 minutes before we can check in. He was also smoking in front of us on the property when he was talking to us which breaks the smoking on property policy. So many things unfortunately went wrong and im sorry to say we couldnt enjoy our stay as much as we hoped. Jacuzzi was our main priority and unfortunately we only got to use it for 2 days of the 4 days we were there.

We stayed in this rental house btw 11/27 and 11/30. Enjoyed the snow fall. The extra furnishing and roof outside the house, helped us to do BBQ even in rain.

Easily accessible. Snow has been cleared from the internal roads, I guess by some community initiative.

Kitchen is good has all required items. we were able to park 3 cars with sufficient space.

Replace the bulb on top of the BBQ Grill machine or make the switch to work. A curtain on the door to back side might reduce cold weather in the hall.

Just an hour from Portland and minutes off of Hwy 26, this cabin has all the amenities you need for a great family vacation.  It's located in a rural residential area, so you can see other homes, but the forest helps with privacy and it was always very quiet while we were there.

It sleeps 8 in real beds (no sofa beds in that count); do note that 2 of the twin beds are in tiny 'hidden' rooms off of the 2 upstairs bedrooms, which could be thrilling or creepy for kids - depending on age. There's one king room & one queen room upstairs, with a full bath. The king room has a balcony with table & chairs, and it's own TV & DVD player, as well as closet space with hangers.

Downstairs is a bedroom with 2 twins, plus open living, dining and kitchen areas, another full bath & a washer/dryer. This room has 3 entries, including one that goes directly to the hot tub on the side deck. The back deck faces a stream, and has a BBQ and lots of room, with table and chairs.

There's a TV, DVD player and DVDs in the living room, as well as satellite TV channels. There are plenty of towels, extra paper products and trash bags, a well-stocked kitchen and even shampoo/soap/conditioner provided in the bathrooms. The heater worked great as well.

The mosquitoes do come out in the evening, so be prepared if you want to sit outside. The hot tub was wonderful after a full day of hiking, and very well maintained.

The Vacasa staff were incredibly friendly and easy to work with, and the pricing was very reasonable. We had a great time, wanted for nothing, and would definitely recommend this property and Vacasa.

We were so happy with the home we stayed an extra night.  Very relaxing both inside and out.  Beds were comfy.   Kitchen had all the essentials.  Took walks each day in the area.  Would recommend Rendezvous for dinner and the pub at the resort for any meal.  Great to sit outside and just enjoy looking at the golf course.   Will return..

We were looking for someplace to stay that was relatively close to Mt Hood Meadows and had the amenities we wanted. The house was perfect, hot tub was a nice luxury after snowboarding all day. We even got snow at the house in March! We will definitely be back!

This was our first annual : "Sister Retreat ", when we arrived the view was breathtaking!  Had hard time getting deadbolt unlocked,  needs new one. We walk inside and the cabin welcomed us! Very homey and comfortable.  We were hoping for a fire pit! That would definitely be a plus! Hot tub was awesome. Very clean. I would recommend Kiwi Creekside Cabin, we will be back. Thank you so much for the memories.

We were stuck inside the whole weekend due to the very rainy weather. There were games and movies available and the house was comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay.

It felt like we were staying our in the wilderness with the beautiful trees yet we were close to shanty style houses. The house was cozy and the hottub was wonderful. The sheets were worn and the knives were dull, but maybe that's normal with rental houses. The Vacasa staff are awesome to work with. Lots of signage and very clear instructions.

Kiwi so great. Thanks loved hood area.  Janet and Arthur Kirkland wa

This cabin was sparkling clean, very cozy, and had a wonderful backyard overlooking the creek. Our dog was so happy romping in the yard, and the private hot tub felt nice & secluded even though there are several neighbors nearby. The location was great, and we enjoyed a hike along the Salmon River just a few miles away. Very wonderful spot on Mt Hood!

We really enjoyed our stay, the property is on such a beautiful lot and had all the amenities we needed.  The vacasa staff thinks of all the details and makes it all easy for you!

Very clean home tucked away in the woods in private corner of a group of homes. Short drive to all ski resorts at Mt. Hood. Nearby grocery store was convenient. Short power outage, but made for a good time under candle light.

Thank you!

Its been a rough couple of years for our family after the deaths of our 2 grandson's in an auto accident.  We were looking for a family get-away for Christmas that would make the holiday a bit easier for all of us but especially for our daughter. Kiwi's Creekside Cabin delivered.  We woke up Christmas morning to snow falling lightly outside and it fell softly all day--giving us the gift of a white Christmas.  When we arrived on Christmas eve there was tree all set up for us to put our presents under.  The cabin had plenty of room and the hot tub was a hit. The cabin was well equipped and we enjoyed our stay very much. Thank you.

Kiwi Cabin was a great retreat for my family. We stayed for a few nights and played on the mountian the entire time. The place was nicely furnished and had plenty of extra pilllows, blankets and coffee but the best part was the Hot tub which the kids I enjoyed.

Kiwi's Cabin was absolutely great!  Was looking for a place to get away with my girl and Vacasa provided everything we needed.  We threw a half-full cooler in the car and drove to Welches.  Upon arriving we were amazed to find everything we could possibly need.  There was even a Scrable game (our favorite, which we had forgotten at home).  It wasn't until we were making dinner on the second night that we discovered something, the only something, that the cabin was lacking:  a teaspoon.  But there was a half teaspoon measurement so it wasn't a problem at all.

Will definitely be renting from Vacasa again!

Upstairs shower window provides nice show to the neighbors

The house was in an area of vacation homes, but it was peaceful and quiet.  The way the houses were situated, it also felt private.  The house was well kept and clean.  Enjoyed the hot tub.

The inside of the cabin was very clean and everything you could need in the way of pots, pans, kitchen needs etc., plenty of towels and bathroom supplies etc.  The sofas are in dire need of replacement and we found ourselves sitting on flat cushions directly onto sagging springs and wooden frame. The cleanliness of the inside showed up the neglect of the outside and the outdoor furniture was in a filthy state.  Main complaint would be the feeling of dank, dismal darkness because of the trees completely overwhelming the property and very little sunshine actually broke through the tall barriers that were created.  The photographs definitely don't represent the real situation of the location either showing the real proximity of the trees or showing it is one of about 5 or 6 cabins very close together, being overlooked from all sides.  The trees have encroached upon the property since the photographs were taken and were very oppressive.  The hot tub is visible from the track and there were many cats/dogs just roaming freely which did cause a nuisance as they parked themselves on the deck daily.  The 'Creek' was virtually stagnant water which created further issues with mozzies making it unpleasant to sit outside.  The outside lighting on the decks was all PIR which meant you couldn't manage to have a continuous light on but constantly had to wave your arms or jump up and down to keep some light going.  There was no fire pit as advertised.

There was also lots of forestry work going on close by and well within earshot and on 3 days, the noise was extreme.

You needed to have lights on indoors during the day as it was so dark you could not do without.  Neither of the 2 double bedrooms had any central lights working and no means of changing the light bulbs as they were too high.  The very small bedside lights were not enough to be able to see at all.

The cabin fell below our expectations and is definitely not a place to go if you  hope to simply sit around relaxing on the decks and enjoying the lovely weather we had during our visit .  We had to go elsewhere to see any light or sunshine.  It was very uncomfortable in the darkness from 6.00pm when little light at all filtered through to it.

The surrounding trees need some thinning work doing on them to create at least a feeling that it is a summers day.

Not recommended.

The house is very nice and very clean.  Has a wonderful deck by the creek for meals, a smaller deck upstairs for relaxing, and a nice hottub (with privacy no less).  The kitchen is well-appointed and the dining room table spacious.  The twin beds bedroom downstairs perfect for little (or big!) children.

And the house is fun and attractive and not full of kitch!  We would love to go back there.  Carolyn Wallace

We had a blast at the house. It was close enough to the store and other activities but still felt secluded enough for privacy. We enjoyed the dogs that roamed the area, and they got along fine with our dogs. We had plenty of space for cooking and hanging out on the deck or in the hot tub. We will definitely go back.

Maybe get a flat screen for the living room. And the couch was uncomfortable. Otherwise great stay.  Thanks.

We stayed at this cabin for a long weekend, and it was wonderful.  It was close and easy to get to from Portland.  The scenery and the house were both beautiful.  My only complaint was that there were other houses very nearby, and several roaming (but friendly) dogs in the neighborhood.  Overall, we were very impressed.  The hot tub was probably the best part.

Charming A-frame right near golf, close to Mt. Hood skiing!

This charming and classic Welches vacation rental is a mid-century A-frame nestled near the Mt. Hood National Forest, but still adjacent to the main road for easy exploring. With it's one bedroom and loft, you'll have a space for up to eight guests and you can even bring along the family pets!

With a location that is sure to appeal to golfers, skiers, and outdoor adventurers alike, you'll be right near the Resort at the Mountain (literally steps away), for golfing at The Courses or a nice meal out at Altitude or Mallards.  Mt. Hood SkiBowl is only 17 miles away and in summer, it's the same distance to Trillium Lake for kayaking!

Inside this well-designed cabin, you'll find a comfortable floor plan with a cozy living room for relaxing after a day of hiking or skiing. Settle back on one of the plaid sofas (one is a sleeper sofa) for a night of cable TV or pop some popcorn and watch a movie on DVD.

The full kitchen has everything you'll need (even a dishwasher), so you can plan a hearty family meal or a festive brunch or two during your vacation. And when it's time to enjoy your feast, the dining table has seats for six and in the kitchen, there's an additional table. No matter if you're sitting down to pancakes in the morning or an after-dinner poker game, there are spots for everyone!

Out on the deck, you can admire the surrounding trees while you prepare steaks on the grill. There's plenty of outdoor seating for an al fresco meal or to admire the blooming rhododendrons.

Downstairs, there is one bedroom with a queen bed and deck access, as well as a full bathroom. Upstairs in the loft, you'll have an addition queen bed and two twin beds (trundle-style). On this upper level, there is also a private balcony - perfect for some quiet reading or a morning cup of coffee. This home will comfortably sleep up to eight guests and dogs are welcome for an additional fee.

Other amenities at this comfortable, retro cabin in the woods include WiFi,  three TVs, a private washer and dryer, and a poker set for game nights. And for the history buffs in your group - once upon a time, this historic A-frame was the gift shop for the resort next door.

This ideal location is right in the middle of all the happenings at the popular Resort at the Mountain! Schedule a game of golf, get a facial at the spa, or plan a special meal out. You'll also be near great hiking - the Hunchback Trailhead, the start of one of Oregon's steepest hikes, is only a couple of miles from your door.

Also just down the road are neighboring mountain towns like Rhododendron and Government Camp. In winter, head to Mt. Hood SkiBowl, Mt. Hood Meadows, or Timberline for a day on the ski slopes - all are within a 24-mile drive.

Come to ski, to hike, or just to relax at this comfortable and cozy Mt. Hood vacation rental!

It was a nice piece of property, loved the trees. Watch pets and children close when outside, people drive way too fast down the road right by the property.

This modern mountain lodge is a peaceful yet fun-filled spot to experience all the natural beauty and outdoors adventures Mt. Hood has to offer!

With exposed timber beams criss-crossing the vaulted ceilings, a spiral staircase leading up to a spacious loft, and a fireplace set into a wall of exposed brick, you know from the moment you enter that this lodge is something special. The living area is open and spacious, with windows overlooking the surrounding pine trees and a media center fully equipped for rainy days. Curl up on the sectional sofa by the fire with a movie on the TV, or power up the Wii for more interactive entertainment.

Behind the living area, the open floor plan continues to the dining area and roomy kitchen. The table for six sits near a potbelly stove for warm family dinners, with a few stools lining the breakfast bar in the kitchen. The chef in the family will appreciate the ample counterspace, perfect for making use of the cabinets' hearty supply of cooking gear and dinnerware. And yes, alert the dish-doer in the family that there is a dishwasher provided for easy clean-up! With the Thriftway in Welches only five miles away, you don't need to worry about packing in groceries (or even good beer!) for your trip to the mountain.

Through the living area's beautiful French doors is the master bedroom, with a queen bed, mirror-topped dressing table, and an attached bath. Up the spiral staircase is the spacious loft. There are two sleeping areas with another queen bed and a twin-over-full bunk, respectively, with a shared bathroom between them.

While the house itself is beautiful and relaxing, the backyard may be the biggest draw! There is a covered hot tub with plenty of room for four adults.  The grounds are large and fully fenced, providing a safe place for youngsters to build forts and play in the snow on winter days or take a ride on the zip line. There's also a barbeque, outdoor eating area, and a fire pit for roasting marshmallows on summer evenings. As part of the Timberline Rim community, the house even includes access to a seasonal swimming pool, tennis and basketball courts, and easy access to trails along the Sandy River.

Of course, Mt. Hood itself is the ultimate playground! Just minutes from the home is the Sandy Ridge Trail System, providing epic recreation opportunities for mountain bikers and hikers to explore the foothills of the Cascade Range. The historic Timberline Lodge is approximately 20 minutes away for your skiing, snowboarding, or very scenic hot chocolate-sipping. For the fisherman at heart, the Sandy River is a hop, skip, and a jump away, offering you world-class salmon and steelhead fishing. This river has gained a reputation among fly fishing enthusiasts as a very demanding arena to test the best of skills.

Summer or winter, Mt. Hood has something special for everyone, and the same goes for the Mountain Meadow Lodge. Book your next Mt. Hood adventure today!

Great experience, just wished the hot tub water was different. The swimming pool was fun.

We booked this house late in June and it was reasonable priced and in a great location. The Vacasa staff were awesome answering our questions. The place was well stocked with all the amenities we needed from cooking to enjoying family time around a board game. We were afforded the opportunity to check in early as well as check out late. Both were unheard of at other places we had stayed.  Great job! The neighborhood is very quite and we'll situated. I Would recommend this place to anyone and will be back myself!

We were beyond happy with the home and our stay. Everything we needed was there. We would stay again, for sure, if we're ever in the area again. Thank-you so much.

We definitely would recommend to stay here! House is cozy enough to create a great feeling of having a vacation. Hot tub is reasonable size to have 4 or 5 people at one time, maybe more but we had only 5 the most at one time and it was comfortable.

Enough utensils provided. They also have big Turkey plate and gravy boat. Really appreciate that as we stayed during the Thanksgiving and baked turkey.

I guess its a new dish washer.

One room with a queen bed was without a door (less privacy for couple), which that works even better for us because we need only one room upstairs. And the other 4 sleep downstairs. Plenty of space.

T

This property was clean well stocked and in a great location. Would stay there again if I'm in the area. Thanks

A very nice cozy, comfortable cabin. A few things, the TV is a bit dated, so if you want to connect a laptop to it, you would need HDMI, S-Video converters. Only one bedroom has a door, a little inconvenient if there are couples. However, the hot tub was great, the house was very comfortable and inviting, in spite of these drawbacks, we would still choose the place again. Very conveniently located.

WE were 6 ladies and a baby on an annual reunion weekend.  The house accommodated are needs well. We especially appreciated the well-equipped kitchen.  We didn't expect it to be in a residential community, but in the end it didn't matter as it was very quiet and neighbors seemed very welcoming.

This is a very spacious and open floor plan yet the right amount of privacy. We went with another couple and it worked out perfectly. We couldn't find pictures of the hot tub on the site but it is nice. Not super fancy but very comfortable for 4 and would be ok for 6 people. It is covered to keep the rain or snow off, just outside the back door, and in the elements of the peaceful woodsy backyard. Nice fire pit as well.

I'm very sensitive/picky when it comes to beds and I found the beds quite comfortable. The large sectional was a great place for the four of us to lounge around and play games. Could easily and comfortably seat 6. Kitchen was great, quiet neighborhood, not secluded but had a secluded feeling.

We enjoyed our stay very much ... Although we'd hoped for a snowy fun weekend ( no snow year ) we still had a great family vacation .

The cabin was warm and inviting. Everything worked and was well maintained.

We'd recommend to others

Relax and retreat into the mountain life with this gorgeous Government Camp vacation rental! With three bedrooms, a private hot tub, and old-school interior, you'll fit right into the Mt. Hood life.

Sure, there are tons of things to do in Government Camp any time of year, but let's face it - it's mostly about the skiing and snowboarding! Ever since Peter Sickler started the first ski run on Multopor Mountain back in 1928, skiing has grown in Government Camp, and nowadays you can choose from world-class slopes at Timberline Lodge, SkiBowl, and Mt. Hood Meadows. This charming cabin, with room for six in the middle of Government Camp, has witnessed much of that growth. From its subtle gingerbread facade outside to the ski memorabilia throughout the interior - this is a place that's seen many skiers come and go, and it wants you to know it.

After a day on the slopes, tuck away the boots, the skis, and the down jackets and hang out in the living room on the comfy leather love seat and sofa. You can recount your downhill daring by the warmth of the propane wood stove in a lodge-like ambiance filled with wood-trussed ceilings, old mugs, and a roughhewn log support that holds up the decor more than the house. But it's not all about nostalgia, this place has some bells and whistles! You'll be able to watch your favorite flicks with the DVD player, shows on the TV with cable, or check your email or make a reservation using the WIFI.

With plenty of room in the fully stocked kitchen, your designated chef(s) will have no problem whipping up a meal for hungry vacationers anxious to hit the slopes, or tired from being on them all day. And when you gather around the wooden table to enjoy your meal, nostalgia looms large in the wonderful, wrap-around collage filled with images of skiing and skiers gone by.

This cozy 1,000 sq ft cabin sleeps six, and features three unique and creative bedrooms. The master bedroom is a large bedroom with bright walls, a queen-size bed and space to spread out all your warm winter wear.  The second bedroom has a classic ski cabin look and features a full bed that is great for a second couple. The third bedroom is a fun, sunlit room with cozy quilts that cover two twin beds - perfect for the kids. All three bedrooms are on the second floor of the home, and the two bathrooms are downstairs.

Government Camp is pretty cool in the summer too, so this cabin is a wonderful place to lounge all year round. There are historic sites like Barlow Trail and Timberline Lodge, and 25 trails around Government Camp for hiking, biking, or just strolling in a beautiful, alpine environment. The Sandy River is nearby, so you can indulge your love of fishing, rafting, kayaking...anything you can do in the summer! Check out one of the five great places to eat in Government Camp or visit some of the shops you'll also find there. Plus, the adorable town of Hood River is just 45 minutes away, so any shopping, dining or bar-hopping you're interested in can be easily done there!

When you stay at Wilcox Cabin, be prepared for fun and the feeling of an old-school cabin in the lovely Mt. Hood forest!

Note: The stairs are steep and the bedrooms are upstairs, bathrooms are on the main Level.

This little cabin is so adorable and wonderful!!! Right in the heart of govt camp, perfect location! We had a maintenance issue and a repairman came within 10 minutes of calling to fix it, amazing service. Hot tub is grrat, beds are super comfy, kitchen is well stocked! We highly recommend vacasa and the Wilcox haus!!

Cozy, nice kitchen and bedrooms.  Will easily sleep 6, with a 7th on the couch downstairs.  Parking out front for 2 vehicles.  Just a few steps to the Govt Camp shopping strip.

The cabin was really cozy and the beds were really comfortable

Handy location for walking into Government Camp.  Cabin was clean and as pictured.   Overall, it could stand a bit of updating and maybe foam toppers on bed, but for a true cabin experience it will take you back to grandma's country house!  We enjoyed it and would go again.

I thought the cabin was quaint and booked it. As it turns out, I should have spent a little more money and gotten a more updated place to stay. Here's why: The shower head is pathetic...it is a slow dribble. Most electrical outlets upstairs are not functional. The hot tub temperature control will not go above the preset 101F and the temp gradually cooled when we were in it.  The stairs to the bedrooms are very narrow.

Loved everything about the whole experience. Can't wait to stay again

Our stay at the Wilcox cabin was very cozy and relaxing. It was fully furnished with plenty of appliances/tools to prepare meals in the kitchen. Beds were comfortable, and the living space perfect for games around the fire. Conveniently located, close to the local store and restaurants. The hot tub Is small but it works! Definitely hope we get to come stay again!

Nice, older property close to everything with most of the comforts you'd expect.

Neat classic old ski cabin. Great wallpaper in the kitchen with lots of plates, pots and other kitchen gear.  Also loads of space in Living Room, and a nice gas stove.

we had a blast and the wilcox cabin is perfect! the coffee maker leaked everytime it was used.  Would be nice to have a larger trash receptacle and one for recycling.  Thanks for the great time!

This secluded, riverfront Parkdale vacation rental is the perfect place to stay while you enjoy the beauty and serenity of nature. With 1.3 acres of land that backs up to the spectacular Hood River, a pet-friendly attitude, and a private hot tub, you will surely have an amazing vacation here!

Located about two miles north of the small, charming town of Parkdale, this home is a quick drive away from small markets and a few restaurants, but you may want to spend all your time at the riverfront vacation house, surrounded by the great outdoors.

With three bedrooms (plus a loft) and two bathrooms, this home has plenty of space for eight guests to vacation here. You are even welcome to bring your dogs along with you! Though a $10 per-pet, nightly fee with a $40 minimum per stay does apply, your furry friends will love sniffing around the property, chasing squirrels, and splashing around in the shallows of the river.

Head inside to discover vaulted ceilings, wooden walls, and a warm, homey atmosphere. The spacious living area has plenty of seating arranged around the cozy river rock fireplace, as well as large windows that offer views of the forested surroundings. With a VHS player, DVD player, and Internet access, guests will have plenty of electronic entertainment in case you wind up needing a break from the quiet of nature!

Bring along groceries and enjoy home-cooked meals during your stay! The full kitchen has all the tools and equipment you may need to prepare food, as well as plenty of space so multiple chefs can maneuver easily. Sit down at the dining room table or the more casual breakfast bar and enjoy a nice meal together before heading out to wade in the river or explore the forest.

The master bedroom has a huge king-size bed where you will sleep soundly. A second bedroom has a soft queen-size bed, and the final bedroom has a twin trundle bed and a full-size bed. Upstairs in the loft area is an additional fold-out futon, so altogether eight guests will have comfortable and warm places to rest at night.

The loft also serves as a fun playroom: watch TV, play foosball, or bring some board games to spread out on the floor. This would be a fantastic area for any children to play while the adults chat in front of the fireplace downstairs. And, with a laundry room, you won't have to worry about anyone getting their clothes dirty while exploring the area.

Outside, the deck is a peaceful place to sit, soak in some sunshine, and enjoy the sound of the breeze rustling through the trees. If you're very still, you may even see a deer walk by! Use the gas grill to cook up a casual lunch of burgers, or step into the private hot tub and let all your troubles melt away in the bubbling water.

With the beautiful Hood River just past your doorstep, you and your guests will love to spend time on your private beach area enjoying the sunshine, wading in the shallower sections of water, and even fishing! You will also enjoy exploring the 1.3 acres of property and looking for wildlife, all while listening to the rippling river and birds singing nearby.

In Parkdale proper, you will have a few small markets to stock up on the basics and a handful of restaurants, including excellent house-made craft beer and pizza at Solera Brewery. For even more options, drive 15 minutes north to the city of Hood River, where you will find many eateries, shops, and activities. And, with Mt. Hood just 30 miles away, you could take a scenic summer drive or a winter trip to enjoy some skiing!

This secluded, peaceful, and spacious Hood River vacation rental is a great place to relax and enjoy your getaway while surrounded by the beauty of nature!

Our family came to the area for my sister's wedding in Parkdale. This house was thoroughly clean and fully equipped for preparing meals. The location was quiet and private. We enjoyed using the patio, grill, hot tub, swing set and exploring the creek. Next time we would bring water shoes for the whole family to splash in the creek. We did have one maintenance issue come up - the refrigerator wasn't cooling well. Within an hour of calling Vacasa there was a maintenance man who came to clean the coils on the fridge and also delivered a large mini-fridge in case the cleaning didn't resolve the problem. I loved how the focus of this house was creating a family friendly environment - with cozy and functional furniture throughout. Only two minor drawbacks of the stay was no high chair for our toddler and the automatic ice maker did not function.

Loved the placed. The extra fridge was great. Hot tub was fantastic. Loved the fire pit. Secluded and next to a stream that you can go for a dip in. Parking was abundant and the price was fair.

My only complain came on the last day at 8am when the lawn and outdoor maintenance crew showed up while we were still there and enjoying both our seclusion and the quite morning. This is something that should take place once we've left.

Other than that I loved the place and would highly recommend it!

The cabin feel, the remoteness of the location, the privacy, and the sound of the river in the background really made this a wonderful place to stay.  I am already planning on my next trip.  The house was in great shape.  We were even greeted by a friendly peacock on our second morning.  Highly recommended.

This place is a little gem near Mt. Hood. Very well maintained, great for a family vacation. The cabin had everything we needed for a two night stay: hotbub, gas grill, fully equipped kitchen, abundant supply of firewood with a bonfire pit. Would love to come back for  a longer stay next time.

If you want and need to get out of the fast paced and noisy city, this house should be considered, it is  very well apointed and comfortable. You can stay connected if need be but the surroundings and sound of the river will remind you of why you are there. We skied on Saturday and then enjoyed a drive down hwy 35  and then through the blooming orchards under the warm sun, it was stunning. There are a couple of great spots in Parkdale that offer a great beers and good food.  Once back at the River Bend home you can sit back and relax in true comfort. It  truely is a great spot!

I just stayed at this beautiful home. I was looking for a more secluded space and it was in a perfect location. The location is only about a 1.5 hour drive from Portland and for a weekend away from the hustle and bustle it was the perfect spot. I loved how close I was to a lot of hiking areas and while I was there went on the Tamanawas fall hike, which was only a 15 minute drive from the home. When I arrived the home was very clean and they have anything you might need pots and pans and utensil wise in the kitchen. I had a wonderful weekend and will definitely book this home again in the future

Let this lovely and reasonably priced three bedroom chalet vacation rental be your gateway to all the activities available in and around the 28-acre, Collins Lake Resort. Just a one minute drive to downtown Government Camp, this lovely chalet vacation rental has amenities like a 50' flat screen, DVD, and access to Collins Lake amenities. Nestled between majestic Mount Hood to the north, and the three peaks dubbed Tom, Dick, and Harry to the south, the condos at Collins Lake are described by Frommer's Travel Guide  as "spacious" and "luxurious," and the resort is acclaimed as one of the acclaimed getaway spots on the scenic Mount Hood Byway.

In summer, step into the verdant expanse right outside your door. Follow the miles of interpretive trails through the old growth forest that weave around Collins Lake and stop for a picnic at one of the many picnic areas that punctuate the trail. Winter sports aficionados will feel at home here too: Slip the car into the roomy garage and you'll find a ski cleaning area complete with a wax iron, so it's perfect for getting ready for the slopes!

Don't forget to bring some DVDs; otherwise, you'll miss the experience of watching your favorite movies on the huge, 50-inch flat screen TV. Pick a spot, and sink into one of the plush couches that line the wall. Click on the gas fireplace, grab that article you were reading or bring up the laptop on the free WIFI. Relax! Make a cup of coffee or tea and step out on the balcony for some fresh air. This is your time away, so indulge your senses as the smell of the brew wafts up and mixes with the aroma of the Douglas firs in front of you, and your eyes gather filtered glimpses of the mountain through the pines.

Hungry? Weather permitting, you can follow the walking trails the short distance into nearby Government Camp where you'll find four restaurants that cater to a variety of tastes. If you're staying in for dinner, just head into the fully stocked kitchen that's up to the challenge of any culinary skill. The dining table seats six with three more padded stools at the bar so everyone can be comfortable.

When it's time for bed, head upstairs. The master bedroom has a queen bed and a private bathroom. Watch a late night talk show on the cable TV or nod off to a DVD. There's a second bedroom with another queen bed and a TV. Kids can have the bunk bed in the third bedroom; it also has a TV. (Don't let them stay up too late!) There are two full bathrooms and a half-bath as well.

Guests at this lodge are just steps away from the Collins Lake clubhouse with its grand Cascadian stone fireplace  -  the perfect place to enjoy that novel. Or, bring your towel and trunks and slip into the hot tub, the soothing steam of the sauna, or take a dip in the year-round pool. (The decks are heated!) Notwithstanding all the fun things to do at the resort itself, Government Camp is the perfect headquarters for your forays into summer or winter fun. Lots of hiking and biking trails near this chalet. Skiers can take advantage of the Vacasa special at Mount Hood Meadows, or head over to any of the five ski areas nearby. Whatever you like to do, there's something for you in the Government Camp, Mount Hood area!

(Sorry, no pets allowed in this unit.)

My husband and I had a great visit here with my parents and our two kids.  Our littlest is barely 16 months, so we brought our own baby gates to keep him from falling down the stairs.  Our older son loved the bunk beds, although there is no door on that room as it is not really a bedroom despite being used for that purpose (no door, no closet, no window).  Kitchen was well equipped with utensils and pans, etc.  The condo is lovely and feels fairly private, especially considering that it is not an end unit.  We never heard the neighbors at all.

Would have been great if there had been snow, but that's obviously not the fault of the rental itself.  We enjoyed our visit and would definitely consider staying there again.

If you show up and it it a heat wave, this unit has no A/C so prepare for a very hot night.  If the weather is normal, you will be fine.  The lock box for the key to the unit is situated on the frame of the garage.  Instructions were a bit confusing about where the key was located.

Had a great stay. Clean unit with a little dated carpet. The one window was priceless.  I recommend this unit and will try to rent again.

Everything was good, except it takes some time in the morning of departure to strip sheets, run towels in washer, and take out trash and recycling.  Overall, we had a nice time.

Visited for 4 days w/4 adults and 2 kids, loved this condo. It had everything we needed. We loved the comfortable couch in the living room and the enormous TV was a treat. We cooked all our meals in the well stocked kitchen. We also liked the grill on the deck overlooking the trees and a small stream. You can hear Hwy 26 through the trees but you can't really see it and it didn't bother us at all. The services at Collins Lake are great - everyone loved the therapy pool in the trees. We went there every day for a soak after skiing at Timberline.  The beds were very comfortable and the linens excellent (though the upper bunk in the space off the hall felt a bit unstable, even for a small person). We highly recommend this condo and would happily book here again.

This chalet is nicely furnished, equipped in the kitchen and spices a plenty.  Wonderful relaxing visit.

We were here from Florida visiting family in Oregon and decided to spend a couple of days on the mountain.  The location of the condo was close to everything we wanted to do.  This unit had a very nice nature view from the patio.  It snowed the day we left, and the parking lot was being cleared early in the day to make an easy exit.  The large hot tub in the woods was great.  We were not expecting the amount of stairs in the unit, but the modern furnishing, soft beds and large kitchen made up for it.  Had some trouble getting the remote controls to work, but otherwise, everything else was perfect.  Would definitely stay here again.

The condo was very clean and had all the necessary items, we would stay here again!

We loved staying in this home.  It was kept very nice and we had plenty of space and felt very comfortable.  I will stay here again.  The home is beautiful and the kitchen was awesome!  We spent a majority of our time cooking and eating and watching TV since the slopes weren't open.  The only thing I'd recommend is bringing a pillow top for the bed as it was a little hard.  Other than that, the home was perfect for what we wanted.  Thank you!

I spent a lot of time looking over condos in the Government Camp area, and this was my favorite (for amenities and price).  Then once we got there, it was even better than the pictures and description shared.  My girlfriends and family LOVED this place!  We plan on coming back in the future if it is still available!

Nicely appointed unit in convenient location. The space was perfect for our six person group. Really enjoyed the complex with the pool and jaccuzzi as well. Nice to have a grill on the deck and the fireplace kept the place toasty. Sometimes too hot but better than being cold I guess.... Overall the unit was clean and well stocked and the staff at Vacasa really were friendly and helpful! The lift ticket discount was super awesome too! Thank you for a wonderful stay!

We loved it.  Very clean and roomy.  The only thing we could say negative, was we didn't realize that there were two thermostats controlling the house and it was very hot upstairs and hard to sleep.  Once we figured that out, everything was fantastic.  We will for sure go back.  It is very conveniently located.

We loved the stay, the place,and the customer service we received here. Would definitely recommend to others.

This is a beautiful condo.  Modern, comfy and immaculate.  We stayed here while visiting the Mt. Hood area. Its location was perfect for exploring the surrounding sites and hikes we were interested in.  The only issue (a minor issue) was that you can hear the highway and we weren't able to sleep with the windows open.

This apartment complex is in a great location to take advantage of Mt Hood and the surrounding areas. The apartment itself is very well appointed, was very clean and well set up for a family holiday. The pool and hot tub in the complex were great for the family and we enjoyed using the BBQ on the back deck.

Made the entire trip an excellent experience.  Excellent place and very well kept.  Will be definitely coming back again!

We loved that there was a TV/DVD in every room....the kids got to enjoy movies while the adults were downstairs.  The property was clean and the kitchen was fully sticked, which was great for us since we like to cook.  We enjoyed this location very much and will hopefully get the same property next year.  The management was very helpful, laidback and accomodating.  The cleaning ladies were very sweet!  Thank you!

This is a wonderful condo.  I would have rated it all five stars if the fireplace was working.

Please improve on master bedroom mattress. Very uncomfortable when two are inthe bed. Otherwise this unit is perfect! Looking forward to another visit.

Quintessential cabin in the woods with stunning views

Step back into a simpler era at this cozy 1920's Mt. Hood vacation rental cabin! Surrounded by cedars trees and just a short walk from the ZigZag River, you may find that time moves a little slower as you curl up by the fireplace here at Old Smokey Cabin.

The most peaceful mornings begin with a mug of hot coffee on the porch in the fresh mountain air. Spend your days strolling through the quiet wooded neighborhood, along the river, or head up to the ski slopes for an adventurous winter's day (Skibowl is only 15 minutes from your door, with Timberline and Mt. Hood Meadows just a bit further). In the evenings, wind down by the fireplace, surrounded by exposed timber beams and rustic decor in the exceptionally cozy living room.

Despite feeling delightfully slow-paced and relaxing, this charming vacation rental home does come equipped with many modern amenities. The kitchen has all the expected appliances, including a dishwasher for easy clean-up and plenty of countertop gadgets like a waffle iron and slow-cooker. A grocery store is less than two miles away in Welches, so you won't need to worry about hauling food up to the mountain. The dining table is tucked just off the kitchen for sit-down meals, and the patio has a gas grill for warm-weather barbecues.

When it comes to technology, you'll find two modest television sets with cable, along with a cabinet of DVDs for movie nights. Wireless Internet access is provided as well.

The lower level of this rustic vacation rental home has the living room with both a propane stove and wood-burning fireplace, the kitchen, and the dining area. There are also two bedrooms downstairs, both with queen beds, and the full bathroom. Upstairs, the loft has both a twin and full bed, and a sitting area that's perfect for kids to hang out, play board games, or watch their own movie selection.

This vacation rental home is perfect for a cozy winter retreat or ski weekend, but it's also fantastic in warmer weather. The surrounding area is full of hiking trails and fishing holes, and the pet-friendly cabin has a wonderful fenced backyard for the family dog. With the ZigZag River just a short walk away, your four-legged companion might think he's found paradise!

Indeed, after a few days of enjoying the simpler pace of life only found in a cozy mountain cabin like Old Smokey, your only problem may be convincing your family to leave!

Our little cabin served its purpose. Our Wheaten loved that she could walk out the door and be in a fenced yard. The kids loved the loft and the nearby river. Too warm for a wood fire but the gas fireplace was nice in the mornings for a quick warm up...

We enjoyed very much being together and there was ample room to do that and still have privacy if we wanted it.  We loved the cabin and felt very warm and cozy nestled in the woods.

All in all it was so pleasant staying in the woods with the rain and quiet environment. The cabin is from the 20's so it's fun imagining the era of that time. There is pretty much everything you need so it's very comfortable.

This cabin was so prefect it let u have a lil of the past the way it was build and maintain and furniture was just to top it off the beds are so comfy.  Also lots of room for our four paws  family to run and play.thanks for letting us stay in your home. The Eichstadt family

We had a great time at the Old Smokey Cabin.  It lived up to its name once we got a good fire going with the smell and sound of crackling wood and an electric wood burning stove for heating (which did an excellent job).  The cabin is comfortable and inviting.  It is bigger than the pictures and even from the look outside.  Perfect for our family of 8 (7 adults and 1 small child).

I loved that it felt like we were in an old-fashioned cabin, but had all the modern amenities (wifi, TV, full kitchen and bathroom).  I can imagine that the house and surrounding areas are even more picturesque in the snow and we are already trying to find a time to come again as a family to enjoy the cabin in the winter.

A short walk to the Zigzag river and quick drives to many beautiful hikes.  The only note I have for future guests to the be careful as you walk down the stairs from the second to first floor (especially at night and when tired).  Since the house was built in the 1920s, the stairs are smaller than modern stairs and if you don't watch your step you can slip.  My sister slid down the stairs (but she also had just taken the red-eye from New York--so a combination of stairs and tiredness).

All-in-all great space and time!

The house was great, loved the location as far as distance from Mt. Hood & Zig Zag River. Extremely short walk to the river, plenty of more private locations if you walk down the trail. My major problem was just how close the neighbors were in the backyard. I assume it's another vacation home and there was a family with about 8+ people including a bunch of kids. I wouldn't recommend this location for a romantic getaway, maybe a small family vacation.

Our family really enjoyed the cabin and we plan to come back again.

The place and the ubication is nice, tha cabin is perfect, the location to. The house is a little cold all the time. Is difficult to come in to the cabin, they had a a box with keys inside and no one told us.

This place is impossible to heat! We stayed when the average temp was 40, with all the space heaters, wood stove and fire blazing we were still cold. There was mouse droppings next to the dining room cabinet. The upstairs bedroom floor shakes when you walk, a child could fall between the railings.  This is a great location and maybe a good place to stay in the summer. Not for kids

In light of the disappointing experience we had, I would not rent from this company in the future.

The house itself was beautifully rustic and furnished as such.  The kitchen was very functional, well-stocked and fun to cook several family meals in.  The fireplace was amazing, with river rock stone and the loft was a great feature.  The three star rating is for the following:

1) The house was FREEZING when we got there...50 or so degrees.  Because the only heat sources in the entire house are the small gas stove, the fire place and several plug-in radiators, we were never able to get the house above 60 degrees on the first night.  Had it only been my husband and me, this would not have been such a problem, but we had our children with us.  All four of us ended up having sleep in the great room, near the fireplace, just to stay warm.  So, in other words, we would have been just as comfortable in a hotel room with a kitchen.

2) I would say this house is appropriate for families with children who aren't walking yet, or over the age of 5.  Our toddler loved the loft, but needed constant supervision around the upstairs landing and staircase.

Overall, I'd give this house a 3-star rating.  I'd stay again, but only during the warmer months and not with small (mobile) children.

This is not the Taj Mahal  resort, but  with a few minor improvements which I suggested, it is still a fun, quiet, small cabin if peace and quiet are what you're seeking.  Nice setting.

We liked the lofts and the inside "bridge" between the lofts.  The main room was really cool.

The kitchen was also spacious.

This cabin is the perfect getaway....  feels like you are far away from PDX, but it's only an hour away.  It is stocked with everything a person could possibly need for a comfortable, cozy stay.  All you need to bring is your own food and be ready to relax and breath in the clean forest air.

This was the serenity we all needed.

Went with 6 friends for a weekend at the cabin.  All of us fell in love the moment we walked in.  The pictures on the website are VERY accurate.  This place had great charm and felt like home.  There was plenty of space for everyone and all the amenities.  We cooked each meal and had plenty of kitchen tools to do so. As can be expected of a a cabin built in the 20's, it was a little chilly at times, so if you are prone to feeling cold, bring your slippers and warmer pjs.  Once the fire and gas stove get roaring, it's cozy.  All of us debated on whether to put up a review because we want to keep Old Smokey a hidden gem among "fancier" rentals you find online.

My friends and I spent a weekend at the Smokey Cabin. It was a GREAT location for a relaxing weekend with friends! There was plenty of room for all 8 of us, it was clean, well maintained, and surrounded by beautiful trees! We really enjoyed our stay, and look forward to coming back!

Thank you so much Vacasa! It was so easy to plan this getaway. The cabin was even better than the pictures and description stated. It is fully stocked with all the kitchen gear you'll ever need and lots of spices and condiments. The beds were comfortable and everything was clean and tidy. We had a great time.

Really enjoyable ski weekend for two families. The cabin is very sweet and has lots of historical charm.  The kitchen is remarkably well set up and had every possible implement we could wish (and we cooked for 5 nights).  Wonderful upstairs area and "bridge" that our kids loved. Thank you.

We love'd the cabin very much and the area was beautiful.  Our 2 labs loved it just as much too :-)

This cabin has a great layout, works well for a group of 8 people or less.  Beautiful, peaceful setting helps you unplug and unwind.  Love that you can hear the river from the upstairs bedroom if you leave the window open a bit.

Cozy and comfortable cabin in a wonderful location near Mt. Hood!

This house was enjoyed by all. It has so much character, and lent itself perfectly to our needs. Well equipped and comfortable (beds were comfortable with plenty of extra blankets on chilly days and nights too), I would recommend this spot to anyone and everyone. I'm even thinking of bringing my family back during the summer, I enjoyed it so much!

We were very happy with the cabin!  It was much roomier than we expected, plenty of space for two couples and our son.  We loved the short walk to the river.  Thank you, we had a lovely time!

We stayed at this cabin for 3 days and it was wonderful! It slept 8 people comfortably, was always nice and warm, great fireplace, really cozy and cute! I'd recommend this place for sure.

The fireplace is delightful place to curl up in front of and play games for hours!  This home would be perfect for one family, and worked quite well for the two families we had.  The fenced yard was great for our dog.  The walk to the river is easy, enjoyable and beautiful.

This cabin was so well stoked with spices, teas, coffee that we played a little game called, "do they have....fill in the blank"......I ended up making a cake with supplies on hand. We had a rough start to our day but as soon as we entered the cabin a joyful mood was had by all. I would also like to say that I won at Monopoly.

We loved our experience at the Old Smokey Cabin! It was the perfect cabin experience. We also had a very good experience with Vacasa. I have already had one friend ask where I found this cabin at because of the awesome experience we had. I would definitely recommend the Old Smokey Cabin, or renting through Vacasa at any of their rentals!

Beautiful vintage cabin with everything you could possibly need.  So much character & far enough off of Hwy 26 that you don't hear the traffic, only the river.  Close enough to Ski Bowl & Timberline that it was only minutes to play in the snow.  Peaceful & relaxing!

My wife and I we're very happy with the cabin. It was very well stocked with all the essentials and more. The overall ambiance was great and exactly what we were looking for. The rock fireplace was just like the one I had as a kid. (Bring lots of firewood). Most of the windows were still the leaded glass and that was cool. The fenced back yard is great for the dog! Get instructions for the "WAVE TV" we didn't have any, but hey, we brought books and enjoyed the reading and playing games!

So bring your family or group, your well-behaved dog, your equipment, your cookbooks and your appetite and enjoy a stay at the colorful and fun-filled Collins Lake condos in Government Camp.

I so appreciate people who are willing to rent to dog owners. The dogs seem to relax us and give such great companionship on a vacation. I was impressed with so many dog stations  though it looks like plenty of people did not use it.

The chefs  condo had really nice dishes ,pans and appliances. The furniture was very comfortable. The  bedding was really  nice.

Three bathrooms was a great luxury as well. The garage was quite a surprise for loading and unloading the car out of the weather.

Loved the spot!   Karen and her dog maggi

Beautiful property in a great location. Very close to Ski Bowl, Timberline Lodge, Mt. Hood Meadows, and dozens of picturesque snowshoeing/cross-country skiing trails (we recommend White River Canyon). Hope to stay here again soon.

The place is very clean and has everything in the kitchen.  The only comment is that it is noisy at night. It seems that this is not the only unit that may have this problem as I read other reviews of different units. The location is really close to the highway and of course the density of buildings and units is high. So if it's not the highway noise then it's people outside having fun...so falling asleep was a bit tough.

Plan to stay again next year.

Clean, well equipped and in a great location.

Very easy to book online and no hassle check in!

LL

Too many stairs for a day after the mountain!

Though we had to call the staff frequently due to door lock problems, they always responded helpfully, always positive, and when maintenance came out, he was SUPER nice as well.  The staff makes things easy.  Our house and stay was great aside from the lock issue.

Overall good experience. Just a few minor surprises: probably the worst disappointment was,inside the Monty Python and the Holy Grail DVD case (part of the owner's collection) was a instead a movie called "Funky Monkey"!

We LOVED our vacation! The condo was fabulous! We'll be back!

Cozy loft tucked in the woods near Govy!

This unique one bedroom loft is a wonderfully romantic yet affordable getaway, close to all the shops and restaurants of Government Camp. Those who like a little more peace and quiet, though, will delight in the home's location on a large private lot with two streams running past.

The loft is located above the garage of an attached home, allowing you to enjoy your own little retreat.

The space has been brilliantly designed to accommodate up to four people, and feels larger than its 600 square feet! In the main living area, a comfy loveseat sits before a TV with DVD player for cozy movie nights.

On the opposite end of the space, the fully remodeled kitchen has all the essentials: full-sized fridge, oven, dishwasher, microwave, coffeemaker, blender, and all the pots and pans, dinnerware, and cooking utensils you might need to prepare meals. The four-person table is perfect for sharing meals or even using as a workspace (wireless Internet is also included in your stay!).

The spacious bedroom has a comfortable queen bed and a ladder leading up to the loft. Younger guests will love climbing up to their own private space each night, and two twin mattresses with fresh linens and warm blankets provide a cozy spot to sleep under the sloped wood-beam ceiling! It's almost like camping in a pup tent -- except, of course, for the nicely appointed bathroom with tub/shower combo. And if one of your extra guests prefers not to climb a ladder, the living area's love seat unfolds into a comfy sleeper sofa as well.

The loft is within easy walking distance of all the attractions in Government Camp, like freshly-brewed pints at the Ice Axe and gear rental at one of the shops in town. Skibowl, of course, is only a bit further across Highway 26, and Timberline is just a 20-minute drive away. The property also sits quite near the base of Mount Hood's historic Glade Trail for a little more out-of-the-ordinary exploration.

We stayed here based on the other infant/toddler friendly reviews, and it didn't disappoint! In fact, as soon as we opened the door, there were a couple of little race cars toys waiting for my son. We explored and eventually made our way to the loft attic. The ladder was steep, but not impossible for our almost two-year old. Actually, after we got back from our hike and dinner, I left the room for a second and he was already half way up. That being said, be sure not to leave a curious wee ones unattended, or remember to shut the door to the bedroom.

But all in all, a great stay and will definitely come again. Thank you!

This loft is cute,clean and convenient...BUT the AD for is a total farce. There is NO hot tub. The WiFi ONLY works some of the time...and there is NOTHING stocked at the house. Bring garbage sacks and ANY cooking stuff you need.

Overall clean and in great condition.

We met the owners of the house who were very nice and gave us some recommendations on things to do :)

The only down sides are the hot tub is not for guest use (as advertised in the description) and the mattress in the main bedroom was uncomfortable. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay.

I travelled down with my two boys whom where attending Summer snowboard camp for the week and it was perfect for us. Close to everything, super clean and made for a great low stress week. Can't wait for next year.

Stayed for 2 nights with our 10 month old. Pretty baby proof! The bedroom is quite large, and the loft is too. The ladder up to the loft is very steep so I'd recommend for adults or older children only. But it is extremely spacious, and you could put the two single mattresses together to make another double bed, plus a few more in sleeping bags if required :) The only negative was that the hot water heater wasn't on when we arrived and it took quite some time to figure out why we weren't getting a hot shower in the am. Vacasa staff was very helpful in resolving the problem, kudos to them as I was quite grumpy about it. The trail system access a half block away is great.

We needed an affordable and comfortable place to stay for a couple of nights close to Timberline Lodge for a friend's wedding, and Lindberg Loft fit the bill. My husband and I were travelling with our infant son, so the fully equipped kitchen was so helpful for storing and preparing his milk

and baby foods. The bedroom was large with plenty of room for a portable crib and our luggage.

(Note that this property doesnt provide cribs; we had to rent one in Portland.) The furnishings appear to be quite new and are nearly all from Ikea. The loft bedroom is accessed through the main bedroom via a very steep ladder. In the loft there is a gate that can be closed to prevent the occupants from accidentally falling down the ladder. You could sleep another two people up there, but given the ladder steepness I wouldn't recommend the loft bedroom for young children.  Once you make a reservation Vacasa emails specific instructions about how to enter the rental. Even so, we were puzzled when we arrived about where to find the proper entrance (we didn't want to accidentally enter the owner's portion of the house). After a few minutes we figured out that the instructions were correct--we had to go "around back" on the unpaved rocky path behind the house. This was a little difficult with a large suitcase because we couldn't roll it. So, come prepared to carry your luggage a few rugged yards to a back porch and then up the stairs in the garage to reach the entrance to the unit. Overall, this was a minor inconvenience. We enjoyed our stay and would love to return someday when the kid is older to better enjoy some outdoor activities.

Very fun and enjoyable space, it was great to come home to after our days of hiking and exploring the area. Well equipped kitchen. We would love to come back!

Great location for Skibowl East or West.  Perfect for a ski trip with a nice kitchen and Government Camp grocery store two minutes away.  We appreciate contemporary design and loved the Ikea style finishes.  Living area only accommodates two people, but we weren't there to watch TV.  Kitchen table seats four.  The high ceilings keep it from feeling cramped.  The two futons in the loft are separated by the ladder area, so even teenagers fit fine up there (our son is 13 and tall) as long as they like climbing ladders.  We were worried about recurring sickness causing us to lose the whole cost of the weekend, but loved Vacasa's $30 "insurance" for just such an occurrence.

Located just off the main road, the location is perfect. A quick walk to several trails or turn the other way for town. Great new kitchen and large spacious bedroom. There is a loft with two twin mattresses on the floor (not real beds). The living area is very small and outdated. It wouldn't suit more than two people. Also, the hot tub is NOT private like the ad says. It is shared with the owners of the home and their living room looks right out on it. The place has a lot of potential but is lacking the allure of other condos in the area. For those that want a very quiet stay this is a nice spot but shop around first.

The kids can test their dexterity on the "The Simpsons" and "The Family Guy" pinball machines, the PlayStation, or the arcade games ("Golden Tee" and "Extreme Hunter").

The house is all on one level so it is easily accessible for anyone with mobility problems. There are two full bathrooms, one with a shower stall and one with a tub and shower set up.

If you've got doggie with you, there's a 20-foot dog run in the back. There's even a pen big enough for horses so you can ride on the many trails around the area. As you would expect, the Molalla River Corridor is loaded with river-related activities like rafting and fishing. But Molalla is also known for its famed "Buckeroo Rodeo" where cowboys and cowgirls can tighten their chaps and test their equestrian skills with varying events beginning in April and ending in September. But that's not all! There are five city parks in Molalla, one devoted to skateboarders. Did you ever want to try sky-diving? Well, you can do that in Molalla too. But you have to come here first. Call and reserve your spot at this great lodge today!

This was a very cool place to stay for the week. Big open views, right on the river, it was better than the pictures showed. I definitely plan on coming back for future trips!

Beautiful place. We had a wedding to go to, and this place was wonderful for a bbq and get together. nice rooms. Games were fun for groomsmen. We had a visit from the hot tub pool cleaner guy - the first day - who did an excellent job. Kitchen is wonderfully supplied - lots of everything you need to cook. Two fridges are a bonus.

The house perfectly fit our needs for a nice retreat with friends.  This house is great for dogs as they love playing in the river and in the big fenced portion of the yard.  We also got to take in a nice little hike at Butte Creek Falls which is about 30 minutes away.  It is not as well known as Silver Falls but it is certainly equally stunning!

We loved this house! Basically the deck and the living room feel like one big space. So much fun to be had here. Family guy and Simpsons are two of my favorite pinball machines and they were in good shape so thats rad. We had an epic charcuterie spread one night and the kitchen had all the serving bowls and little plates we needed.... so its an awesome house to cook and do it up right!

One thing... it says it sleeps 10 but theres only 6 spots on beds... the rest are either couch or air mattress.

My family and I loved your Beautiful home on the river. We will be coming back again. :)

This property was fabulous.  The large open living space was perfect for getting together as a group and playing games and chatting.  The arcade games were a hit, as was the poker table.  While the bedrooms were small, the space was clean and comfortable.  Plenty of supplies - sheets, towels, blankets, games, movies, and books.  The outside living space was amazing.  We came for a mid winter trip but will be back again for a summer vacation.  Ample space to accommodate your group and a wonderful outdoor fireplace, wet bar, and picnic tables. Can't wait for nicer weather to be able to go down to the river and take advantage of the rocky beach.  Plenty of room for our dogs - the dog run was nice to have.  We had a fabulous time and would recommend this property in a heartbeat.

We had a weeklong stay with rotating guests and everyone loved it! It's such a beautiful setting, there's so much to do and it accommodated a lot of people comfortably.

This is a fun awesome location.  We had a great time. It's not the easiest  place to find, but well worth it.

Great place to stay with good access to fishing spots. Lots ameneties including arcade games, hot tubs, three TVs, with a beautiful deck overlooking the river. House was well stocked with cooking equipment.

We loved the outdoor fireplace and kitchen.  We were able to host a large gathering of relatives on the back deck and had plenty of space for cooking.  Everyone had a blast playing the arcade games.

Had a great weekend and enjoyed the place.  Something to note - there are only beds for 6.

This unique and cozy Government Camp vacation rental will be a perfect place to stay while enjoying the snowy winters and nature-filled summers of the Mt. Hood area. The large yard is great for picnics and basketball in the summer and snowball fights, sledding,and building snowmen in the winter. With just enough space for 10 guests to sleep and recharge for another day filled with adventure, this home is waiting for you!"

Located right in the middle of Government Camp (and just a few hundred feet from the Summit Ski Area), this home is in an unbelievably perfect spot for lovers of snow sports. Timberline Lodge and its surrounding slopes are a 10-minute drive up the mountain, and Mt. Hood Meadows is just 15 minutes away by car.

This two-bedroom, two-bathroom home has a unique shape - long and thin, with a small but efficient floorplan. The lower level contains a nice, comfortable living room with space for guests to sit around the fun electric fireplace and talk. A full bathroom and a bedroom with a double-size bed are also nestled on the ground floor.

A full kitchen may seem too small at first glance, but when you look closer you will see that it is fully equipped with everything you may need to cook up delicious meals for you and your guests. A mini-fridge even provides a separate place to store extra soda or beer without taking up valuable space in the standard-size fridge.

Upstairs you will find a second living room with lots of seating, a flat screen TV equipped with cable and a DVD player, DVD selection, board games, and a stereo. This home also has WiFi and books to borrow, so you will have no trouble finding ways to keep entertained!

The upper floor also has its own full bathroom with a washer and dryer, which means you won't have to worry about getting your clothes wet or dirty while exploring the area. A second bedroom has a queen-size bed and a lovely balcony to admire the view.

The house sleeps 4 to 6 adults comfortably, but 10 guests may sleep in this home, spread out among the two bedrooms and five futons that fold out into sleeping spaces. The house is perfect for two families with sleeping spaces and bathrooms on each floor. It is also great for a romantic getaway or to head up with a house full of friends to enjoy all that mount hood as to offer. With all the activities beckoning you away from this home, you may not want to spend too much time inside! "

Government Camp is a great place to stay if you love the outdoors. Perched on the side of majestic Mt. Hood, this town has restaurants (including the fabulous Mt. Hood Brewing Company) and a general store, but most people visit to experience the world-class snow sports on Mt. Hood itself. During the colder months, this is a perfect place for skiing, snowboarding, and snowman-building.

In the summer, even though most of the snow has melted on the mountain, there are still many activities to keep busy. Miles of hiking and biking trails crisscross the forested wilderness, offering some of the best views of the region. Nearby lakes such as Timothy Lake (20 miles south) or Clear Lake (10 miles south) offer wonderful summertime swimming, boating, fishing, and picnicking opportunities.

If you crave the amenities of a larger town, take a drive on the beautiful, tree-lined highway west for 30 miles to reach Sandy, which has a huge variety of restaurants, stores, businesses, and an especially amazing donut shop.

While you're out experiencing everything this enchanting, adventure-filled area has to offer, stay at this comfortable and homey Mt. Hood vacation rental with everything you need to enjoy your getaway!

Bear Creek Lodge is a very comfortable home for a close family group.  We were a group of 5, 3 adults and 2 children, and found the spaces cozy and each to use.  The kitchen is small but well equipped and everything was in good order.  We made especially good use of the porch - the children often played there and we ate a number of meals out there.  I would say that opened up the house and made it feel more spacious.  I really appreciated the quality of the housekeeping, very clean and fresh feeling.  There were also many other very nice touches that we all appreciated - comfortable places to sit, cozy throw blankets and pillows, lots of toys in good order for the children.

Pull the car into the garage of this lovely, two bedroom vacation rental just blocks from Government Camp. It's safe and secure. Now step into the living area and let the elegant lodge decor envelope you. From the copper-colored drapes to the dried flowers in the earthen vases and the rustic fireplace (gas) with stone facade, this is a perfect space for kicking back and enjoying your much deserved time away. In the shadow of Mount Hood, you'll not only be close to all the great skiing, hiking, kayaking and rafting available in and around Mount Hood National Forest, you'll also have access to the year 'round pools, sauna, hot tubs, and organized activities offered by the 28-acre, Collins Lake complex.

This charming vacation rental chalet is an end unit, so you'll have a little extra privacy. Though it's conveniently close to the pool, the laughter and voices from hot tub won't disturb you. This is a great space with lots of amenities; a perfect spot to just sit and read a book or work on the laptop (Free WIFI). Slip one of the DVDs you brought along into the player and watch a movie. Catch the latest episode of your favorite series on the cable TV. Or, head over to the Creekside clubhouse. There, you can burn off some calories in the heated pool (heated decks surround it to melt the snow in the winter), lounge in the hot tub or sauna, or read that book in front of the grand, floor to ceiling fireplace as the wood fire crackles and pops!

Your cook will love this kitchen! Not only will the stainless steel appliances (including a dishwasher), ample counter space, and numerous cabinets make cooking easy from prep to clean up, it's just plain gorgeous! The dark granite counters contrast beautifully with the light wood floors and cabinetry. And it's not all looks! This kitchen is fully stocked and ready to work. You'll also find a gas grill and patio furniture out on the deck to cook up some barbeque. If you're dining out, there are five restaurants in nearby Government Camp to choose from.

This lovely vacation rental condo will sleep six comfortably. There are two bedrooms, each with a queen bed. Both are spacious and bright with sunlight through big windows, and one of them also has a bunk bed for two more people. One of the bedrooms has a TV set for late-night viewing. Each bedroom has its own nicely appointed, full bath and there's a half-bath on the main level.

The little community of Government Camp is not only a doorway to myriad outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, kayaking, biking and climbing, it's also a historic treasure. You can hike or snowshoe up Blossom Trail (one of the original roads) to Timblerline Lodge, the Depression Era building constructed by an army of WPA workers in the '30s. There's skiing up there too, just as there is in nearby Skiibowl and Timberline Ski Area. Mount Hood Meadows is a little farther, about 17 minutes away on the eastern side of Mount Hood.

Collins Lake is kid-friendly, offering attractions like kiddy karts, kiddy canoe, mini golf, and interpretive trail hikes. Birders: nearby Rhododendron is renowned for its feathered inhabitants and has 25 places to take your binoculars and...well, watch! Plenty of golfing over in Welches - the site of the first golf course in Oregon. They're waiting for you to come and tee up. And don't leave without that souvenir: The shops and boutiques in Government Camp are waiting for you too!

So reserve this vacation rental chalet in rugged and beautiful Government Camp and enjoy all the wonders, recreational activities, and rich history of the Mount Hood area.

I think, The Collins Lake is the best place to stay in Government Camp!

We stayed at the condo for two nights. Our 9 and 4 year old loved having a pool we could walk to, we liked the bigger hot tub by the fire pit. The condo was clean. It had every thing we needed in the kitchen to cook our meals.

We really enjoyed our stay at Collins Lake.  The condo was nice as advertised and had lots of room for a family of four.  The heated pool and hot tubs were amazing.  Kids had a ball.

The location is perfect, just 2 min walking to restaurants. There are plenty of amenities in the complex and the townhouse makes you feel like home.

The accommodations are awesome and comfortable. Within walking distance to shops and restaurants.  Cozy gas fireplace. Heated garage parking. This location is just 20" away from awesome skiing and snowboarding  @ Mt. Hood Meadows. It is also right next to Ski Bowl, but we didn't go there this time since we had a good deal on our ski package with Vacasa rentals. Ask about the $99 3 day lift deal and the $99 3 day learn to ski package which included lift ticket, equipment rental, and three 2 hour lessons. Ski bowl has inner tube runs with a rope tow which we have used in the past. Make sure to bring snow chains. Once off the highway I had to chain up to go the last 1/4 mile.

Collin's Lake accommodations are fantastic!!! Condo is very clean, warm, cozy and roomy. The location is great if you want to go snowboarding or skiing at one of the ski resorts close by. Can't believe how beautiful the condo is and the surrounding area.  Don't have to wait in line to check out or check in with the emailed instructions and key lock box  procedure. Very convenient.  Thanks Vacasa!

Best place to stay on Mount Hood! Not one thing bad to say. It was an amazing experience! I will be back along with my friends and possibly more! Thank you for an outstanding vacation!

This condo is a great getaway and has a nice location in Government Camp. The kitchen is very nice and the beds are comfy! Being on the end unit gives the place lots of light from all the windows. It is great to have access to the nearby pool and sauna.

We will be returning in the summer to enjoy all the summertime adventures with our children. We are already planning our next trip.

We came to play in the snow in the winter! Used the pool, sauna and hot tube several times even though the temp was -3 to 22'. The Condo was perfect for 4-6 people. We never heard neighbors. Bring your own DVD's and games if you have kids coming. They have plenty of extra blankets and bedding. Garage is long, but narrow and fit the SUV with out the carrier on top. Extra parking is right next to the entrance since this is a corner unit.

Great place to stay and conveniently located. Government camp had some convenient stores and shops and gas also.

Mt Hood Brewery at Government camp was excellent! We also took the kids on the Mt. Hood Railroad Polar Express train out of Hood River which was super fun and went Tubing at the SkiBowl!

Very comfortable lodgings at Collins Lake.  We love the large soaking pool set in the woods.  The town of Government Camp is charming and the Adventure is just a short walk away.

Overall the condo was clean and quiet, some maintenance issues were relayed to management.  Kitchen is stocked, close to the pool and hot tub, walking distance to main government camp eateries.  We'd consider staying again.

A nice place to stay, it just needs better window treatments in the bed rooms to stop the street lights from coming in.

Had a wonderful time here! Chalet was very clean, and the kitchen was well-stocked. This was a perfect place to stay for a weekend skiing getaway!

This is one of the properties that had the most affordable rates during the holiday season and it was pretty nice overall.  The location cannot be beat!

We found our place to be warm and cozy and very comfortable. The pool and spa were easily accessible and the sauna was an added treat! We were so impressed with how quickly the snowplows cleared the property so guests could get out and about after a huge snowfall. We would definitely like to stay here again. The only slight downfall was that the Wifi was very spotty. However that just gave us the opportunity to read and play games!

I chose this rental for my daughter's 17th birthday celebration this past weekend.  The condo was perfect as I (as the lone parent/adult) was able to retreat to my well appointed bedroom to watch TV and read while my daughter and her 4 friends used the rest of the house.  I was always within earshot, but the size of the condo allowed the girls to really feel like it was their place for the weekend.  We all went sledding and had lunch at the Ratskeller, but otherwise I made use of the well appointed kitchen to prepare meals.  The girls (and I) had an absolutely fabulous time.  It was a birthday my daughter will always remember.  Thanks for your hospitality!!

Wonderful place to stay. Very clean, beautifully decorated. The place looks just like the pictures posted. Next time we will bring our swim suits, the pool and hot tub looked great.

Condo was well appointed. The pools were great. Really liked the garage and the security. Would stay there again.

The property was clean and well stocked with dishes, utensils, etc.  The beds are very comfortable. The pool is steps away, yet situated so we did not hear late-nite visitors to the hot tub.  We enjoyed our stay very much.

Nestled in the trees right by the Sandy River, this Mt. Hood vacation rental offers peace and quiet near the Rhododendron. Spend a star-filled evening soaking in your private hot tub and listening to the sounds of Clear Creek running through the backyard. Perfect for a ski retreat, family vacation, or couples traveling together, this vacation home in the woods offers rustic, lodge decor but with modern amenities.

The cozy living area is equally suited for long conversations, relaxing in front of the stone-faced fireplace, or TV viewing. With cable and a DVD player, you'll have a lot of entertainment choices here, as well as WiFi. So throw another log on the fire and settle back on one of the leather sofas for a quiet night in.

When you want to fix a meal, the bright, spacious kitchen has all the appliances you'll need, including a dishwasher. There's even a coffee grinder for fresh beans in the morning. You can retreat to the sun room with your mug for a great view of the forest, or if it's nice outside, go out on the deck and the birds will provide a perfect soundtrack for the wonderful view.

The private deck also boasts a hot tub for leisurely soaks and a gas grill for outdoor summer barbecues. There's a picnic table right on the deck for al fresco dining, as well as a second deck right down by the river. Or head out to the outdoor fire pit after dinner for some late night s'mores.

The master bedroom is a rustic, lodge-like sanctuary with a pine log queen sized bed, plaid wallpaper, TV, and sliding glass doors leading out to the deck. A second bedroom has a lovely full sized four poster bed, wainscoting, and elegant decorative touches. And for the kids, a third bedroom with two sets of twin bunk beds means they can have a slumber party every night. This home will sleep up to six guests and has two full bathrooms.

When you want a quiet spot to relax, play games, or read a book, the lower level den is just the spot. You'll have patio access and a bar to enjoy a glass or two of wine, while playing a game of cards. There's also a stereo with a CD player for listening to music.

This Mt. Hood vacation rental is only a short drive from the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway and restaurants like The Rendezvous and the ZigZag Inn. So, even though you do have your own kitchen, dining out is definitely an option during your stay! Also right nearby is golf at The Resort at the Mountain, hiking and biking trails, and rock climbing. In the immediate area, you can even make an appointment for a spa treatment like a river rock massage. Plan an outdoor adventure or get pampered - it's up to you.

Ski season is a popular time to visit, with Timberline Lodge, Mt. Hood Meadows, and Mt. Hood Skibowl all within a 24 mile drive. While the snow is on the ground, you can explore Rhododendron on snowshoes, cross-country skis, or by snowmobile. However you sightsee through the surrounding National Forest, you'll love coming back for a soak in the hot tub. And don't worry about keeping your clothes clean and dry out on your adventure - there's a washer and dryer back at your Barlow Creekside Lodge.

A peaceful escape to the mountains is within reach when you stay at this gorgeous Mt. Hood cabin rental. Enjoy river views, a comfortable rustic design, and great amenities whether you stay for a fun-filled weekend or more.

The home was cozy and comfortable once heat got fixed and house aired out. Hottub and river lovely. Vacasa very helpful and repairman super nice. Decor cute.

House was clean, basement was a great space for teenagers (or younger kids).  It was more private than we expected which was nice.   Very well stocked with amenities.  We had no cell service at the house, but they had wireless internet which we had no problems with.  Grocery store was a short easy drive away.  Liked the proximity to a ranger station which provided us with info on awesome trails/waterfalls we never would have known about - there are trails to falls about 5 miles down Lolo Pass that we loved (sorry don't remember the name).

The stream near the house is great. Very suitable for hikers who like moderate to difficult hikes of all ages. House was cozy, Basement was cool always. House is surrounded by trees so was great in the summer.

House was as pictured and described. It was in a beautiful setting along the river. Lots of things in the area to see and do. Several nice restaurants in the area and shoppping.

We were pleased with the location and facilities of the place.  It is convenient to the main road but we were not bothered by road noise.  The stream in the back is lovely and we enjoyed eating outside.  Also loved the hot tub.  The house is clean and well equipped. We were able to buy groceries and cook our meals in the kitchen.  The Mt. Hood area is wonderful for hiking.  Great experience for the five of us.

Our only complaint was that it was a little warm and stuffy in the living room after a hot day.  There was also a musty smell in the sunroom off the master bedroom and in the lower level.  Otherwise, great place.

Great place to take the family.  Relaxing, peaceful surroundings, lots of games and movies for the kids.  Cute bunk beds and nice and cool downstairs!  Very impressive master bedroom with big poster bed with ceiling fan.  Went here with 3 girlfriends and had a blast relaxing in the hot tub and eating at the picnic bench down by the river.  I would vacation in this home again and would recommend it for singles or family.

The place is awesome, really good for those who wants to get out of the city and relax have a good time with family and/or friends. Th e sound of the river its awesome make you feel like you are inside the forest. The house is  pretty nice furnished , all in good style. The hot tube outside works pretty good. I totally recommend this place, Im planning on coming back already.

We had a great time with 5 boys in the house, ages 8-16, including a French exchange student.  They enjoyed the bunk beds and the games that were included with the house, as well as the hot tub.  It was a nice space that offered good gathering areas as well as separation of space since the kids had their own floor.  The creek rushing by and the large, old trees made us feel like we were so close to Oregon's natural wonders.  A fun time was had by all in the charming home.

We were lucky to stay in this cozy house on a weekend that saw almost a foot of snow. It was great to have a wood-burning stove and nice cozy beds to sleep in after a long day of skiing. While a bit finicky in terms of temperature, we had tons of fun in the hot tub as well!

Charming home  in wooded area next to river. Comfortable beds, close to grocery shopping, skiing, and hiking trails. Stocked with lots  of towels, soaps,  pillows and blankets. A few things needed fixing but overall a lovely place to stay !

We enjoyed our stay in the Barlow-Trail home. Everything inside and out exuded charm. The house is surrounded by a lovely wrap around deck overlooking Clear Creek. Inside the beds are comfortable, there's a supply of board games as well as maps of the area if you feel like exploring. The house was a perfect fit for our annual "cousins camp" adventure. The ammenities; dishwasher, washer, dryer, wifi, etc. were an added bonus. The staff at Vacasa was informative and helpful. Overall we had a wonderful experience.

Very beautiful setting, away from the highway and with plenty of privacy. Charming house and decor.  We were especially impressed with the amenities: lots of towels, hygiene products, kitchen supplies.  And the hot tub was heated and ready to go when we arrived!  All of our party (kids and adults) had a great time.

Great Spot...Snow Boarding and the wood stove made this a perfect adventure:-)

Thanks !!!!

What a wonderful, spacious facility for my husband, me, our two sons and their families.  It was a pleasant Thanksgiving in a very comfortable, relaxed environment.  We had challenges getting the television to work, but we did not miss it.  The toys and games available for our grandchildren were great.

We were very happy with the property, overall. The size was perfect for our party. Kichen facility was good enough to stay for severl nights. we definitely would like to come back. Just for your information, I would like to point out several things we noticed:

- Drainer in the main bathroom needs to be cleaned

- Hottub cleaner was not supplied

- The lamp on the deck next to the tub was not working

- It was very hard to open the main (upstairs) bathroom door

- It was not very confy to have a carpet in the downstairs bathroom

Thank you very much for supporting our vacation.

Ideal property for two adult couples and up to 6 children.  Rustic yet charming; well stocked with everything you need but your own meal basics (even has an abundant supply of spices and extras).  Lot of games and activities for the whole family.  Very comfortable.  Had a wonderful experience.  The little kids LOVED the bears (stuffed teddy bears in the house)!

Combining a fun retro design with an ideal location, this three-bedroom Government Camp vacation rental has room for a crowd! Book a stay for a group retreat, a family getaway, or a ski trip with close friends.

After you make your way up the tall, outdoor steps, you'll find that this getaway has everything you'll need for a memorable stay - WiFi, comfortable furniture, a wood burning stove, and lots of vintage personality! Plus, you'll be able to walk to a lot of Government Camp's restaurants and attractions.

The lower level of this Government Camp vacation home boasts a cozy seating area with pastel color palette, vintage lamps, and a large wall-mounted flat screen TV. There's also a  DVD player, so be sure to bring your favorite movies from home!

Sliding glass doors lead out to the deck - a perfect spot to take in the view on warmer days. In the summer, you can enjoy the sun in the afternoon with a glass of wine and a good book. The outdoor stairs wrap around the building creating a secret space that will appeal to both kids and adults.  And when it's all snowy outside, you'll have great view from the living room, while you stay warm in front of a toasty fire.

There are a couple of tables set up in front of the windows for meals or working on your travel journal. And if you want to stay in for the night, around the corner you'll find a compact kitchen with a refrigerator, stovetop/oven, coffeemaker, blender, and microwave. It's ideal for making coffee in the mornings, popping some popcorn to go with a flick, or heating up leftovers from a dinner out. If the mood strikes, you can even prepare a home-cooked meal, you'll just have to assign kitchen helpers to do their chopping and grating out at one of the window-front tables.

Two bedrooms are on this main level, one with a set of bunk beds, the other with a queen bed. Upstairs, there's a master bedroom with a king and two twin daybeds in the loft. Room for everyone! This charming Mt. Hood vacation rental will sleep up to eight guests with a maximum occupancy of 10. This duplex has a shared laundry room, so you can pack light if you'd like.

In winter, it's hard to find a better location than the Flying Stag Upper Chalet - Summit Ski Area is a couple of blocks away, Mt. Hood Skibowl is just on the west end of town, Timberline Lodge and Mt. Hood Meadows are a quick car drive away.

The Mt. Hood National Forest has numerous opportunities for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing - from your Government Camp getaway you can ski right to the groomed trails at Trillium Lake, or make the drive north of Mt. Hood Meadows to Teacup Lake. Here you'll encounter 12km of groomed trails, as well as a warming hut. After working up an appetite on the trails, there are a number of restaurants right in Government Camp, steps away from your chalet.

Summer brings just as much activity to this region. Take a scenic chairlift ride up the mountain at Timberline Lodge and make the hike down through green grass and wildflowers. The Wildwood Recreation Area just outside of Welches has over five miles of hiking trails that parallel the Salmon River. And right in Government Camp there are many paved biking trails for a breathtaking tour of this beautiful natural area. And don't forget - a scenic drive along the Mt. Hood Scenic Byway is always an option!

No matter if it's during ski season or the sunny summer months, stay right in the middle of all the action in Government Camp at this fun and funky Mt. Hood chalet.

We have rented on several occasions through vacasa rentals, never had any issues, the whole process also goes very smoothly.

We had a great stay here with another family. Plenty big for 4 adults and 4 kids. The kids loved the bunk room and the loft. Great location for enjoying Government Camp and nearby skiing. Small kitchen but we mostly ate out, so it wasn't that a big of a deal.

Everyone had something to do.  Grandma stayed by the fire while the rest of us went either skiing, snow shoeing, inner tubing, out to lunch all that was walking or bus distance.  This was amazing.  WE all met back for a great time of relaxing and enjoying each other's company. Thanks for sharing your wonderful space.  The snow was great too and we enjoyed making an igloo.  We will be back next year.

We love the location! Within walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in govy. Ski bowl adventure park was the highlight of our stay! The chalet is cute with a unique retro style that we loved! Vacasa staff is top notch!!

I love the vintage lamps and the beautiful, handmade furniture in this cabin. It has a great feel and everything was thoughtfully decorated and clean. Beds were comfortable, even the futons. The kitchen is well-stocked, albeit rather small. Our only complaint was that the hot water ran out after a few uses. There were ten adults in our group and many of us were running the Timberline race, so it would have been nice for us to all have hot showers post run.

Great house for a big group. Beds are awesome. Place was clean and had good amount of cooking utensils. Fireplace wAs great. Loved the balcony.

THE GOOD

-great location

-good price

-clean linens

-lots of trash cans all over the place

-lots of wood for the stove

THE BAD

-odd lighting and furniture layout

-scratchy towels

-fire hazards (electrical cords touching baseboard heat)

-un-kept; trashy as soon as you step out the door

We had four little kids with us so we spent a lot of time in the unit; this is better suited for couples without kids or bunch of guys who spend more time on the slopes/trails.

The location of this rental property is simply awesome!  You are in the heart of Govy with easy walking access the key locations such as the Huckleberry Inn and the Ratskeller.  Of course hiking, skiing and even summertime SkiBowl activities are at your doorstep.  The funky retro interior opens out to a deck with a commanding view.  It has a laid back vibe while having everything you need for your stay.  There are plenty of comfortable beds available to crash out on after your fun on the mountain as well.  All in all everyone thoroughly enjoyed their stay here!

Thank you for a lovely stay! We especially enjoyed the deck for warm sunny days and the bar-like seating at the front windows. The daybeds in the loft would be great for reading and napping, a sleepover spot for the kids or extra space for more friends! Fun decor.

Built in 2009, this spacious Mt. Hood vacation home has plenty of room for family and friends, in an immaculate, well-designed space. Much of the beautiful natural pine wood in the home, from the ceiling beams to the window trim, was created from pine trees that originally stood right on the property. And with a great location in Welches, a hot tub, and beautiful outdoor entertaining area, this wonderful Mt. Hood retreat offers year-round adventure for your next group getaway!

A large open living area has tall, slanted ceilings, recessed lighting, and a gas fireplace to create a cozy environment that encourages conversation or an evening watching movies on the wall-mounted flat screen TV (there's both a DVD player and BluRay). The sectional sofa is plush and inviting - the perfect spot for a lazy afternoon reading a book and sipping tea. There are also plenty of board games to pick from for an after-dinner game, and a collection of children's movies for keeping the kids entertained.

Right nearby, the kitchen has lots of room for multiple chefs and is well-stocked. There are granite countertops, shiny stainless steel appliances, and specialty gadgets like an espresso maker, a slow cooker, and a hot air popcorn machine. The dining table seats eight, with extra seating at the breakfast bar and outside. For the smallest guests, there is even a plastic chair-top high chair.

Next to the dining room table, sliding glass doors leads to a lovely private backyard that borders a forested nature area. Guests can relax in the brand new seven person hot tub, sit around the fire pit roasting marshmallows and making s'mores, or have a glass of wine and conversation under the stars. There's also a gas grill for family cookouts on nice, sunny afternoons.

In all five bedrooms, comfortable mattresses await your slumber. The master bedroom has a beautiful wood beam King bed, fireplace, and access to the lovely back yard. Bring your espresso back to bed in the morning, or slide open the doors and sip your morning coffee outside. The attached master bathroom has double sinks, a large vanity, separate shower, and a jetted soaking tub.

Two other bedrooms also have queen sized beds and large walk-in closets. One has its own TV with VCR and a video tape movie library. Two other bedrooms are designed to accommodate children or teenagers, with two twin-over-twin bunk beds and one full-over-full bunk bed. There are also two futons, one in the open loft open to the living room, one in the Master Bedroom on the main floor. Also one extra twin-sized mattress, in one of the Queen upstairs Bedroom. Plus a Pack'n Play crib if needed. This home will a sleep a total 15 lucky guests, but please check to see if the bed configuration will fit your group's needs.

This palatial, modern mountain getaway is located in a quiet neighborhood, just perfect for an extended family vacation, friend getaway, or couples traveling together. There are several children's bicycles in the garage for the kids to tool around the neighborhood and explore. If anyone gets dirty while out having fun, no worries - a large laundry room with a full sized washer and dryer will keep everyone in clean socks throughout your stay!

Just a half mile away, there's a grocery store for picking up supplies, and a ski shop in the shopping center right along Hwy 26. In nice weather, the Resort at the Mountain's 27-hole golf course is open to the public and only a short two minute  drive away.

Looking for a ski getaway home base? Driving times to the three ski areas are minor - Mount Hood Ski Bowl, with its 34 fully lit runs, 65 runs total, and night skiing opportunities is only a 16 minute drive from the house. Iconic Timberline Lodge is only 27 minutes away and Mount Hood Meadows is a 30-40 minute drive.

In the summer, hiking and mountain biking trails abound, and views for landscape photography are plentiful. Mt. Hood Ski Bowl also has a summer Adventure Park for the whole family featuring bungee jumping, indy karts, mountain biking, horseback riding, a rock wall, and more! Spring, summer, fall, or winter, this Mt. Hood getaway will house your group in comfort while you discover the beautiful and scenic Mt. Hood area.

This house was perfect for a group of five golfers that needed their own rooms and openness to enjoy a great weekend. I'll be renting this home again bringing my family and friends.

The house made the weekend.

Thank you

We had all our kids and grandkids and the home is beautiful and highly conducive to family times together - - shared meals, games, outdooor activities, hot tubbing, etc.  Well maintained and clean home.  Wonderful getaway spot.

The Welches property was perfect for a large group and a full Thanksgiving dinner. We had 8 adults and 4 kids so it was a full house.  The kitchen was well equipped to put on a full Thanksgiving dinner which we thoroughly enjoyed. The hot tub was perfect on a snowy evening and morning. Overall, an excellent stay in an excellent and beautiful home. We hope to come back next year.

We stayed in this house for three nights July 17 - 20 with our two children and 8 grandchildren, along with their spouses. 15 total. We had plenty of room to spread out, plenty of sleeping choices. The house was very clean, bright and open. We loved the knotty pine woodwork throughout, along with the outdoor themed decor such as the wall lamps made from snow shoes, and antler light fixtures. The kitchen was roomy and open allowing for conversation while cooking. If you are cooking for a large crowd, you should bring large cooking pans. We only found two small fry pans and one small stock pot large enough to cook spaghetti sauce in.

I also feel like people need to know this is in a close neighborhood subdivision of Welches, and not a secluded house in the mountains, although once inside the house, we felt more secluded as the back yard is open to a beautiful wooded area. A beautiful home, and a wonderful weekend spent with our family.

We enjoyed our stay at a lovely, quiet home. We stayed in the Summer and loved the golfcourse, hiking and the size of the house. It's very open and it's setting with woods behind was lovely. We look forward to staying sometime in the winter to ski if we ever get any snow!!

Great place for both the adults and kids. Beautiful and spacious with plenty of room for everyone. We had a wonderful time with our kids and grandkids.!

Been there with my family it was amazing place huge place nice beds living area is awesome want to come again

it was very pleasing to stay at this vacation home the layout of the home is very neat everything with thought out and it was very comfortable. We will definitely stay here again.

We booked this home for 18 people  (8 adults and 10 kids) and there was plenty of space for all of us, although one of the adult couples had to occupy a futon in the loft area.  Aside from that, the kitchen and eating areas are easily large enough to accommodate this number of people.  We were very impressed with the look and feel of the home.  It has obviously been recently remodeled and it shows.  The only wrinkle we had was with the entertainment system.  It is a complicated system and a call to Vacasa didn't go much farther than, "Make sure it's plugged in."  Fortunately, we found the business card of the guy who installed the system and a call to him got us up and running in a few minutes.  Incidentally, the installer mentioned that the system is probably too complicated to be in a rental home... Aside from that, we have no complaints.

Riverfront and charming with an outdoor firepit

New to the rental market, this charming cottage at the beginning of the proposed "Wild and Scenic" Molalla River Corridor is the perfect retreat for those seeking a romantic getaway, fly fishing adventure or home base for exploring the area's nearby numerous attractions.

Molalla River Cottage  is cozy and bright, tastefully decorated and offers a pleasant respite for those seeking peaceful relaxation in a beautiful rural setting. Entering the front door you will find a fully equipped kitchen with everything needed to prepare your own meals if desired. As you walk through the kitchen you will find the open living room with gas burning fireplace and hardwood floors. There is a comfy daveno, chairs and day bed for lounging or sleeping. Cozy togetherness awaits whether you choose to relax with a good book or enjoy a movie or music on the DVD player.

This cottage features one large bedroom with queen bed on the opposite end of the house and full bathroom with shower only ( no tub). This getaway is a single level floor plan for those with limited mobility although there are a few steps to the front porch and a step down to the living room. The back porch provides a peaceful place to relax by the creek on a warm and sunny summer day or a BBQ in the evening. There are friendly dogs that belong to the owners and live near this home, so if there is a pet allergy in your group, keep that in mind.

Perhaps the most appealing feature of this lovely cottage is easy access via a short marked trail through meadow/pasture to the beautiful Molalla River. The trail leading to the river is slightly steep at the end. The river changes with the seasons and the cottage owners provide a lovely sitting area by the river with fire pit for quiet reflection. The river can have strong currents at different times of the year and caution is advised when swimming, fishing, rafting, etc. Renters are advised to check on local conditions and any necessary licenses for fishing, etc.

Sweet Creek Cottage provides a cozy and comfortable stay within easy access of the Molalla River Corridor, Hardy Creek trail system, (horses and mountain bikes, hiking), and the Table Rock Wilderness Area. A drive along this scenic waterway reveals numerous waterfalls and geological features. This charming cottage is a 1 hour  drive from Portland, 15 miles from the historic town of Silverton, where you will find the beautiful Oregon Garden and just 7 miles from the rural town of Molalla where full services are provided: groceries, restaurants, medical services, gas, etc.

Molalla is also home of the world famous "Molalla Buckeroo" and Parade during the 4th of July holiday season, professional bull riding events, world class sky diving, city parks, and historic sites. Easy access to numerous sites of interest, rural beauty, and the Molalla River make this retreat a great choice for an active getaway or a quiet and peaceful time of rest and relaxation.

Very cute out-of-the way cottage about 8 miles outside of Molalla. Easy drive to town and surrounding areas. We enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again.

For a last minute find, we were more then pleased. The cabin was cute, cleaned and fully stocked with more then we needed. The River was amazing!  The owners are a bit too close for comfort(I only say that cause it was our anniversary and we were looking for a bit more privacy) but they are very quiet and kind. Chloe was a special treat!  I think you will be very pleased...We cant wait to go back!

This is a beautiful property!  It was a little farther from the city than we expected (about an hour away from Portland and Salem)

If you're looking for a peaceful place to get away from it all it doesn't get much better

Sweet Creek Cottage is situated in a beautiful and peaceful setting...just what we were looking for a weekend away!

This is a great get out of touch location.  There is no cell phone service unless you drive out about a mile.  It worked for me, but be aware.  The owners were wonderful and offered great advice of where to go to enjoy the natural beauty of the Molalla River.  I would go back to this spot.  The bathroom is small, but it meets all major requirements.

A thumbs up on this place.

This cozy Brightwood cabin is a classic Mt. Hood vacation rental: a laid-back getaway with a fireplace, exposed timber, and an amazing location right on the Salmon River!

The cabin itself is located just off Highway 26 for easy access at any time of year, but the sound of the Salmon River rushing past easily drowns out any traffic noise. Golf and groceries are found just five minutes up the road in Welches.

This getaway has all the essentials you'll need to enjoy a weekend on the mountain. Curl up by the fireplace on an overstuffed armchair with your morning coffee. There is a cable TV with DVD player for laid-back afternoons, plus a shelf stocked full of board games for more interactive entertainment. If you're working while away, you'll appreciate the wireless Internet access; if not, you can always browse reviews for the nearby restaurants and pubs while you relax by the fire.

Take advantage of the open kitchen with a 1950's flair to cook some homemade meals. Those bright blue cabinets hold some fun extras like a blender for smoothies and a coffee grinder for the perfect grind on your favorite brew. Dine inside or out - it's up to you!

Open up the curtains at the rear of the house and take in unbelievable views of the Salmon River rushing past, no matter what the weather may be outside. When the sun shines, step out to the patio overlooking the river. There is a charcoal grill for summer barbecues and a table and chairs so you can dine outdoors when the weather warms. The cabin is also dog-friendly, with an additional nightly pet fee.

This is a cozy one-bedroom, one-and-a-half bathroom home with an additional loft. Upstairs, the open sleeping loft has a queen bed and two twins. The downstairs sofa unfolds into a comfortable full-size sleeper, allowing up to six guests to share the space. There is one full bath downstairs, with an upstairs half bath to make sharing the space easier.

Come and enjoy the wonders of Mt. Hood! There are hiking trails and fishing holes galore, and of course the world-class skiing at four different resorts. Skibowl is the closest to this cabin, less than 15 miles away; is just a few miles further.

For a laid-back riverside retreat, you won't find much better than this cozy Oregon vacation cabin near Brightwood on Mt. Hood!

When choosing a vacation rental, being near and hearing the river was a plus - this house had it.  Having cable TV, wifi and washer/dryer, also were very important to us - this house had that, too !  the sleeping arrangements were a little different then we are used to, it would be nice to have individual sleeping areas for those of us that sleep lightly or snore.  Otherwise, great location to see everything in the area.

This cabin is very cozy and right above the Salmon River.  Access is a little tricky, but well worth it.  The sound of the river at night is so perfect....  very nice vacation spot.

Great Great position along the Salmon River.  You hear the river as soon as you get out of the car! The photos don't do justice to the view from inside the house and on the back patio- you have a wonderful window to the Salmon River at this house.  Within minutes of Wildwood Recreation Site which has many wonderful trails (that allow dogs on leash!).

When our cabin fell through in Utah literally while in route, vacasa came through.    We quickly found three options in a great price range.   We chose this little place for the river view and convenience to hiking trails and made a quick left and headed towards Oregon.   The cabin was fine and never distracted from us having a fantastic vacation.   However we spent most of our time on the trails and not in the cabin.   The cabin is pet friendly which was great.  The washer and drier worked great too.   The cabin is more conveniently located rather than remote and sandwiched between two other properties.  If you are looking for a secluded place to spend a lot of cabin time in, this may not be the place for you, but if a great river view is what you want after an active day with family and dogs, then you will be very happy.  It was clean and close to stores.   However, you need to bring all food staples     There wasn't even salt and pepper.   We would stay again.

Awesome getaway, the cabin was so romantic and cozy. It really grew on us. Excited to come stay again, miss it already.

I stayed here for two nights for a quiet retreat with my sister.  The cabin is homey and comfy and very relaxing.  The best feature is the view of the Salmon River from the back of the cabin. It is just spectacular and the sound of the rushing water is very soothing.  Fixing a meal in the kitchen with the river as a backdrop is wonderful.

The kitchen was stocked well to prepare typical cabin meals and we appreciated both the coffee grinder and the microwave.  One nice feature of the cabin is electric outlets everywhere!  Easy to plug in your phone, tablet or computer.

Though fairly close to the main highway, there is little road noise and overall the cabin is very quiet.

The beds at the cabin are in need of a refresh, but the rest of the accommodations are good,  The cabin was clean, comfortable, spacious enough for 2 or 3 and cool and shady on a warm day.  Check out procedures are reasonable - wash and put away dishes and take out the trash.  We also opted to strip the beds and run the linens because we had time.  The cabin was well stocked with towels, dishsoap, sponges, cleanup supplies, toilet paper etc.

We chose the property for convince more than anything but once we were there the quirky kitsch bathroom and warm cabin feel topped off with the abundance of wood, wood burning stove and wild river made for an amazing stay.    20+ miles to Meadows , take out coffee from zig zag with a beautiful morning drive was perfect.  Thanks for a wonderful stay

This is a great cabin. Plenty of wood for a fire with a nice river outside that drowns out the cars passing on the highway. It is next to another house but nestled in the great town of Brightwood. The cabin was clean with plenty of room to move around. Will be back! Thanks

I went to this cabin for some much needed time to clear my head following my mother passing away. My mom always loved the mountain. This cabin was just what I needed. Very peaceful and very relaxing. The sound of the river right out the windows was great. I wish there was better river access but it was still amazing. I can't wait to go back. Also the staff was great. This was a very last minute reservation and the staff was great to help me. I highly recommend them and Retreat on the Salmon

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

Sure, you love to golf, and what better place to be than right here in this beautiful Welches vacation rental townhome on the fairway of world-class, Resort at the Mountain. But golfing isn't everything, is it? (Okay, maybe it is.)

But Welches is much more than the three golf courses right in the area. There's a great spa and restaurant right there in the resort, and surrounding Welches are the natural wonders of the Mount Hood area - rivers, mountains, forests - that call to you with hiking, fishing, rafting, and every manner of winter sport.

There's lots of room to stretch out in this big living room with vaulted ceilings. If you're just back from the slopes, throw a log on the wood fireplace and warm up your toes while you're waiting for dinner. You'll have plenty of entertainment options. Bring along some of your favorite DVDs and CDs to pop into the player. And make sure the iPod's loaded up - there's a doc for that too. For some serious relaxation, slide into the warm, swirling waters of the jetted tub in the master bathroom.

Golfers Villa has a big, well-stocked kitchen that's up to any chef's challenge. Lots of cupboards and counter space make preparing any meals easy. Serve it up at the dining table with room for four and a great view of - you guessed it - the golf course. (Diners can also cozy up to the bar on three stools.) If you've got a taste for barbeque, just fire up the gas grill on the deck. If you're heading out, there are some great eateries right in the resort where you can get everything from a steak to a "wee bite." Or, head into Welches where you'll find 12 different places to eat, serving just about every taste.

With three bedrooms and a loft, this townhome vacation rental sleeps up to 6. The master bedroom, on the main floor, has a queen bed and a bathroom with the jetted tub. There are queen beds in two of the other bedrooms upstairs, one of which has a bunk twin as well.

After you've played the final hole and you've settled into the comfy living room of this luxurious vacation rental, do yourself a favor: pull out the laptop and look up the beautiful Indian legend surrounding this area. Welches is right next to Mount Hood National Forest.

For skiers, Golfers Villa is 20 minutes from Skibowl and 30 minutes from Mt. Hood Meadows and Timberline Lodge. Just a few miles away is the popular Salmon Creek Trail. Hike one-way (2.6 miles) or round trip (5.2 miles). It's just one of 31 trails of varying difficulty around Mount Hood. And, there's rafting, fishing, kayaking, horse back riding - everything you'd expect from 60 square miles of wilderness area. Of course, there are lots of place to golf too. So call now and reserve this beautiful townhome for your next Mount Hood getaway.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here; the kitchen was well-stocked with basic ingredients, and all the kitchen gadgetry necessary to make a lovely Thanksgiving feast.  The house dÃ©cor was inviting and the lay-out and furniture was comfortable.  Great place to spend a week.

One note to owners would be to check on the door-mounted mirror in the master bed/bath.  The screws and clips holding the mirror are failing;  the bottom clips are pulling away from the door, and the top clips are barely in contact with the mirror.  Definitely something you'll want to check on immediately.

We had a lovely stay, and look forward to visiting again!  Thanks!

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

Great location in the Resort area.  The rental was well maintained, very clean and well appointed with all the essentials including a well furnished kitchen.  Great for families or guys golf weekend.  The only slight negative was that there is that the backyard deck space is small,

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

We really enjoyed this property. Plenty of room, comfortable furniture, and tastefully decorated. This home is close to the pool, walking trails, and happy hours! Already looking forward to our next visit.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

We stayed for an entire month and the house was super comfortable and clean. The kitchen was fully stocked with anything you would need. I would highly recommend this house. Vacasa was really great and went the extra mile with customer service.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

This was a perfect house for our family--some went skiing at Mt Hood, some went to the Ski Bowl adventure park.  We appreciated the discounted lift tickets.  The beds were comfortable and the 2 1/2 baths were nice to have. The house was well equipped for cooking breakfast and dinner.  We did have difficulty finding automatic dish soap and never did find the  laundry soap to help with the clean-up.  This was the first time we used VACAS and we would highly recommend this--from  booking the house to the actual stay it was a very positive experience.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

The Kitchen was stocked well with cooking pans, utensils, dinnerware. I even found a meat thermometer for the turkey. The bathrooms had a huge stock of towels, soap, washclothes.  The bedrooms were comfy. We liked the extra blankets and pillows. The kitchen table was a little worn. Didn't bother us though.

This home is in excellent condition and is located close to all resort amenities.  Spacious main floor and large kitchen make this home comfortable for large families.  Large gas bbq on rear deck makes grilling a breeze.  The upstairs bedrooms are "cozy", but very comfortable.  Plenty of towels, and a large laundry room are a nice bonus.  So many resort activities...we never had a boring moment.  Already planning next summer's vacation in this home.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

The rental was well equiped and everything was as explained. No surprises and very easy. we took advantage of the pool at Resort at the mtn which was nice skied at timberline and toured the area. This is a very nice area did not get a chance to golf - ran out of time

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

We has a great time.  This is a lovely home close to the resort, activities and central to taking in all that the Mt. Hood area can offer.  The house is very clean and has ample room for family.  We will stay there again!

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

This is a great house for a large group to have adequate sleeping areas (sleeps 8 in beds with room for sleeping bags/cribs, too).  The living room/dining room/kitchen, however, are only large enough to accommodate 6-7 and that would be tight. It is very comfortable for 4-5 people.  From the living room, you look out to trees/forested area and one end of the golf course rather than other houses/condos which makes it feel more secluded/peaceful. This house is VERY well supplied with the necessities (pots/pans, dishes, utensils, etc). The home is very clean and the furniture (couches/beds) are all very comfortable and well maintained.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

Our family came up for a long weekend from Southern California to attended a wedding at the Timberline Lodge. None of us had ever been to the Portland/Mt. Hood area before. We did not know where to stay, what to do or what to expect from the area. We found the Golfers Villa through Vacasa and we found the home to be exactly what we wanted and needed in a place to stay. The home was very clean, very comfortable and well maintained. We found that for our event and travels around the Portland/Mt. Hood area, the home was perfectly located in a spot where we could all enjoy may different activities from sightseeing, hiking and of course attending the wedding. We would  love to come back to the area and we would definitely stay in this home again if is was available. Would love to try out the golf course.  Kudos to the homeowner and to Vacasa. Thanks for a great time.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

the directions to the place were bad and the cell reception was selective....the wifi was the same....and just our luck the pool was out of service 4 of the 5 days we were there...the house its self was awesome.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

Super clean home supplied with an abundance of items for your vacation. Very easy booking process. Nice location near Mt. Hood. They even offer very late check out for a nominal fee! The only minor con for us was that there weren't TV's in the master or kid's rooms. Will definitely return to this villa and will recommend to everyone! Thanks for a wonderful stay!

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

We really enjoyed our stay, the only thing you might change in the future is the directions.  on the directions emailed to me it said to turn onto E Fairway Estates Ave, but it should read E Fairway Ave (no estates).  Lori

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

We enjoyed staying at this property and found the layout very condusive for an extended family weekend.  Everything was in good condition.  The house was nicely decorated and comfortable.

The only issue we had was with the driving directions provided by Vacasa, we had one address listed for the property, but then another address listed in the driving directions.  Subsequently the driving directions where incorrect for where we needed to be.  We were able to figure it out on our own.

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

We really enjoyed the spaciousness and amenities of the house.  The location was perfect. We really enjoyed spending New Years Eve at the celebration at the restaurant at the lodge.  Overall a great time and we will definitely return!

We had a very comfortable stay in this pretty house in a beautiful, quite setting around a golf course. The house was very clean and provided everything to accommodate our group of 6 people. We will certainly go there again.

Fabulous experience with Vacasa and the residence.  Everything went smooth and the home was clean & welcoming.  Very well stocked kitchen.  We prepared a full Christmas dinner and had everything we needed.  We definately would use Vacasa again and request this residence.  Thank you so much!!!

The Coyote: Lean; adaptable. As its namesake suggests, let this comfortable, reasonably priced cabin be the base camp for your year 'round, alpine experience. Just 1 hour and 15 minutes from Portland, Coyote House is three miles from Parkdale and a short trip from all the outdoor adventures awaiting you in the Upper Hood River Valley and Mt. Hood area. Let it be the place you lay your head after a day of skiing, hiking, or fishing. Or, grab your G.P.S. and try the latest high-tech game of hide and seek called "geocaching." (Look it up!)

Pack in your eats and fix a nice meal in the full kitchen, or, in the summer, fire up the barbie' around the back and enjoy a burger against a verdant mountain vista. Need milk or bread? No problem. Just hop in the car and visit one of three local groceries where you can also rent a DVD to enjoy after dinner. Grab a cup of coffee at a nearby coffee house or a cool craft brew from the local brew-pub. (Coyote has a TV but, sorry, no cable.)

Whether you're a group of two or a half-dozen, Coyote House can accommodate you. With a full kitchen, large dining area and living room, there's plenty of space to kick back. At bedtime, you'll find one bedroom with a queen bed, an additional queen bed in the loft (the ultimate bunk bed for the kids: access is by a ladder), and a comfortable queen size convertible couch in the living room. Also, plenty of secure space to stow your gear and room for two vehicles next to the cabin.

Coyote is just three short miles from Parkdale, a town whose roots are entangled with the Mount Hood Railroad whose directors decided, in 1910, that little Parkdale should be literally the end of the line. Parkdale is the final stop on the popular "Fruit Loop"  -  a tour of the many orchards in and around Hood River Valley. Coyote is close to many biking and hiking trails in Mount Hood National Forest such as Frog Creek Trail. There are 23 fishing spots in the Hood River Ranger District. Or, head over to Hood River on the majestic Columbia River, just 20 minutes north, where you'll find some of the best windsurfing in the world and restaurants to serve any taste. Skiers can take advantage of Vacasa's Mount Hood Meadows special (above). Mount Hood Meadows is 28 minutes south of Parkdale.

Coyote is an eco-friendly vacation destination. Organic cotton linens and towels, recycled paper products, and recycling are provided. Add the fact that Coyote's non-toxic cleaning products are used to clean house, and it's clear that Coyote House's environmental footprint is gentle and Green!

(The pooch and kitty are welcome too. Ask about conditions.)

Perfect home to escape the city with small kids. The house was clean, well stocked, and our 2.5 year old sons had a great time watching the cows across the street!

This place is great for dogs especially. The pasture out back gave our puppy a lot of room to run.

The house was very cold and took 24 hours to warm up. Otherwise it was very clean and roomy. The Location was a little far from attractions but very quiet and nice. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was nice.

I rented the coyote house for a hunting trip I was on and it could not have been in a better location for the late season deer hunt.

Really sweet spot. Had a nice view of the cows next door and it was super quiet. Bed was comfy tv was nice. It reminded me a lot of vermont. I would definitely stay there again!

Mt. Hood National Forest, with all the hiking trails and day trips to lakes, is at your door step.  We stayed at the house with our 4 year old grandson and two dogs.  It was perfect!  a nice big field to play in !!  very safe.  Would return any time.

We enjoyed our stay in the coyote house in Parkdale.  I really enjoyed eating breakfast outside watching the cows in the pasture across the gravel road. Very peaceful.

The coyote house was surprisingly quiet and we slept well. The beds were comfortable and the new kitchen is fully equipped. There was no TV reception but the dvd player worked fine. The location, near Parkdale, is close to hiking trails, rivers, wineries etc. so there are lots of things to do nearby.

The cabin is adorable. Most of it is freshly updated and has a very cozy, Ikea decor. The kitchen is very nice and the view of Mt.Hood is amazing.

Great for children.  Very peaceful and quiet.  Not fancy but a good value.  Well equiped kitchen for those who like to self cater.  Not much to do in immediate area but property is close to many activities.  Heated via electric space heaters and no AC, so might be better in Fall and Spring.

Travel along the Mt. Hood Scenic Highway for a stay at this charming Brightwood vacation cabin right on the Sandy River. This designer-owned one bedroom getaway is a real jewel in the woods with bright colors, heated bathroom floor tiles, and a large deck overlooking the river.

Located about two miles from Welches, and over 42 miles from Portland, this charming cabin in the woods is tucked in the forests along the banks of the Sandy River.

Perfect for two seeking a romantic retreat, you'll find tall ceilings, lots of windows, and a classic style in the living room. A cozy love seat is positioned in front of the wood stove for warming up on chilly nights and there's also a flat screen TV with Google Chrome where you can stream Netflix, Hulu etc...

A large wooden deck has a grill for evenings preparing meals and dining al fresco, as well as offering scenic views of the Sandy River. Sit outside on the deck with your morning coffee or lay down a mat and do some yoga stretches in the evening. Or, you can roast marshmallows over the outdoor fire pit and make s'mores for an evening snack.

The compact kitchen may have a small footprint, but it's big on style, with granite counter tops and  everything you'll need for creating delicious vacation meals! Start the day with hearty bowls of oatmeal and finish the day with baked salmon and broccoli for a special candlelight dinner. And although there is no dishwasher, you'll be able to wash and dry together, talking about the day's adventures and making vacation memories.

When it's time for bed, you'll find a cuddly queen-sized bed with a memory foam mattress. And in the mornings, you can start your day with a little luxury, stepping on heated tile floors in the bathroom.

Once you are ready to get out and about, you'll love the location of this Mt. Hood cabin! It's in a quiet neighborhood, steps away from the Wildwood Recreation Site, a 680-acre park with many trails, picnic areas, and old growth forest surrounded by the Mount Hood National Forest. The main trails at this site - Cascade Streamwatch and The Wetlands trails let hikers explore the area's natural stream and wetland ecosystems in a breathtaking, scenic setting.

In winter, you'll have your pick of ski resorts - the closest being Mt. Hood Skibowl at 13 mies away, but Timberline is only a 30 minute drive, and Mt. Hood Meadows is a 45 minute drive northwest. Closer to home, there's snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in the National Forest lands, and after your outdoor adventure, come back to your cozy little cottage, put a log in the wood stove, and snuggle on the couch.

On nights you don't feel like cooking, the Rendezvous Grill is about a mile down the road in Welches for fried Willapa Bay oysters and rib-eye steak with red onion and bacon jam. But you may just be tempted to stay home most nights and enjoy sunsets and cookouts out on the deck.

Come explore the Mt. Hood area at this adorable Mt. Hood vacation cabin for two and discover all that a getaway in the Oregon mountains has to offer!

My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights after a hectic work conference. Couldn't have asked for a better, more relaxing and peaceful stay. The cabin itself was great. With the river just a few steps away, the location was perfect. Loved having coffee on the patio surrounded by trees with the river in the background. We will definitely be staying here again!

Great location very relaxing and enjoyable would highly recommend to all

We have a great stay at Pappy's Cabin and can highly recommend it!  The walk along the Sandy River is convenient and accessible.  The cabin itself is comfortable and fully equipped.  The shower pressure isn't great but the heated bathroom floor makes up for that!  The deck is situated to use the most of the sunlight...what a delight!

Very peaceful escape from the hussle and bussle of everyday life...

It was perfect for the type of getaway that was needed for the 2 of us.

Very clean.. Loved the wood stove.. The heated bathroom floor was a plus..

Falling asleep to the river every night was exhilarating!

For the price and the area, I would definitely go again and tell friends about it..

Nice cozy cabin for some much needed R&R.

We arrived to Pappy's Cabin in the middle of an intense, early-season snow event. The coziness of the cabin was immediately enjoyed as we lit our first fire in the wood-burning stove to escape the plunging temperatures. We found a mixed CD of old jazz numbers in the cabinet under the TV, moved the couch, and set up our own little dance floor to enjoy the wonderful sound system in the living room. When we woke up in the morning, the world was white but the sun was shining, and as we made our morning coffee we watched the light dance on the river just beyond the deck and snowy forest. We went hiking in the snow (powdery wonderful snow!), toasted the mountain at sunset and warmed up with hot toddies and cooked salmon on the grill. It was hard to leave such a magnificent location to go back to the "real world!"

This place is magical - highly recommended for a romantic weekend getaway.

Very well appointed small cabin, perfect for two with the sounds of the river predominant.  Less woodsy interior than some might want (lots of artificial fragrance).  Very close to neighbors, who were quiet when we visited mid-week.  We will return.

my husband and I enjoyed our stay at the cabin thoroughly and highly recommend it  . It has everything you need and the area is wonderful to explore.

Beautiful surroundings and a very pleasant little house. We had a wonderful time.

lovely cabin and quite peaceful too. Thank you

Not a huge cabin, but definitely nice for a couple's stay.  Loved the heated floors in the bathroom, accommodations were very clean and loved the washer/dryer convenience.  Thanks!

I stayed 4 days/3 nights at Pappy's Cabin.  It was quiet, cozy and relaxing.  All the items you'd expect to find in your home were already there...appliances, couch, TV and bottle opener (important!)...the ultra-soft towels, sheets and heated floors in the bathroom were just a BONUS.  The proximity of the cabin to Sandy Creek is close enough you get to hear the water flowing (especially relaxing at night with the bedroom window open).  The property itself is located down a short winding gravel road with quite a few other properties sprinkled about  on both sides, but all the trees and plant life create wonderful barriers making it feel more exclusive even though you are just off Hwy 26.  Check-in and out was a piece of cake; all done electronically. There were friendly little notes around the cabin explaining how to use the WiFi, TV and heaters...thank you!  Would definitely recommend others to stay as long as it isn't the same time as me :)

We'll be back. It was a great place for me and my husband to just unwind and relax.

Our stay was perfect at Pappy's Cabin!  Great deck near the river was wonderful.  We loved the heated floor in the bathroom.  This was a very comfortable and cozy place to stay.

It was a very peaceful cabin.  It was a good spot to rest at each night after hiking and traveling around Mt. Hood.  The kitchen was great.

Pappy's cabin has been updated so that there are vinyl windows and screens, a functioning wood stove and plenty of wood to burn, and a spotless bathroom and kitchen.  Still feels cozy with a cabin feel, and you can hear the river from the cabin.  We had a great time.  The cabin was exceptionally clean.  Only negative is that the bed is a queen, and we are used to a king so felt a little cramped, but slept well anyway!  Highly recommended.

The cabin was adorable, well stocked with kitchen supplies and very clean. Was hoping for a view of the river, but there wasn't one. It's nestled in trees however so that was beautiful. The bed was very comfortable! Only complaint was that the couch was very small and hard- not too cozy after a day of hiking. Very quiet and serene place to stay.

We had a great time here. It's everything you would hope for in a little cabin in the woods and we'll definitely go back. It's pretty, private, peaceful and right by the Sandy River, which provides the perfect white noise when you're falling asleep. There are trails nearby and it's close to a wilderness area. Its location near Welches is pretty remote (about 45 minutes from Portland), but there are stores and restaurants nearby and it's nice to be away from the city. If I had to complain, I would say, we could have used a couple extra blankets and the water pressure was real low at times (but that's only if I had to complain). Otherwise, perfect! Thanks Kurt!

I was blown away by everything about the cabin: its condition, amenities, cleanliness, location, etc. What a great find!

The cabin was immaculate and with the river rushing outside, a fire in the wood stove, and feeling wrapped up in the woods, I could not have been more peaceful and relaxed.

We had such a great time at Pappy's cabin.  Nice and cozy fireplace.  Beautiful river.  Loved the sound!  Music to the soul!

Wow! such a cute cabin but with all modern conveniences. If you plan on arriving in the dark beware as the numbers are way back on the home and could not be read clearly from the street. However, such a minor thing when everything else was delightful and absolutely spotless.

Plan some winter (or summer) fun with a stay at this two bedroom Government Camp vacation rental! Perfect for a group of friends to share, this cozy and rustic getaway has an unbeatable location right on Government Camp Loop. Walk to Summit Ski Area, restaurants, and shops. From here, you'll be only minutes away from Mt. Hood Meadows, Timberline, and Mt. Hood Skibowl. Outdoor lovers take note - this area also offers unrivaled hiking, biking, and fishing, making Government Camp a truly year-round destination.

After climbing the stairs up to your mountain retreat, you'll be rewarded with a comfortable living area with an open living room and kitchen. There's a wood stove for keeping all warm and toasty and plenty of room for everyone to spread out and relax.

The dining table is near the front deck, providing a forested view for meals or a game of cards after dinner. If you do want to stay in for dinner, the full kitchen has everything you'll need for any meal - from coffee and pancakes in the morning to a heart vegetable lasagna at night. And if you need to soak the dishes, you can always have a mug of hot cocoa in front of the fire.

Both bedrooms have twin-over-Queen bunk beds and dressers. The full bathroom has a lot of counter space for toiletries and a tub/shower combo. Altogether, this Mt. Hood cabin rental will sleep up to six guests (four adults).

This is the lower level of a duplex, and there is a shared laundry room with a washer and dryer available. From here, you can easily walk to the Govy General Store for dinner supplies or a bottle of wine. And if you don't feel like cooking, Ice Axe Grill, Charlie's Mountain View, Glacier Haus Bistro & Pizza, and other eateries are all within a couple of blocks... and although you do have a kitchen, you may find yourself having a Pork Belly Sandwich at Glacier Haus a couple of days in a row!

In ski season, Mt. Hood Skibowl, Timberline Lodge, and Mt. Hood Meadows are all just a quick drive away. And right from town, you'll be able to pick up cross-country and snowshoeing trails. Also nearby are the Mt. Hood Meadows Nordic Center, Trillium Lake Loop, and the Teacup Lake Nordic Trail.

Summer brings wildflowers, scenic trails through the Mt. Hood National Forest, and even mountain climbing at Timberline Lodge mid-April through mid-June. There's a mountain bike park at Mt. Hood Skibowl and kayaking and canoeing on Trillium, Frog, Clear, and Timothy Lakes. There's always something to do here!

Truly a four season destination, you'll feel right at home at this Government Camp getaway, whether you spend your time hiking green mountain trails or snowshoeing around a winter wonderland.

First, let me say that the staff of Vacasa was off the charts helpful! I got to Government Camp late, and although this property is conveniently located to the mountain, it was tricky to find it at night and I was getting really frustrated. I wish I could remember her name, but the woman who took my call really went out of her way to make sure I found the property and have my vacation - tracking somebody local to Government Camp to guide me to it. Great space. The only thing about it that kept it from being perfect was hearing the people walking around above me - but that's one of those "it is what it is" situations. Loved the space once I found it. And its location was excellent!

It was clean, heater works well, very good location.

Tucked beneath the trees in the Mt. Hood National Forest, just an hour east of Portland beside the Zig Zag River, lays an intimate updated mountain cabin with room for seven. Not only will your group be ideally located just 20 minutes from the slopes of Mt. Hood Meadows, Mt. Hood SkiBowl, and Timberline, but this quaint Rhododendron vacation rental will keep you warm and cozy year 'round with its private hot tub and fire pit!

Wood-paneled walls and ceilings create a true cabin feel, while modern upgrades and a thoughtful design will have you living the mountain life in style.  A gas fireplace within a beautiful stone facade in the sitting room will keep your toes warm and the ambiance inviting as you settle in with a glass of wine and some good conversation. Just above the mantle you'll find a large flat screen TV with cable so you won't have to miss your favorite late night show. Tucked in the corner you'll find a bistro table and chairs - an ideal spot for playing card games, spreading out a trail map, or keeping up with email on your laptop through the WiFi provided.

Around the corner, the compact yet fully equipped kitchen is brand new and ready to take on your homemade meals. Along with the basic necessities ñ electric stovetop, oven, microwave, and refrigerator ñ you'll also have a dishwasher to make for easy clean-up, as well as extras perks like a coffee maker, tea kettle and a slow cooker for that braised pork recipe you've been wanting to try.  Serve up your specialty on the beautiful wooden table with handmade benches and room for all seven of you.

In the warmer months you may want to move the party outside and grill up some burgers on the gas grill while soaking up that fresh mountain air. Don't forget the s'more fixings! You'll have your own fire pit to roast marshmallows and swap stories around out here too.  To top off the night, feel free to relax and star-gaze from the comfort of your private hot tub as you let the cares of your day slip away.

Back indoors, you'll find two full bedrooms and a loft on the second floor. The loft acts as a great kids' space, with a twin-over-full bunk bed and another flat screen cable TV and DVD player for movie night sleepovers. To the left is a small queen bedroom, with a platform bed and flat screen TV, and across the hall you'll find the master bedroom. Along with a plush queen bed and ceiling fan, the master bedroom offers a unique layout, with an in-room sink, stand-up shower, and toilet area for privacy and convenience. Downstairs, you'll find the second full bath and a side laundry room to help keep up with adventure soaked clothes. We know your dog loves the outdoors as much as you do, so for $10 a night, your four-legged friend can accompany you on your mountain retreat (with a $40 minimum per stay).

Though you're nestled in the forest, you won't be too far secluded to experience some mountain culture. Stop by the Zig Zag Inn for some pizza and a milkshake, or head into Skyway Bar & Grill to catch some live music.  Coffee lovers will definitely want to stop by Mt. Hood Coffee Roasters (some of the best beans around!)

While a primary reason to visit will naturally be the epic skiing found at Mt. Hood Meadows, SkiBowl, or Timberline, there's plenty to do in and around the Mt. Hood National Forest as well. Golfers (and history buffs) will enjoy rounds at The Courses, Oregon's first golf course, right next door at the Resort at the Mountain in Welches. Hiking trails are numerous throughout the National Forest, and plenty of boating, rafting and fishing opportunities can be found at the Salmon and Zig Zag rivers, as well as Mirror Lake nearby. When the snow falls, snowshoers and cross-country skiers will be in their element with plenty of terrain to traverse within minutes from your cabin. And don't forget the binoculars bird lovers ñ Rhododendron is home to two of the official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails.

Pack the skis, hiking boots, and clubs, gather up the family and get a head start on your Oregon Cascades getaway. Book this Mt. Hood vacation rental and let nature set the pace for a rejuvenating and adventure-packed mountain escape.

I would rent again. No complaints

Everything was lovely, warm and inviting.   Thanks for such superb accommodations.   We did get lost using your directions, however.  Why not add: first left after Lolo Pass Road?   We will happily stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for some peace and quiet.  iPod station - yeah!  Blender - double yeah!

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this property. This is our second vacasa rental and we've been very pleased both times. But this house was just PERFECT for us. We loved the updated amenities, everything was well placed and they had EVERYTHING we could want. We will absolutely be back. The cabin was very important as the weekend we booked wound up raining for our entire stay but we had a marvelous time anyway, a testament to the quality of this property.

The one trick with this property is the fireplace: The fireplace works great but it is tricky to get started. You need to push and hold down the pilot, spark it, then turn to the desired temp. Once you get it you're golden.

Thanks Vacasa!

We found the cabin very cozy and appointed with almost everything you need. (could have used a scrubby for washing dishes). The neighborhood was nice to walk around. We had a great time skiing x country and found a lot of beautiful trails just up the road.We definitely reccommend this property.

Pretty cabin in the woods.  Comfortable beds and clean hot tub. The cabin is well appointed and easy to get to.  A great weekend getaway.

Quiet, clean, comfortable house.  We were there during a heat wave and were able to stay comfortable with the ceiling fans and a new box fan they purchased for us.  Thank you!  We would definitely stay again.

My guests and I could not get over how clean and how well maintained this home was. It truly was a place we expect to come back to again and again. We were exceptionally happy with all the accommodations.

We stayed here for my husband's 30th birthday with our closest friends. The recent remodel is lovely. We had such a great time in the hot tub and sitting next to the fire inside and out. We enjoyed short walks to the beautiful zig zag river. We were bumbed to find no snow on our skiing trip but, being able to relax and play games in such a relaxing environment made up. We would love to stay here in future trips to Mt. Hood.

We booked the cabin with the intention of skiing but with minimal snow we ended up doing some great hiking.  The cabin was very comfortable and well planned out.  The dinning room table was great for sitting around eating dinner and playing games.  Unfortunately the hot tube had some maintenance issues and we were not able to fully enjoy it.  Overall we would recommend the cabin to others.

This is a perfect getaway cabin. Very clean and cozy with everything we could need. I will be back!

Had a great stay, wish we could have stayed longer.

We loved our stay at the Zig Zag Chalet -- it was the perfect retreat for us and our dog. The cabin appears to be recently renovated, with a great layout and pleasant  design. We found everything we needed there -- from kitchen amenities to towels and blankets to basic toiletries. The fire pit was perfect for roasting marshmallows, and the hot tub was the perfect treat after a long day of hiking. We'll definitely be back.

We were very pleased with the ZigZag Chalet.  Everything was very clean and well decorated.  The design of the chalet was well thought out.  The hot tub was clean and very private feeling.  The beds were comfortable and the linens clean and nice.  We would highly recommend this little gem in the woods!

Had a little trouble locating the site originally, but once we got there we loved it. Extremely clean and well furnished.

Having a crock pot in the kitchen was a plus.  We went exploring for the day and when we got back to the cabin the smell of the Pot Roast cooking filled the air.  Our dogs enjoyed the nice outdoor space behind the cabin.  We are looking forward to returning soon.  THANKS!

Very thoughtful design went into this cabin renovation. The wood walls, cork flooring, window treatments, great lighting and comfortable furnishings made this house feel so cozy and warm yet crisp and modern. We all slept soundly and comfortably with the quiet rush of the Zig Zag river off in the distance which also had the added benefit of drowning out any highway noise that we might have heard. Despite it's location in a relatively dense rural neighborhood just off the highway the house feels private and the dirt roads are fun to explore under the cover of tall pines. We walked down to the river and sat on an old log for awhile just taking in the warm sun, fresh air and the surrounding pine covered hillsides. This is definitely a cabin I would recommend to a small family or couple without hesitation. Can't wait for summer and a return visit!

This is one of the nicest rentals I have ever stayed in. It was great for our kids and so sweet to be able to bring our dogs.  Thank you for such a  nice place to get away with our family.

Perfect log cabin with all the cozy updates you'd want. Simple patterns, color schemes...plush bedding. Loved everything about it! Especially the fireplace and log table/end tables. Hot tub was just right. The mud room is so convenient for winter weather and storing all of your wet ski/snowboard items. A word to the wise..........it was hard to find Tamarack St in the dark!! Once you do, directions are easy. Highly recommend!

We really enjoyed staying at this cabin. It is absolutely adorable in the inside, and everything we needed was provided for us in the cabin.  It has a great cabin rustic feel to it & would love to come back again!

We loved this cabin and had a lot of fun.  The cabin is very fun and comfortable and the bedding/linens are great!  We loved all the cozy blankets that they had for us to use in the living room and the big rustic wood table makes gathering around with a group perfect for games!

This serene Mount Hood vacation home is a pastoral refuge nestled on four, forested acres just ten minutes from Rhododendron, but with a wonderful sense of peace, quiet, and privacy. With room for eight, every detail of this lovely cabin evokes the lush woodland visible through all the big windows. And from the comfort of the wicker chair out on one of the decks, you'll also have a front row seat on the idyllic little pond in back.

After a day of floating on a kayak or teasing the rushing waters of the nearby Sandy River with the new lures you've tied, this living room is geared for relaxation! Dinner's not quite ready, so take off your shoes and take a load off on the sofa, love seat, or armchair, each with its own built-in recliner. Nights can be chilly on beautiful Mount Hood, but you'll be snug and warm after you bring that fresh log to a blaze in the oversized wood stove, perched on its own stone pedestal. Start a game of chess or one of the many games available in the cabinet. Internet is provided, but please note there is a daily limit on usage and it should not be depended on for extensive use.

Meals will be easy in this fully equipped kitchen, complete with gas stove, double fridge, and a dishwasher, so there's less time by the sink. It's a bright space, with sunlight from the window, a skylight, and overhead track lighting. And there's plenty of counter space to for prepping those veggies. When it's all done, sit down at the table for eight where you'll eat and imbibe from brightly colored stoneware and modern wine glasses. Weather permitting, bring some steaks, hot dogs or salmon to sizzling perfection on the gas grill, stoke the fire in the outdoor firepit, and enjoy your meal outside with s'mores for dessert!

Each of Red Relaxer's three bedrooms share one thing: green. Whether it's a green rug, curtain, or the length of pine branches strung along the bed canopy, the theme is "forest", and the art and rustic furniture underscore it. In addition to the queen bed and attached full bath in the master suite, there's a handsome roll-top desk, an easy chair, and a queen futon. There's a queen bed with rough-hewn log frame adorned with pine branches in the second bedroom, and, finally, two twins in the third bedroom. A second full bathroom is available to everyone. And, pack light: there's also a washer and dryer.

The mornings are especially peaceful here: at the Red Relaxer you will wake up to the sound of gently gurgling streams and the rustling of cedars - never the sound of traffic going by or ski boots tromping on stairs!

As one of the communities located along the Mount Hood Scenic Byway, little Rhododendron shares the natural beauty and wealth of recreational activities you'll find everywhere in the Mount Hood area. Rhododendron is located near five state parks and the enormous Mount Hood National Forest, so there are plenty of places to hike and bike. Not only is the Sandy River nearby, but the town is also minutes from the Salmon River and Steel Creek, so it's not surprising that Rhododendron is a fly-fishing mecca. If you're an amateur (or a professional!) ornithologist, you're in the right place! Two of the official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails are nearby. There's plenty of golfing in Welches, and, in winter, skiers and boarders will be close to five resorts, including Mount Hood Meadows, just a half-hour away.

So come to this beautiful cottage in the woods just minutes from Rhododendron. Enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with four secluded acres, the convenience of all the amenities you could ask for, and access to all the sites and recreational options waiting for you in the gorgeous Mount Hood region!

It is clear that the owner and his family have had wonderful times at their Red Retreat. Their book with suggested activities and surrounding areas of interest was so special. We did have a great time and enjoyed their welcoming messages that made us feel like family.

Me and few friends of ours came here for the labor day weekend.. what a fantastic stay it was.. the house is fully furnished and has all thats required to spend time in the woods... the fireplace deck and the side deck were perfect for evenings and early mornings respectively.. i would love to come back here anytime..

The red relaxer was a perfect place for two families to stay and play in the snow for a weekend.  20 minutes from good alpine skiing, great amenities for afterwards (fireplace, etc).  The kitchen was clean and well stocked.  Bathrooms were clean and comfortable.  Plenty of bed space for all and a very comfortable living area.  We would love to return in the summer to enjoy some of the outside amenities more and do some hiking.

Really enjoyed out stay at the red relaxer. It was very beautiful. The home was very comfortable, at first the furniture looks outdated but don't be fooled when you sit in those clean chairs and couches you melt and never want to get back up while the fire is going in the back. Just an amazing place and would come back to the red relaxer for sure.

Kitchen had everything and more and the bedrooms were cozy and comfortably warm on those cold nights.

Loved the place.

A  get away private dream!

This was the perfect secluded get away! No noise, sounds of nature abound and the home is nestled among old growth trees! Magical and relaxing!

The location, the cabin and its spaciousness and great furnishings and comfort.....great beds...especially enjoyed the nice outdoor spaces...deck and porch ....great supplies...everything we needed for a wonderful weekend!

You'll have a taste of Bavaria when you stay at this German-themed, chalet-sytle Government Camp vacation rental with room for six within walking distance of Skibowl Ski Resort and the shops, restaurants and activities in and around Government Camp. After a tiring but fun day on the slopes, come out of the snow, slip the car in the double-deep garage, stow the equipment, and gather 'round the fireplace with a mug of your favorite Lager.

Located in Collins Lake Resort, it's just an hour's drive from Portland. When you stay at this chalet with room for six, you'll enjoy Alpen ambiance in the shadow of Oregon's Mount Hood.

There is comfy new furniture in the living room and there is even a new 50" Plasma TV with cable, so you won't miss the latest episode of your favorite mini-series. Bring along a couple of your favorite DVDs, fill a bowl with some snacks, and enjoy a movie. Or, bring up the free internet and plan your next day's activities in the abundant, Mount Hood area. The owner has provided some DVDs, games and a guitar for your enjoyment as well.  If it's warm enough, head on out to the deck and savor the spectacular view as you fire up the gas grill for a barbeque.

Your designated chefs can make everything from spaetzle to spinach in the full kitchen with lots of counter space for prep work, and the chore of cooking might seem a little less tedious with each look out the kitchen window, where they'll have a great view of Mount Hood. Serve it up at the wooden table with three chairs and a bench. The collection of steins might just make you feel like you're in a Gasthaus in Munich.

This chalet has two bedrooms, both upstairs. In one, you'll find a queen bed, in the other, two twins. At bedtime the kids can scurry up to the loft and pull out the twin trundle bed for a night's sleep. There are two full bathrooms upstairs, and a half-bath downstairs.

The garage is set up with a ski waxing station and even has a fooseball table and a dart board for entertainment after you hit the slopes!

Government Camp isn't just for winter. Sure, there's Skibowl, Mount Hood Meadows, and plenty of other places to play in the white stuff. But any time of year you can get a little bit of history by trekking up to Timberline Lodge, an historic legacy of  Depression Era architecture. Learn even more about Mount Hood's colorful past at the Mount Hood Cultural Center, right in Government Camp. In summer, Mount Hood is a haven for hiking, rafting, cycling, fishing, and much more. Or, just hang out at the Creekside Lodge where you'll find two hot tubs, a year-round pool with heated decks, and a beautiful clubhouse where you can lounge in front of the great stone fireplace with a book or a laptop.

Whatever season, whatever your idea of fun, this charming, Collins Lake vacation rental can accommodate you.

Really well appointed. Bright and airy. Nice furnishings. Beds are a little mushy.

I have stayed at Collins Lake Resort and number of time and all booked through Vacasa. This particular unit just wasn't up to the other units I've stayed at. Not as comfortable or cozy. But, it won't keep us from staying at this resort again, we just wouldn't stay in this particular unit.  Thank you

This was a great and comfortable condo.  I love it to be warm in the place, but this was a little extreme, especially upstairs.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this property was set up.  Immediately when parking the car in the HEATED garage I got the feeling the rest of the place was going to be wonderful.  AND IT WAS!    Thank you for providing absolutely EVERYTHING.  The kitchen equipment/utensils/cookware, etc.. left me not needing or wanting anything at all.   The property is beautiful inside and out.  Loved the outdoor hot tub in the center of the tall snow covered Douglas Fir trees!  Thanks for providing all the necessary soaps, shampoos, detergents.  I hope to return to the exact same unit next year!   Just want to let you know that the guitar has a few strings broken; but, it is still a nice touch to have it there in the first place.  Please thank the owners for sharing  their unit with us.  They gave my family a wonderful holiday.

We really enjoyed this condo. The dryer came in handy after a day skiing in the rain. Liked the living area being in a separate floor from the sleeping area. Would stay there again.

Suggestion 1) Please make sure there are darts available for the dartboard.

2) Explain that discounted Meadows ski tickets must be ordered in advance, not day of.

Great place for a family get-away or guys weekend out to ride mountain bikes. Vacasa made the entire booking, check-in and check-out process extremely easy. I've stayed here in the past for mountain bike races and will continue to stay here in the future. Good times!

What a beautiful home in a great location!  We loved it and plan on going back again in the winter for skiing.

It was a great place for folks who are here to enjoy mountain activities but don't want an actual place in nature. I prefer a more secluded space surrounded by trees, but my friends from Chicago loved it. The levels were great to accommodate different ages with different bedtimes. The pool and hot tub were awesome.

This condo is well appointed, clean and comfortable. I stayed for 2 1/2 weeks and cooked and/or barbecued almost every meal at home. I will definitely be looking for this one again next summer.

There was a mix of family and partiers around.  The pool area was abused a bit by a younger set that were drinking a bit too heavily.  Could use and occasional attendant around to keep things a bit more under control, at least until 9pm or or so.

We were very happy with the condo.  Plenty of room, very well maintained, loaded with all of the necessities needed to make our visit go well.  We are already looking forward to a return visit.  Our 17 year old son and his friend too advantage of the close ski slopes, your hot tub and the walking distance to the shops and great restaurants.   Thank you!

We had a great time.  The location in Collins Lake was perfect.  Wish we could have stayed longer!

We were in town for a conference at Timberline, and we greatly enjoyed our stay.  It's a well furnished home, and the pictures don't capture the beauty.  It's quite close to the hot tub & pool, and it's a quick walk to downtown Government Camp.  This home also has wifi which is a plus.

Condo was lovely, clean and beds were very comfortable; well stocked kitchen, and the hot tub was a nice plus! I would definitely return

We were part of a large wedding guest group and it was great for everyone to be able to stay within the same condo complex. #104 was super clean, well furnished and spacious, nice views off the deck and within walking distance of the business area of Government Camp.  In preparing for the wedding it would have been nice to have a working Iron, the Iron we found in the garage looked like something from the 1950's. Great unit, would stay again.

The unit was clean and had everything that you would need. Government camp is a great location both for skiing in the winter and for access to beautiful hikes in the summer. Comfortably fit my family of four as well as my wife's parents (4 adults and 2 kids in the bunk room).

Clean, organize, all what you need in the unit; a little bit dark. In door pool would be better

Loved the plush white bath towels and the abundance of them. Also, all the toiletries, cleaning supplies, and paper goods were plentiful. Usually in a rental, these amenities are in short supply, but here it was bountiful. My only "wish" was that there were some more cooking dishes. We had to borrow a soup pot and a baking dish to make our meals.

We really enjoyed this condo.  It exceeded our expectations and we would stay again.  The Vacasa staff was very prompt and professional.

A very comfortable beautiful house to come and relax at. Kids loved the woods and the play room and the hot tub.

We had an overall good time here with the family. It's a beautiful house and area. With the plumbing issues we had and the cleanliness of the hot tub I would have hoped for a partial refund as I think for the price you shouldn't have to deal with such issues. The kitchen could use a little more dishes for bigger groups.

This was a beautiful home. If had all of the amenities of a home plus a few extras such as a game room, hot tub, sauna etc. the woodwork is throughout the home making you feel like you're vacationing somewhere in the deep wilderness but your just minutes away from Mt Hood activities. A must see!

The house is beautiful and the area is great, but there are things that need to be fixed or maintained better.  Hot tub was very dirty with yellow slime, the toilet is more than "sensitive" as noted in the manual and overflowed right away, and there is a broken sewage pipe in the back yard that spurts onto the  lawn every time the toilet is flushed.  Yes, it stinks. There was also a missing panel on the kitchen cabinet at the sink, limited cleaning supplies, and a broken pocket on the pool table with deck screw poking out from some trying to fix it. Overall, the unit was clean, very spacious, and decorated in a very tasteful, welcoming, and cozy manner. The fire place doesn't work, but at least that had a note above it so we knew right away.  Probably wouldn't go back, but we still enjoyed Family time and made the best of it.

Overall we were happy with our stay at this cabin. The interior of the home was clean and comfortable, and the upstairs game room was a hit. The beds were comfy and the sheets were nice. The kitchen was nice, although it was lacking in some important items to cook a proper meal. There were no bowls for mixing and there were no pots. Plenty of skillets, but no pot to bowl water or cook pasta.  The setup of the cabin was great for our family. Although it sleeps 10 people, I wouldn't recommend this cabin for multiple families as there is only 1 bathroom. Our biggest complaint was the exterior. Weeds growing tall as you walk up to the front door- which is weird because it's actually in the back of the house. The front step was dirty with junk stacked up to one side- not inviting at all and forms a bad first impression. The backyard was overgrown and a complete mess. Clearly the yard is an after thought at best. The firepit was functional, but could be more appealing with better furniture- we just moved the chairs from the deck down to sit around the fire.  For the price of this cabin, you would think a little more care would go into the exterior and the kitchen stock. I'm writing this review because I always look at reviews from others before renting a place, and there was only 1 on this cabin with no comments. Hoping to help another family who might wish to stay here. I would recommend this cabin since the interior was nice and functional, but I would warn you not to expect too much on the exterior!

I am half tempted to give a bad review just so the place is always available for our family to stay at. But I can't do that. The place is perfect. Rustic on the outside yet modern on the inside. Great view of Mt. Hood from the front porch. Very private location that is not far from anything. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the kids loved exploring the woods. Highly recommend Capstone Lodge and thank the owners for allowing our family to enjoy a great vacation.

Nestled among the trees in a secluded area of Welches, with no Internet or cable, this Welches vacation rental offers a sacred space to reconnect with your loved ones with few distractions and plenty of natural beauty.

While cozy enough for an intimate group of friends or family, this two-story, three bedroom, two bath Red Stone Cabin is deceptively large, and can comfortably accommodate a group of up to six to eight guests. There is a $20 per person charge over six people.

Mountain decor and warm woods throughout offer a rustic yet comforting appeal.

An open and welcoming kitchen is well-stocked and ready for any culinary dish you wish to create, while the dishwasher makes clean-up a breeze (we don't want you to rough it TOO much!). Ample counter space and an eat-in bar seating all ten guests makes this an ideal spot for entertaining and catching up with the cooks while they prep.

The bedrooms are arranged on one side of the home, away from the living spaces, allowing those who tucker out more quickly than others to peacefully retreat into dreamtime while the others linger over a bottle of wine and a long conversation.

Upstairs, the third bedroom holds a quilted king-sized bed set back in a wooden enclave that will envelope you in rustic mountain ambiance. Tucked against the back wall of this room, in a snug den of its own, is a twin bed with a dresser and vanity.  An additional futon mattress in this room makes it an ideal space for a family toting along a child or two.

The star feature of the Redstone cabin will be your own private outdoor fire pit in the back yard: a perfect place to swap stories passed down by generations while you roast marshmallows under the moonlight. While forest fire risks & local ordinance unfortunately means campfires aren't allowed from June - September, you can still lounge on the large deck while you grill up the catch of the day on the gas grill.

This cozy cabin offers gorgeous views of Huckleberry Mountain that will entice the explorer at heart to come out and play. And what a playground you'll find in the Mt. Hood National Forest! Redstone is just 20-35 minutes from prime skiing or snowboarding at SkiBowl, Meadows, or Timberline, as well as stellar hiking through the Salmon Huckleberry Wilderness area, and over 70 miles of trailheads.

For the fisherman or woman, the Salmon River is an excellent source of steelhead and chinook and coho salmon. The home is also adjacent to the Resort at the Mountain for excellent golfing, while a variety of restaurants and shops lie within a few minutes drive from the home.

Whether you're interested in a romantic couples' getaway, family reunion, writing or artists' retreat, or simply a much needed escape from the hustle and bustle of the work world, this three bedroom Mt. Hood vacation cabin rental will be your haven in the woods.

There were so many nice touches - soaps in the bathroom and showers, every type of dishes, well labeled cupboards and light switches.  It was a great place to refill our cups after the business of the previous travel days.

Every year we get a different cabin up at Mt. Hood for Christmas. Every year it has been pleasant except for this one. I don't know where to begin. They have a single gas stove to heat the entire living quarters. When we arrived it was 42 degrees in the place. It took over 6 hours to get the place warmed up to 70 degrees. And for the rest of our 3 nights stay we spent at least an hour a day messing with the thermostat that is attached to the stove to keep the stove running and the home heated. It was a daily battle and concern if we would be able to stay warm for the night.

The beds were horrible. Old and uncomfortable. The sheets were even worse, old flannel sheets at least 10 years old, the were rough and pilled up. The down comfortor had to be removed from the bed after I found blood stains on it. The list really goes on and on. It just felt like they took no pride in the details that truly matter to a guest. Needless to say, we will not be back.

This was the perfect place for a quiet, relaxing getaway. There's plenty to do nearby but the cabin offers a comfortable, private location to just relax and enjoy the quiet.

We stayed here last year, too.  We like the number of beds and the open design of the cabin - lots of room to move around.  The deck area is good.  What we really appreciate is all of the kitchen items at our disposal - coffee maker, microwave, tons of pots/pans, etc.  It is also a good launch place for wandering around the beautiful Mt. Hood area.

Bathroom layout not ideal unless you are one big happy family. (Only one bath available without walking through a bedroom.) Otherwise very pleasant.

The maintenance staffs were really helpful. We came prepared for grilling and saw that the BBQ equipment ran out of propane. Soon after a call this was immediately fixed and everything was ready when we came back in the evening.  We stayed here for couple of nights and its perfect stay for a group of 10. Kids really enjoyed and the property was well furnished with lots of stuff in the kitchen, clean towels in plenty.

Wonderful cabin with a nice layout.  Blankets, pillows, and a full kitchen already provided.  Showers were wonderful after two full days of playing on Mt. Hood.  Only 20-25 minutes from Mt. Hood Meadows, and even closer to the the other resorts.

Highly recommend and will return again.  We had a full 10 people and still plenty of room.

Large cabin with plenty of space and well stocked kitchen for cooking, and the binder listing hikes around the area was terrific. Very private location.

Our stay was so very nice!  We loved the privacy of this property.

We really loved this cabin, it was exactly how I had hoped it would be.  Very comfortable.  We intertubed at Government Camp, roasted marshmellows around the fire pit, and just really relaxed and enjoyed ourselves!

We really enjoyed the house and location. Having the fireplace going when we arrived really started our stay off right. It was a very comfortable homey house with everything we needed. More snow would have been nice :):)

This is a delightful large cabin about 12 miles from Mt. Hood (Government Camp). A large kitchen, well stocked with dishes and appliances. A large open living/kitchen area, perfect for a gathering of probably 4-10 people. The only problem we had was not being able to get the gas fireplace lit, which was the main source of heat for the house. The management was not able to get anyone to come out to fix this problem for the length of our 48 hour stay. Fortunately, the weather was warm enough so this was not as much of a problem for us, though a fire would have been a nice addition. There are several restaurants in the area as well as a large resort that offers a golf course and a fine restaurant. I would recommend this lovely cabin as a family retreat or to those who want to stay in the beautiful Mt. Hood area.

This was a wonderful place for our family to gather.  Very kid-friendly with just the right amount of space for our two families.  Two of the beds were very creaky, though.  Loved the proximity to the Salmon River recreation area and the location was quiet.  Thank you for sharing your space!

We celebrated my daughters upcoming wedding. The house was so comfortable.Very spacious with homey decor. We hiked around Mirror Lake and ate at The Rondevouz restaurant. And the weather was amazingly sunny! We all agreed to come back and enjoy  a winter holiday. It was a very memorable stay for us.Thankyou!

My son and I take his two sons to this cabin (our 2nd time)and it is great for the two boys. They feel at home there.

This Cabin was our home base during our anual end of the year skiing photoshoot at timberline. It is close to the main road and the grocery store as well as several good places to grab a bite to eat. Would recomend this home to friends coming up for similar reasons.

Great house!  It was just two of us, but this would be a great house for a group of people.  I need to stay here again in the summer to enjoy the great secluded deck and firepit!

The home was very nice. My concerns were the carpets need to be more secure. Tripping hazard. Master bedroom should have 1 king bed. It would open it up.If there was snow in driveway. It would have been a concern getting in and out safely. We loved the house inside and out. Thank you and we look forward to staying again.

Boasting peaceful ocean bluffs, rugged coastlines, and shop-filled beach towns, a stay at one of our Northern California Coast vacation rentals has something for everyone. These classic small coastal towns hugging the Pacific Coast offer a chance to unwind amidst unspoiled beauty, towering redwoods, and thriving artists' communities. Mendocino county is only about a three hour drive from all of the hubbub in San Francisco, but it feels like entering a completely different world! You'll discover award-winning wineries, picturesque hiking trails, and one-of-a-kind woodworking galleries when you plan a stay in one of these charming coastal towns.

The bustling city of Fort Bragg lies only 240 miles from the Oregon border. With plenty of shops and galleries, as well as the beach to explore, you'll never run out of things to do in this bustling town.

Just 10 miles south of Fort Bragg is quaint, Victorian-esque Mendocino, California. Spend the day walking along the trails in the spectacular Mendocino Headlands State Park, pick up some local cream cheese and freshly baked bread at the local grocery co-op, or browse new releases at the Mendocino Book Company. This charming, historic town is filled with unique water towers, flower gardens, and award-winning restaurants.

If you're looking for a slightly quieter escape than either Fort Bragg or Mendocino, just two miles further south down California's scenic Highway 1 is Little River. Situated between Mendocino and Van Damme State Park, Little River is right near the action, but with a slightly more relaxed pace. Here, you can spend your days combing Van Damme Beach for shells, diving for abalone, or just taking in the gorgeous ocean views from the bluff. And if you want to head into Mendocino for supplies or a special dinner out, you're just minutes away.

The hamlet of Albion is the perfect place to unwind and relax. Take in the old growth redwoods, majestic ocean views, and breathe in the fresh ocean air - all while being only 25 minutes south of bustling Fort Bragg.

If you blinked while traveling further south down Highway 1, you might just miss the tiny, postcard-perfect, rugged cliff-side town of Elk. With a couple of inns, restaurants, and a gas station, Elk may be small in size but it's big on things to do. In this quiet community where the forests and meadows meet the sea, you can take a yoga or Pilates class at the Greenwood School or attend the Community Pizza Baking event the fourth Saturday of every month - just bring your own dough and toppings and bake your pie in a shared, wood-fired outdoor oven!

Whether you spend your California getaway browsing galleries, wine tasting, visiting artist's studios, or simply taking photos from the bluff, your stay at a Northern California Coast vacation rental will be unique and memorable! Come see why this section of rocky coastline is one of the most beautiful places in the world.

the house was set up for very comfortable living; furnishings were charming; it really felt like a home away from home. next time we go to Mendocino, we will check its availability

The website, description, and pics do not do this place justice. This is a beautiful and very comfortable home. It would fit 2 couples very nicely, or a four member family along with two grandparents very comfortably. Minutes from downtown Mendo. Views are spectacular from several rooms and the deck.

We always enjoy our trips to the Mendocino  area and this time was especially  nice. The house was very  comfortable  and well  stock. The kitchen  had everything  we needed  to cook meals and the house was furnished  quiet nicely. The kids enjoyed  the WiFi. Over all the best place we have stay in Mendocino. Close to town but very  quiet and peaceful. Definitely  looking forward  to coming  back.

This is a wonderful Mendocino vacation rental.  The pluses:  beautiful view (although has a road with traffic in front of the property - not clear from pictures), close to town, bedrooms don't share walls so nice and quiet; well-stocked kitchen equipment-wise and gas fireplace.  Minuses:  uncomfortable Murphy beds in two rooms; no king beds and no twin beds.  The road to town in front of the house has very little shoulder so dangerous to walk to town.

You can't beat the view of the white water and the Headlands from the house and the deck. The home is very warm and cozy and has  everything you need. We loved our stay and will be back. R & S

The Headlands was a great place to call home for a month.  The views were amazing..sunsets galore and Wales every day!  The home was well equipped for home cooking and nice thick clean towels for your showers.  The location worked very well for us and the guests we had visit loved it...cocktails on the deck watching sunsets. The house  had everything we needed. Our only disappointment was that the beds could have been a bit more comfy but they were OK.  We would definitely stay there again and everyone we had to work with was a pleasure.

Beautiful and spacious house, amazing views, we loved gas log fireplace, steam shower and whirlpool bathtub. :-)  Just note that you do have to drive to get everywhere if only for a few minutes.

We had a great time with our granddaughter, daughter and grandparents at this charming cottage.  it was perfect for us.  I hope we can come back to this great place again.  Special memories for all of us.

The house is very well supplied with top quality dishes and utilities and the furnishings are very comfortable and of high quality.

Loved the location / Views from the deck.  Very roomy for the 4 of us, 2 adults, our teenage son and Gpa.  Easy walk to town -- although there is not much of a shoulder to walk on so care is needed.

This home was a lovely place for our large family.  Although we were unable to get to the beach without taking our car, the home was lovely.  The views outstanding and so was the garden.  It was quite private and cozy.  All members of the family were comfortable during our stay.  Although the information states there are games to play we could not find any.  Puzzles, yes,,....but games no.  Overall, a great place to relax and enjoy the ocean and garden views.  Proximity to the town of Mendocino and Ft. Bragg is great.

A GREAT view of the ocean, but if you're into walking you need to know in advance that there isn't a very easy way to access the beach.  My husband and I did it but in most cases people will have to drive to wherever they wish to go to access the headlands/beach.  Lovely place otherwise.  REALLY enjoyed our stay with spectacular views of the ocean!

We loved our experience in the house, it's a beautiful property and if you walk around the grounds, it's as though you have your own private botanical gardens tour! Fairly easy 10 minute walk to town or out to the bluffs, beautiful views and a great kitchen.

We were very pleased with the condition of the home, the furnishings, the fully-stocked kitchen, and the very comfortable beds. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in this beautiful vacation rental and will be staying there again on our next trip!

The house, location were lovely! We did have several issues thi! The bed in the master bdrm was the most uncomfortable bed we ever attempted to sleep on! It was noisy (springs etc.) lumpy, and we constantly woke each other up everytime we moved! I ended up sleeping on a chair in the lvrm, my husband on the floor. Why would you put in a wall bed when uhave so much space in that room for a wonderful bigger bed? It was a big rm with much wasted space! The only comfortable bed was with the view! The micro wave didn't work and we couldn't call to report because we had no cell service and no car to go to town to call. Only 4 rolls of toilet paper for 6 people for 3 days; there was an inside light in the little cabin right nxt to it that stayed on and ruined being able to sit outside on the deck in the evening; we were Blasted with light! We really enjoyed the rest of the house but could not recommend it because of the really uncomfortable beds in the two other bedrms! Would highly recommend a redue on that! thanks..

This home has excellent white water views and is located close to town (but walking in is ill advised given no shoulders on Lansing St.) Practical floor plan and some nice touches but maintenance and cleanliness not what it should be.   Just a little more sprucing and attention and this property would be an exceptional value.

Imagine a home filled with wonderful delights..sumptious furnishings, firelight accompanied by surf symphonies, botanical diversity to delight any gardener, crashing surf views inside and out, steamy full body showers and claw tub soaks..and you're in the Vacasa's Headlands Cove Mendocino. This is a vacation with something for everyone in your group. Fine eating and shopping, natural wonders at your doorstep, unique coastal towns within 15 minutes by car, the historic lighthouse gleaming on restored grounds, the amazing Botanical Garden of enchantment, and the wonderful salty smell of the mighty Pacific combined with centuries old Cypress trees embedding itself in your senses..it all awaits you here.

This home has the perfect location close to town with wonderful views.  The home is nicely furnished and had everything we needed.  The gardens have the most interesting plants.  We're looking forward to a return trip next spring.

We enjoyed our stay at the house very much. The views were beautiful and the house very cozy. Enjoyed walking just a few minutes to the Headlands Park and trails. Will definitely stay at this house again. It was a wonderful girls weekend just not long enough !

We have rented several homes in Mendocino over the years and this experience was very enjoyable. Perfect size, location and Vacasa response. Liked the lock box with no keys to worry about!

Beautiful area, charming house, neat town, but the house is outdated in many ways. Still, overall great place and we enjoyed our stay.

We really enjoyed our stay here and will be back. It was perfect for a long weekend

and could look at that view all day long.

Loved the location and the views, which were even better than pictured on the website.  Really appreciated the well-stocked kitchen, with every imaginable cooking implement, it made it quite enjoyable to cook at the house.  Had everything we needed.  Comfortable house, nice layout.  Everyone enjoyed it immensely and we hope to return in the future!  I will definitely recommend this house to friends, it's a gem in a great location.  Thank you!

We loved the house. The ocean view was spectacular. The flowers in landscape were beautiful. The steam shower was an added bonus. We spent much of our time on the back deck looking at the ocean.

The location of the house was just minutes from  Mendocino and Fort Bragg.

Mendocino and surrounding area are great.  We have been coming up here for over 20 years and have stayed at Fairy Ring Cottage a half dozen times.

The view of the ocean is spectacular and the property's strongest asset.

The short hike to the Cove is covered in blackberries - a nice treat!  The Cove is quiet and spectacular.  We enjoyed the company of a molting elephant seal while we were there.  Walking to the lighthouse along the cliffs is just gorgeous.

It was literally just a walk out the door and around the corner to go hike in Russian Gulch State Park--a beautiful, lush and interesting place where the Redwoods meet the water.

the house has really nice large lot and beach walking distance

Great decks, Mendo coast and local rivers are the best.  Patterson's Pub is a great food , beverage, sports and music joint. Lots of locals and travelers.

Nice walk to Point Cabrillo lighthouse -- also easy access to downtown Mendocino

The Mendocino Headlands are spectacular! Jug Handle beach is a gem and we enjoyed Russian Gulch State Park. Little River Restaurant was delicious.

walking around the Mendocino village and closely observing the interesting architecture and lovely gardens.

Caspar beach is a great place to just sit and unwind!!

The caspar beach as well as the almost private beach (no sand just rocks) nearby are spectacular. We walked over there and enjoyed the sunsets there.

Russian Gulch State Park was walking distance and Pt Cabrillo Lighthouse a short drive. Perfect location for a long week end on the Mendocino Coast.

The highlights of our trip were: the Skunk Train Ride, a drive north thru the Avenue of the Giants, riding horse on the beach and the woods, and you gotta taste the ice cream at  Cowlicks on Main Street - then go back to the cabin and enjoy the wonderful hot tub!!  :)

Russian Gulch was a fun place to hike around and visit.

The Mendocino Cafe was wonderful.  Walking the Botanical Garden in Fort Bragg was amazing.

Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens (always beautiful), Pygmy Forest (great, easy hiking), MacCallum House (yummy dinner, great ambiance by the fire, but pricey), MacKerricher State Park, Noyo Harbor (lunch at The Wharf restaurant overlooking the harbor was delightful).

Pacific Star Winery, 12 miles past Fort Bragg.  Amazing views.  Bring a picnic lunch and buy a bottle of wine to enjoy while you look for whales off shore.  We saw a mother and her calf!

We loved being near the natural preserve,  beach and lighthouse.  A truly wonderful place to wind down and enjoy all the beautiful things Mother Nature has to offer.

The headlands and the coast north and south of Mendo are always spectacular! Wine availability in the area is second to none. Hiking is plentiful and usually takes you to another beautiful spot.

The waterfall loop trail at Russian Gulch State Park was awesome, and the bluff trail at Point Cabrillo Light Station State Park (right next door) was breathtaking!

Big River Beach, Jug Handle State Preserve, the town of Mendocino.

Dramatic views of the coast, excellent hiking trails along the cliffs

Restaurants in Mendocino: 955 (955 Ukiah St), Cafe Beaujolais

Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens

Yes.  You should mention the walking path starting at the end of Vega Drive that leads to Point Cabrillo Lighthouse.  Beautiful walk (where we learned about the "Frolic" reference).

Also, the town of Mendocino was charming and the Mendocino Headlands State Park was great.

Three tiny notes about the home: couldn't fully open the left blind in the master bedroom, the mattress perhaps should be replaced and you may want to mention that there are 4 thermostats.  Otherwise...perfection!

Hot tub a plus!  Great location! All around very nice!

Cafe bojoulaise was very good. Great ambience and garden.

The lighthouse and museum at Point Cabrillo Light Station and museum/gift shop. The Headlands beaches. Silver's at the Wharf Restaurant in Fort Bragg.  Harvest Markets (Mendocino & Fort Bragg)

the hike up to the waterfall in russian gulch park

It's all great.  In addition to the Headlands, we like the Pt.Cabrillo lighthouse, the Botanical Gardens and Glass Beach in Fort Bragg.

Try the Trillium Restaurant on Kasten St.

The Bead Shop. The Blow Hole. The Beach at the mouth of the Navarro River.

The house itself was inviting, comfortable, spacious, simply appointed, to our liking. The kitchen had everything we needed. Thank you!

Mendo has a wonderful performing arts center. We got to see "Gaslight" while there.

A bit of a drive, but the Pier Chowder House in Point Arena has amazing beer-battered rock cod. The beach north in Westport is a hidden gem!

The location is very convenient.  The Headlands State Park, the Van Dame, the Russian Gulch, and many other attractions are within 5-mile radius.

Mackerriker state park for tide pools & whale watching & picnic Jug handle park waterfall, Big River Beach, Davids Restaurant for all day breakfast, Mini Golf in Fort Bragg.

Beautiful view and easy location for getting around Mendocino.

Catch a canoe is a great place to rent canoes for the kids.  Staff was quite helpful and knowledgeable.

The views of the sea lion colony and rocks from the headlands walk across the road.

Whale spout watching from the deck was amazing experience!

Point Cabrillo Lighthouse and Mendocino Headlands.

Also dinner at Mendo Bistro in Fort Bragg is excellent.

Goodlife Cafe and Bakery had excellent lunch choices, but it was the bakery items that really pleased the kids!

Point Cabrillo Lighthouse is a walk or short drive away, with lovely trails and sights.  I loves listening to the sea lions at night.

My boyfriend and I  explored around Main Street and had fun getting to know the locals at Dick's Bar. We also had lunch at the Mendocino Cafe which had a nice patio. We had some incredible fish at Wild Fish as well.

Loved visiting the nearby parks, hiking and watching for whales.

The rock island with the Sea Lion colony was amazing

Caspar Beach was wonderful. Trillium Restaurant very nice. in Anderson Valley, golden eye Winery is very high quality.

Ledford House for dinner was amazing, and thanks to Harvest Market who was the only place open during an 18 hour power outage.  The groceries and the staff were also excellent.  We enjoyed walking on the headlands.

Glass Beach was wonderful, and a woman's clothing shop in Mendocino, "The Great Put On," some beautiful clothes and very lovely staff.

Botanical Gardens- lovely walking paths , nothing in bloom at the time but still lovely. Great views of the ocean waves and lucky enough to get see whales playing and surfacing.

Dick's place makes the best bloody mary.

Hot tub at night  to see the spectacular star show above.

We walked to the lighthouse from the parking lot and it was worth the walk,  we also drove north to Mckerricher State park and walked out on the boardwalk to the ocean, the views from both places were  great..  We did see a few whale spouts, which was enjoyable.

Walk the Headlands

Visit the town and the shops

Have breakfast at Flow overlooking the ocean

Have a nightcap at Mendocino  Hotel

Take a drive up to Ft Bragg, lots there

Catch a canoe and a bike too was the best place we stopped at. They had the best pricing and were very friendly.

We ate at the MacCallum House three times and enjoyed each visit.  We also love the Good Life Cafe.  Great hikes in the Pigmey Forest.  Also liked Piaci's in Ft. Bragg and walking the Haul Road.

Such a great location if you have a dog.! Lots of outside area for them to run around and very safe!

We  had a wonderful time at Casper beach.  The kids enjoyed exploring up the road and the surrounding redwood forest.

The walks along the cliffs were wonderful!

This is our 4th time at Crane Dance, so we have come to know and love Cafe Beaujolais, Trilium (used to be Moosse Cafe), the Botanical Garden, Russian Gulch, Jug Handle, Big River, walking to the lighthouse etc etc.

The lighthouse was pretty neat, and we enjoyed Van Damme Park.

We rode the Skunk Train- Christmas Train for the holidays & enjoyed shopping in the town of Mendocino.

Big River, Van Damme, Russian Gulch, McKerricher. Nice restaurants in Ft. Bragg: Mendo Bistro, The Restaurant, Cucina Verona. Tangents in Ft. Bragg is fun!

In addition to Mendocino, Glass Beach at Fort Bragg is a unique and beautiful place to visit.

We love just to walk around town and check out the Headlands .  The view of the ocean from the town is breath taking.

Beautiful forest location. Nice for a change from oceanfront properties.

Bonus if you like looking for mushrooms as well! A minute from town, but isolated and very private.

We go for the pristine, rugged and breath-taking coast.  Everything else is a bonus.

It is a beautiful area you can't go wrong. We enjoyed driving around Anderson Valley  - about an hour's drive from the cabin - and touring the brewery there.

The Cabrillo Lighthouse and Headlands less than a mile from the house.  Ft. Bragg Botanical Gardens. The Water Tower restaurant in Mendo Village, much better than the more famous Cafe B.

The walk from the property to the lighthouse is perfect for all ages with great views of the ocean!

Gourmet local grocer is well stocked, but pricey. The Botanical Gardens in Fort Bragg are amazing, but confusing to navigate so don't go late in the day. The Glass Beach is closed sadly, for now. Don't miss the Cabrillo Lighthouse, but keep small children away from the clift..the most beautiful Fresnel prism lens I've ever seen, and a fun gift shop. Their marine exhibit is very educational for children and adults. Clint's Seafood restaurant in Fort Bragg is excellent and great views of boats coming in.

Patterson's Pub in town had great food/drinks and is terrific for watching Giants games!

Mendocino Cliffs that's a few minutes drive from the property was awesome!  As well as the Point Cabrillo Lighthouse.

We come to stay every October for the Abalone Festival put on by MAPA in Noyo Harbor.  Fabulous food (buy cookoff judging tickets in advance), fabulous weather and a relaxing long weekend.

Dinner and drinks at Silver's in Ft Bragg was special.  Great food, great view.

loved the trail that was right in the backyard of the house, we rode our bikes all the way to the ocean!

Mendocino Cafe has wonderful food and the gardens there are really beautiful.  Walking the headlands is always on our list of things to do in Mendocino.  The botanical gardens just south of Fort Bragg are definitely worth the trip.

The Mayan Infusion on the Wharf has great food.  We had not been there before.  Mendocino Magic was very clean, had everything we needed and was quiet with an early rising 5 year old.  The garden was magical for grandma and granddaughter exploring.  Our Daughter lives in Casper so location was ideal.  We would love to stay there again.

Very close to mountain biking trails.  Very quiet and peaceful property.

Botanical Gardens was a wonderful day....allow for plenty of time to stroll, picnic and enjoy!

Also, Big River beach was amazing with such a dramatic mix of river/ocean sights and sounds! Beautiful!

I've been going to Mendocino for 52 years.  We have a family cabin in mendocino.   We were celebrating my mom's life so there wasn't enough room for all at the cabin.  There are so many wonderful places in the area.  Some of my favorites are Frankie's Ice Cream Parlor in Mendo, the restaurant by the water tower on lansing st is delicious, 10 mile beach 20 miles or so north? is beautiful and sunny often times when mendo isn't.  Just plain beautiful and the house did not disappoint.  Thank you.

Walks and runs in the area of Russian Gulch State Park and Cabrillo Light House.

The town was picturesque, fog was a sight to see, local grocer was a great resource and decent pricing, nearby beaches were excellent and the state park across the street was great. Overall awesome location!

We are regular visitors to the area several times a year.

Glass beach, The Mendocino Hotel, the beach in general, all of it was beautiful.

Franklin and Laurel streets in Ft. Bragg now have fun shops and art that hearkens back to the old days of Mendocino.  Walks on the headlands, and food at Wild Fish (Albion).....and pottery frogs by Alexis Moyer at the gallery in Ft. Bragg!  Salmon or fresh caught fish at the fish market on the dock in Noyo!.....photos by Jon Klein at the Photography Gallery in Ft. Bragg. These are a few of my favorite things!!!

We enjoyed several walks down to the beach. Strolling around town is always great; Main Street had several nice shops to visit.

Mendo Bistro is a great place to eat. Ravens is another wonderful place to dine.

Good Life cafe was a good spot in town and Frankie's for pizza.

The fern trail at Van Damme Park is not to be missed.  It is a multi-use trail - short for biking but definitely worth it.  The bike trail along the coast from Ft Bragg northward is astonishingly beautiful.

Glass Beach and Point Cabrillo Lighthouse.  Both were wonderful

Sallie Mac and Panache are lovely stores run by awesome people!

Trilium Cafe, Fancy That, Sally Mac, Flow cafe upstairs, music festival!  Also went to Dolphin Isle in Ft. Bragg for Saturday afternoon music - very fun.

MacKerricher State Park is wonderful and a short drive away.

Walking out on the headlands at Mendocino, hot tubbing from the Pallete House porch with a stellar view of the ocean, having a cozy family dinner next to all the windows looking at the ocean...

Catch a canoe .. Rent a outrigger and head up the Big River , beautiful place.

Big River is the best beach, for everyone.

Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens and Ecological Staircase walk to Pygmy forest at Jug Handle State Reserve

A note about house: the garage floor was painted the day or day before we arrived. VERY strong paint odor whole time we were there in kitchen & bedroom next to kitchen. This was our only negative. Also when we arrived garage door open. When we left cover had blown off car in driveway.

The visitors center in Mendocino was very helpful regarding plans for our trip.

They had wonderful hike recommendations.  The man and woman who run it are wonderful and knowledgable!

It's a lovely location right on the edge of Mendocino, so many of the restaurants and shops are within walking distance.

Silver's, Carine's Italian Fish Grotto and Captain Flints at NOYO HARBOR.

All three restaurants had amazing food.

We spent a wonderful morning of pampering at the Beauty Bar in Fort Bragg.

Casper Beach and Jughandle were beautiful.  The Point Cabrillo lighthouse was very cool.  If  someone is interested in art and galleries, we would HIGHLY recommend going to the Glass Fire gallery.  Some of the blown glass pieces there  were as beautiful as Murano glass in Venice, Italy and the owners are very nice.  The Mendocino cafe was also very nice and has a beautiful flower garden in front of the outdoor seating.  We also love that almost everywhere you go in Mendocino is pet friendly!!

Casper Beach and Jughandle were beautiful.  The Point Cabrillo lighthouse was very cool.  If  someone is interested in art and galleries, we would HIGHLY recommend going to the Glass Fire gallery.

Mendocino Cafe has the most wonderful food and wine, and a dog-friendly deck!

While you may not run into the mysterious Strider at this cozy Mendocino vacation rental, when you stay at The Prancing Pony (the name is a Lord of the Rings reference), you'll be surrounded by an enchanting Northern California forest - 20 secluded, forested acres to be precise. From the raised deck to the inviting bedrooms, this wooded cottage will fulfill your vacation fantasy.

Just three miles away is the village of Mendocino (and the ocean) where you can grab a pint at Patterson's Pub or pick up a freshly made deli sandwich at Mendocino Market. Take your snack to refuel during a hike through Mendocino Headlands State Park, just northwest of the village and less than four miles from the home.

Have up to four more people who want to join your fellowship? Rent Bag End, the main house on this property, along with this cottage. Both homes are magnificently decorated, cozy, and surrounded by beauty.

With room for four (three adults max), chances are that you'll spend a lot of your personal time off relaxing at this Mendocino getaway. If you're driving up from the Bay Area, pick up a bottle of pinot noir from a Sonoma Coast winery to enjoy on this home's sprawling deck. The lush trees and ferns hugging the property will allow you to live in the moment.

Inside is a colorful family room where you can truly unwind and unplug. With no TV or WiFi, you'll let go of the everyday and enjoy the company of your family and friends. Get lost in a novel from the home's library and, on chilly nights, heat up the pellet stove and play a board game from the home's collection around the four-seat dining table.

The fully stocked kitchen will inspire you to stay in and cook favorites for every meal (even elevensies). Bring your coarsely ground Blue Bottle roast to make a fine cup of coffee with the provided French press. You can enjoy it under the morning sunshine out on the deck.

After a day of beachcombing, you'll want to curl up in a comfy bed. On the main floor you'll find one of the bedrooms (with a queen-size bed) and the bathroom with a walk-in shower. Through this master bedroom is access to the loft upstairs, which holds another queen.

Pack lightly, because there's also a private washer and dryer in this home.

If you're coming from the Bay Area, why not take a leisurely drive up Highway 1 to visit the charming seaside stops of Bodega Bay, Gualala, Elk, and Albion along the way? Fill up on their local fare and stretch your legs on their pleasant beaches during your mini road trip.

Once here, 12 miles north of Mendocino is its biggest town, Fort Bragg, for shopping dining, and a funky laid back vibe.

Closer to home, search for a whole sand dollar on Big River Beach, a 7,400 acre wildlife corridor in the Mendocino Headlands State Park. For an afternoon paddling on Big River itself, rent a kayak. Still, there's nothing like holding hands with your honey while watching the Pacific crash onto and carve out the rocky coast.

Your time off is precious, so spend it in a place that allows you to get away from it all. This Northern California Coast vacation rental will definitely inspire!

A unique cottage away from the everyday!

Don't miss an opportunity for both adventure and relaxation. This Mendocino vacation rental is truly unique, from the tree house to the decor. With more character than an epic novel, this cottage (or hobbit-hole, really) sits on 20 acres of private forested land. Unplug, unwind, and embrace life to the fullest here!

While Bag End is only three miles from the village of Mendocino, trail-filled headlands, and wildlife-teeming beaches, the property itself is super secluded. A short drive on a bucolic road eventually leads you to Patterson's Pub for a pint, Mendocino Market for a sandwich, or any of the other quaint eateries and shops in the village.

If you've spent hours in a book imaging what it would be like to live in The Shire, a stay at this northern California coast cabin might get you part way there. The immediate grounds of the house are meant to be enjoyed. Let the kids play in the tree house or romp around the wooded plot while you and your old pals catch up on the rustic bench circle.

This home, which accommodates four, can be rented along with The Prancing Pony, a neighboring house sleeping three adults and one child. Two groups of traveling friends or two families will be quite lucky to experience these literary-loving locations together.

A spacious deck with gas grill will make it easy to fix a meal for two or eight if you're renting both homes. Just inside the furnished deck is the vibrant grand room.

Unlike the everyday living room that is anchored by a television, this space, as is the rest of the house, is digital free. No WiFi as well.

Have a real vacation away from the norm by unplugging and smelling the roses, so to speak. Light up the wood-burning stove fireplace, rock in a chair with your child on your lap, or gaze through the telescope at your favorite constellation. Play a board game all night long. If you connect with the outside world at all, it might as well be to share pictures of the remarkable decor in this home.

The kitchen is fully stocked and stunning simply to look at. Have your morning coffee (this well-stocked space even offers a bean grinder) on the wind chime-adorned porch as the fog drifts through or take an afternoon snooze on the hammock. Admire the rainbow of wood staining on the cabinetry, a motif that continues into the half bathroom.

In the full bathroom, soak away your cares in the deep tub. A step up from hardwood flooring to the bathtub and stand-alone shower make this room feel substantial and grand. From your bubble bath, you can look out of the huge windows at serene pine tress. This is not your typical bathroom.

A max of four adults will feel quite taken care of here among the two bedrooms, each with a king-size bed. The master even has a writing desk and armchair for reading. For added atmosphere, the bedrooms and bathroom are accessible via a wooden spiral staircase.

There's also a private washer and dryer, so while you'll feel like you're in a faraway place, you'll still have this modern amenity.

If you can get yourself away from this escape, there is so much beauty all within a few miles. In addition to Mendocino's village, Fort Bragg is a laid-back town just a short drive north, and hamlets like Elk, Albion, and Gualala are jaunt to the south. Bodega Bay is about halfway between Mendocino and the San Francisco Bay Area, so if you're coming up from there, it's worth a stop.

Mendocino Headlands State Park is a mere four mile drive away and boasts trails overlooking Big River Beach, a 7,400 acre wildlife corridor. Kayak on Big River itself by renting watercraft from a friendly local business. And, even more small seaside towns along Highway 1 (like Fort Bragg and Bodega Bay) can be visited en route or on the journey home.

Make the most of your precious time off and share in an experience like no other! Gather your loved ones for this Northern California Coast vacation rental soon.

Let a laid-back, comfortable vibe take over when you spend a few days in this lovely Mendocino vacation rental! With a private hot tub and room for up to 12 to relax or play between beach sessions, this four bedroom home is fantastic for a family getaway or a group of friends to enjoy!

Just three hours north of San Francisco, this Mendocino county getaway offers something for everyone. The restaurants, breweries, galleries, and shop-filled sections of downtown Mendocino and neighboring Fort Bragg are only about a 15-minutes drive away from this charming home. There's also Point Cabrillo Lighthouse and access to hiking, biking and the beach right nearby - it's a great base for those who want the full seaside experience.

With a welcoming farmhouse-style exterior and freshly-decorated interior complete with a hot tub that had an ocean view, this wonderful Arabesque vacation retreat will quickly make anyone feel right at home. The front deck will beckon as the sun begins to sink into the horizon, and anytime of day, the oceanfront views are always sure to please.

The brightly painted gas fireplace will catch your eye as soon as you walk through the door, and with two nap-worthy couches facing a large television it's tempting to doze-off after a long day at the beach!

You'll have a full kitchen here that is gourmet-inspired and spacious, with a granite center island, all the appliances you'll need for meal preparation, and enough plates, glasses, and silverware for a feast. Enjoy mimosas over brunch in the morning or a make-your-own taco party in the evening.

At night, escape to the brightly-painted master bedroom retreat with a king-size bed,  where a couple could spread out and get a good night's sleep or snuggle into for a mid-afternoon nap! Attached is an updated bathroom with two sinks and a jetted tub, right past the gas fireplace.

The other two bedrooms have queen-size beds, and one has a glass door that leads to the deck where a large and inviting hot tub awaits. There's also a sitting area upstairs where anyone could get away and catch up on their favorite reading.  In addition, you'll have two futons and a sofabed - up to 12 guests can comfortably stay here.

The garage has been converted into a game room where there is Ping-Pong and a pool table for everyone to gather around! There's also a dart board, croquet, and other games to keep the kids entertained, while the adults socialize.

Do a wine tasting at the Pacific Star Winery just 15 minutes away, visit the fun coastal towns of Mendocino or Fort Bragg for some fantastic local shopping or a meal out, or simply relax and settle into the breathtaking beauty of the coast. And don't worry about keeping your clothes clean - you'll even have a washer and dryer back at your vacation home!

Hiking, biking, fishing, or an easy bonfire on the beach are just a few blocks away, and there's always the Mendocino Botanical Gardens for the nature lover in you, it's located just 15 minutes north!

There's something for everyone to take advantage of in this comfortable and warm Northern California Coast vacation rental.  This area offers many popular attractions and activities, plan a stay and see for yourself!

Perfect for a family get together, kids included. Room for volley ball and badminton.  Very nice house, kitchen is fantastic.

Very clean with a lot to do. We really enjoyed playing pool and ping pong. The location was perfect for hiking and having the dog with us was really nice. Would definitely stay here again.

The villages, vineyards, and stunning natural beauty of the Mendocino Coast - or just "the Coast," as locals prefer - make this oceanfront slice of California an unforgettable destination for a laid-back adventure. Mendocino vacation rentals offer you a comfortable and cozy homebase for exploring one of the most remarkable locations on the West Coast.

Three hours north of San Francisco (and just shy of five hours from the Oregon border), you'll find a secluded, arts-minded paradise nestled between old-growth redwood forests and the churning waves of the Pacific Ocean... and there's no better way to experience this region than by living like a local in one of our Mendocino vacation rentals.

The village of Mendocino itself, once a logging boomtown, is now a little quieter and laid-back, with around 1,000 full-time residents. Thanks to the visiting tourists who arrive from the Bay Area on summer weekends, however, you'll find some truly wonderful restaurants, shops, and galleries to keep you entertained throughout your stay. Stop by Patterson's Pub for a pint of local beer and a bowl of clam chowder, or stock up on picnic supplies at Mendocino Market and head for the beach.

The entire coastline around the village is comprised of Mendocino Headlands State Park - the perfect spot for picnics, as well as hiking, beach combing, or simply soaking up the views of the rugged coastline and crashing waves. To get a little closer to the scenic wilderness, pay a visit to the knowledgable folks at Catch a Canoe & Bicycles Too to rent kayak, canoe, or bike for the day. The Big River, which empties into Mendocino Bay just south of town, is ideal for an afternoon of paddling - and Catch a Canoe even specializes in dog-friendly canoes so you can bring your four-legged best friend along for the ride!

The region surrounding Mendocino is full of fodder for excellent day trips. Head south to tiny Elk, California for breakfast the legendary Queenie's Roadhouse Cafe, or stop in Albion for a romantic oceanfront dinner at the Ledford House. Head out for a hike along the gorgeous, redwood-lined Navarro River. Or, drive north along Highway 1, stopping by the beautiful Point Cabrillo lighthouse on the way to funky Fort Bragg.

However you choose to spend your time in Mendocino, it's guaranteed to deliver that unmistakable Northern California sense of laid-back beauty. And Vacasa has the perfect Mendocino lodging in store, from dog-friendly beach houses to luxury country estates. Book one of our Mendocino vacation rentals today, and get your adventure started!

Surrounded by redwoods with a private garden & near coast!

Nestled among towering trees on 10 acres of seaside land, this newly renovated Mendocino vacation rental offers a serene setting for families and friends exploring quiet spots along the Northern California Coast. Snack on fresh strawberries from the garden, play on the tire swing, and warm up by the wood-burning fireplace.

While you'll experience quiet privacy in this cozy home, coastal attractions are not far. About two miles west is the coast and the heart of Mendocino. On the south side of Big River, visit The Standford Inn to share afternoon tea or a healthy vegan lunch. Cross the river's mouth to the north and stroll the quaint village. Get spirited away by the fog drifting from your perch in Mendocino Headlands State Park (three-and-a-half miles away).

Back at your getaway, all eight guests will their own little piece of paradise. Children or sweethearts can steal away on the wooded property to dream on the tire swing surrounded by soft ferns and redwoods. Read a book from the home’s library on the raised deck.

Inside, gather around the huge flatscreen TV with cable and warm up on cool coastal nights with provided logs popping and crackling in the wood-burning stove. The modified A-frame with abundant windows (including a skylight) can truly be appreciated in the great room.

On the other side of the spacious room is the gourmet kitchen with a double oven and six-burner gas stove top. Wake up the house with the aroma of freshly ground coffee with the provided grinder. Serve a local cheese and fruit platter on the kitchen island (with a convenient outlet) butcher block while chatting over Sonoma Coast wines. In nice weather, take your nibbles outside to the picnic table in the enclosed garden.

Of the four bedrooms here, three are located on the lower level (along with one of the full bathrooms). Two have full beds and another has a twin bed. Upstairs, you'll find a spacious master loft with a king-size bed and updated bathroom featuring a walk-in shower and deep soaking tub below a picturesque sylvan view. There is also a smaller bedroom upstairs with a twin bed.

Additional amenities include WiFi and a private washer and dryer.

If you're looking for more seaside attractions or staying here as a part of a Highway 1 road trip, visit Fort Bragg just 12 miles north. The Mendocino Botanical Gardens are on the way and would be a lovely family photo op. Hike at MacKerricher State Park and search for sea caves and tide pools.

This cozy, three-bedroom Mendocino vacation rental is filled with country-style charm, from its rustic exposed-wood interior with wood stove, to its nicely updated kitchen. And with a great location about a mile east of Mendocino Headlands State Park and the surrounding downtown area, you can drive, bike, or even walk to shops, restaurants, galleries, or even the beach.

Inside the living room you'll be all set to enjoy a relaxing night in. Pick a spot on one of the plush sofas, settle back against a floral pillow, and throw a log in the wood stove - or if you prefer, take the window seat and stay warm and cozy beside the fire. There's a flat screen TV with cable and a DVD player for entertainment options, as well as WiFi so you can stay connected.

The full kitchen is centrally located right near the dining room and living rooms, so you can socialize or carry on conversations while sitting in front of the fire or while getting dinner ready. There's an island cooktop, refrigerator, oven, and dishwasher at this charming Fairy Ring Cottage. And when it's time to eat, gather everyone around the wooden table on the edge of the kitchen. On sunny summer evenings, eat dinner out on the deck and admire the tree-lined view. There's even an outdoor grill if you have a craving for some barbecued chicken thighs.

This Mendocino vacation getaway boasts design touches like stained glass windows, wood paneling, and skylights for a cabin-in-the-redwoods aesthetic. On the lower level, there are two of the home's three bedrooms. One has a double bed, and the other two twins - both will make guests feel right at home.

Upstairs, the master suite takes up the whole loft area. The lucky occupant of this relaxing space will have a queen bed, a private bathroom complete with a copper tub, and a private deck. This Northern California beach cottage will sleep up to six guests quite comfortably. And don't forget your pets! Dogs are welcome here with a $10 per day, per pet fee ($40 minimum per stay).

Additional amenities include a stereo, board games, and a washer and dryer. But perhaps one of the best advantage of a stay here, is the great location just over a mile east of the charming village center of Mendocino. In less than five minutes you can be exploring the town - having a red tail ale and some snacks at the Mendocino Brewing Company or looking for some new reading material at the Mendocino Book Company. Even more shops, galleries, gardens, and restaurants dot the streets of this picturesque community, so you'll definitely be able to find something to do here in town.

Don't feel like shopping? The rocky, rugged coastline surrounds downtown Mendocino on three sides. Take the steps down to the beach and watch the waves roll in or stay up on the bluff and hike along the headlands. Whichever you choose, be sure to bring your camera!

Easy day trips include the Point Cabrillo Lighthouse and bustling Fort Bragg to the north and Van Damme State Park and the small town of Little River to the south. And don't forget, Mendocino County is home to a number of wineries and an epicenter of California's organic "green" wine production. So, head inland and make a day of it, stopping at wineries and vineyards to sample the region's best offerings.

Mendocino is an ideal location for an unforgettable Northern California Coast vacation rental! Unwind at this cute as a button Fairy Ring Cottage right near the ocean and the redwoods for a getaway your whole group will never forget!

We felt very comfortable here in the Fairy Ring Cottage.  Its spacious, open floor plan and very conveniently located.  Our destinations were Elk, Mendocino and Fort Bragg.  Easy access to all places.

The house is very nice and clean.  We had an awesome stay and will be staying here again in the future.

Beautiful cabin although the trees in the year are all furs not redwoods but all in all perfect spot to get away with the kids... Wine glasses and coffee pot and washer dryer got it five stars in my book.

We really enjoyed our stay.  The house is extremely quiet and private, which is what we wanted.  It is nestled in the redwood forest and the only neighbor we saw was a small buck.

For anyone who wants an immaculate place, please stay in a hotel.  This is an older home and we were thrilled to find a place so close to my aging mother where we could have the flexibility of eating at home or going out.

We love this property which is why we keep coming back.  The quiet and surrounding forest are great.  The woodsy, rustic charm of the house are great.  The decks are great.  The location is great.

We had a great time! we love the stain glass and the skylights.  Our two small dogs had the best time they didn't want to leave:)   The home is very quite and peaceful.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.

If you are okay with a mile walk into town, this is a great little cottage.  Very private, well appointed (don't expect high end cooking equipment, but most everything you need is there) and cozy.  Bring a flashlight to get in if you arrive after dark (it helps).  Most things are self-explanatory, all appliances work and pretty easy to start a fire in the wood stove.  Parking in Mendo is usually pretty easy if you are not into walking.  Best value is Trillium for farm to fork.  Best beers and clam chowder Patterson's (no cash).  The Mendocino Film Festival in late May is a good time to be there.

When we walked in thr the house it had a bad smell. My other complaint about this house was the kitchen.  We cooked all our meals here and there was a shortage of pans.  The rest of the house was great.  The beds were comfortable.  We loved the rustic feel and the woods surrounding house.  We would definitely come back.

We recently stayed at the Fairy Ring Cottage in Mendocino, 2 adults and 2 small children.  The cottage is tucked back among towering trees and has many skylights to let a little extra light into the living areas.  The outside deck is perfect for observing nature and keeping an eye on curious kids.  The fairy ring itself was a source of much wonder to the little ones.  Being just off the road, access to downtown activities such as shopping and dining makes it very convenient, too.  Vacasa was very responsive when making reservations (which were only a week ahead of time) and stayed in touch with information about the cottage (welcome guide) and easy directions for finding it and getting in the door.  My grandson wants to buy it!

I loved this rental because of the room it had if you have a family and it is within walking distance to Mendocino!

The cottage was all it said it was, cozy, clean and well situated....although more than a 10 minute walk to the town.

The only slightly negative comments are: 1. The heating in the first bedroom did not work. 2. One blind in the second bedroom did not retract. The beds in the first bedroom were very "spongy" and soft.

Otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recomend it

Enjoyed our stay over Thanksgiving week.  The Fairy Ring Cottage was cozy and comfortable in good weather and in the rain, which made housing family for a special occasion much easier.  We chose this house specifically because it was pet friendly.  The location of the house is excellent and the skylights, stained glass, and open floor plan with large kitchen were other highlights.  Also enjoyed the views of giant redwoods and the secluded feeling of the forest.

Overall, we really enjoyed our retreat! We had four kids with us, and we loved the solitude and relaxation. The fireplace was perfect, and it was a bonus to have cable and WiFi. We hooked up our Apple TV and watched movies together. The BBQ was perfect, and we enjoyed home-cooked meals every day. The local sites are all very close, so we made a few trips into town and along the beaches between meals.

If you plan on making your own meals (as we did), then I'd plan on bringing some extra pots and pans. There aren't a lot to choose from, and the ones that are there are not in good repair. Nonetheless, once we got settled in, we adjusted to the surroundings and made ourselves right at home.

We loved this retreat, and enjoyed the peace and quiet. It was a great escape.

The upstairs loft was SO AMAZING! It is where I would want to spend a honeymoon! The copper tub was such an added surprise! The open concept kitchen was perfect for meal times as well. Loved every part of it! Thank you so much!

we really enjoyed our stay , close to great parks... hiking, swimming...

grocery just down the road for convenience and what a cute little town.. we wish we had arrived earlier on friday for the farmers market (10-2pm)

hanging out on both the lower and upper deck was great, listening to the birds...the wind.. and loving to stare at the beautiful redwoods...

we also think we may have heard a fairy in the woods, or some kind of tiny bells anyway!

i recommend this for a family of four it was perfect, but could have fit 2 more! :)

Become inspired by the sea views from the deck

This three-bedroom Mendocino vacation rental, called Chanticleer, is a beautiful artist's retreat. There are two wrap-around decks overlooking the ocean, a vintage cone fireplace, original artwork adorning the walls, and a garden and private viewing deck nestled amongst the wooded glades.

Chanticleer is a five-minute drive to hiking and picnicking along 45 redwood-coved acres at Admiral Standley State Park Recreation Area, wine tasting at Elke Vineyards, and viewing zebras, antelope, and more at B. Ryan Animal Preserve.

The stunning asymmetrical exterior of the home is surrounded by ferns and natural vegetation. Chanticleer has three levels and two separate wrap-around decks providing magnificent views over a wooded glade to a whitewater view of the Pacific Ocean. The upper level offers a bathroom, two guest rooms with queen-sized beds, and an extra sleeping space with a twin-sized bed. Each room is cozy and inviting with vintage wood paneling, and eccentric collections of artwork, seashells and decor.

The middle level of the home offers floor to ceiling windows in the posh, open-concept living room. Dive into your favorite crossword on the leather loveseat or sit down to a cup of coffee in one of two leather armchairs. An ornate red and blue rug and modern floor lamps tie the room together, while Redwood paneling makes the space feel rustic and charmingly vintage.

A cone fireplace reminiscent of the 1970s and a rack of wood punctuate the living room, inviting guests to curl up with a blanket by the fire. A wrap-around deck just off the living room offers patio chairs, and a charcoal grill, making it the perfect spot for burgers and brews while taking in the fresh sea air. When you aren't taking in the views, watch satellite TV, or pop in a DVD or VHS movie at the media center. Just off the living room is a small den with built-in bookshelves, a CD and cassette player, half bath, and an extra sleeping space with a twin-sized bed.

The dining room is adjacent to the living room. A farm-style dining table and built in bench for six will allow you and your guests to break bread together. Quaint muffin tins and original artwork adorn the dining room shelves, and the fully-stocked kitchen offers a dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, stove, and toaster.

Downstairs is the master suite complete with a private bathroom, queen-sized bed, and private  sitting room with a built-in desk, TV and sofa. The master suite also has a romantic private deck for midnight toasts of champagne and star gazing.

The 2,100-square-foot home is on one acre, and has room for eight guests. The outside deck leads to manicured gardens and a viewing deck up a walkway from the house, making it a favorite spot to enjoy the sunsets and watch the woodpeckers. The washer and dryer makes extended stays a breeze, and wireless Internet means you can stay alert and plugged in! And don't forget to bring your furry friends! The pet fee is $10 daily per pet, with a $40 minimum per stay.

For a day trip, drive five minutes to Mendocino and visit the Sea Glass Museum, featuring hand-crafted jewelry made from local beach glass. Order a plate of comfort food at Lumberjack's Restaurant, or take the self-guided discovery trail through untouched redwood groves at Hendy Woods State Park.

No matter how you spend your visit, this Mendocino vacation home is the perfect artist's retreat to slow down and get inspired by the beauty of nature, with all the comforts of home.

We had a great time! In fact, we wish we could have stayed longer. The property was private, quiet, and had an amazing view. The house was clean and had everything we needed.  We can't wait to find the time to come back for another stay.

Beautiful setting, home could use some maintenance, but overall very satisfied...very comfortable and centrally located between Mendocino and Fort Bragg.

This property could be very nice. Appliances need updating. Kitchen utensils need replacing. Living room view would be nice but for the film applied to the windows causing a very distorted view.  Looked as though it was furnished from the goodwill store.

Had a wonderful time the house is centrally located so the state parks  weren't far .Beautiful  views of the ocean as well as the property ,can't wait to go again.

Great home to relax, have a BBQ, sit back and watch the fog roll in and out from.  Great location and centrally located to the cities of Mendocino and Fort Bragg.

It was best vacation I ever had in long time.

The lighting in the pictures is deceiving. Aside from the updated lower level area and the living room, this house is dark and uninviting. You are greeted with a musty smell that you end up taking home with you. Brick and wood floors, wood paneling everywhere, no good place for families to sit together...this home is not comfortable whatsoever. Be prepared to hear everything that is going on in any room of the house. Not sure who stayed before us, but with the amount of dog hair that lined every part of the house (including our "clean" bedding) I'd guess a dog lived there for quite some time. The furniture is in need of replacement. The decor is extremely dated. The view from the deck was beautiful, and the location was quiet. BBQing outside was nice, but there is no table to eat outside. Would be a lovely place to stay at again if some of these issues (especially the cleanliness) were addressed.

Comfortable for couples vacationing together or family stay. Very close to town of Mendocino, within bike riding distance.  Nice forest setting around house and hot tub.

The Redwood Rest cabin in the Redwoods was a lovely, spacious, clean cabin.  It was secluded yet near the main road to get to the vacation adventures we wanted.  We searched the internet for days trying to decide where to stay and were very happy with our choice and would go back again.

Quiet, peaceful, serene. The house is perfectly located; just over a mile into Mendocino.

Hot tub perfect for two and fine for four.

Kitchen fully equipped.

The house was spotless

Loved everything about this place!

You feel like its buried deep in the forest, (it is actually) but only about a mile from town. Highly recommended.

Enjoyed the comfort and peacefulness of this home and location.    Easy drive to Mendocino, beaches and fort Bragg.

Redwood rest was wonderful. The location was great secluded enough for privacy but not isolated. The property was beautiful. The hot tub was a delight! Just a heads up for future guests the property's house number is not very clear, obscured by a tree.

Lovely property, on a good sized lot surrounded by woods, with a very private and secluded feeling.   The house was clean and in good shape.  It was a great base camp for our trips into the county.  We were very pleased.

Pretty cedar house in a forest clearing.  Perfectly quiet.  House is attractive inside and out.  Furnishings are adequate.

Private and secluded property was perfect for our visit-lack of a view may not be for everyone.

We would stay again if furnishings were updated.

Your house in in the perfect spot for folks who want to spend time in Mendocino and on the headlands and river.   It is delightfully quiet, and seems very remote, though it is in among other homes. The home is simple and cozy, with vacation furnishings you can feel OK sitting on!  Snooty factor is low, thank you.    If you like the quiet and green of the redwood forest, you will like the stay at this home.  Great price.

Mendocino is one of my favorite places, and we enjoy all of it, but staying at Redwood Rest made our short get-away even better. It's nestled in the Redwoods, with trees ALL around, making you feel you're miles away from everywhere and anyone, but town is very close. It was comfortable and perfect for our time with our 11 year old granddaughter.  Thank you!

A vacation rental that was very clean and in good repair. Nicely equipped and very private. While no view of the ocean it was very convenient to the village. I would recommend very highly.

Treat yourself to this custom-built contemporary three bedroom Mendocino vacation rental! It can be your home away from home, while you enjoy the sunset relaxing on deck overlooking the ocean.

Located less than five miles to Russian Gulch State Park, you can enjoy tanning on the beach or swimming in the water. You can also take a hike and see a 36-foot high waterfall. Devil's Punch Bowl is a must see for all adventure seekers - a large collapsed sea cave with churning water. This is the perfect location if you are looking for a quiet vacation or looking for beach access, hiking trails and biking. Pt. Cabrillo Lighthouse and Caspar Beach are also located close by.

With the island in the kitchen there is counter space for the aspiring chef of the family! Whip up a gourmet meal while enjoying the rustic wood cabinets. Indulge in your meal at the dining room table, which seats up to 6 or on the beautiful oceanview deck.

Curl up to the warm fireplace and relax over the memories you have created so far and plan what is to come. Or flip on the TV and catch up on the latest shows!

There is space for everyone, as in the master bedroom there is a spacious king-sized bed for the relaxation you desperately need. The second bedroom has a queen-sized bed, while the third bedroom has a twin-sized bed with a welcoming decor for the children. Except for the bathrooms, every room in this home has an oceanview! And every bedroom, its own private deck.

After a long day at the beach, make sure to rejuvenate in the outdoor private hot tub! And don't worry about the dirty beach clothes, as there is a washer and dryer in the downstairs bathroom for your convenience. If you need to catch up with friends back home or have deadlines to meet, you have no excuses - besides the fact you're on vacation - as there is WiFi throughout the house.

With its magnificent ocean views, stained glass and tasteful furnishings there is something for everyone at this beautiful Northern California Coast vacation rental!

Well located 3 bd 2 bath with super ocean view -- about 1/2 mile from bluffs.  Nice fit for a 'two couples, two kids ' combo.  Upstairs has unique foyer with toaster oven and coffee maker -- so possible for an early rising couple to graze and not wake up the whole house. Hot tub worked perfectly and also has ocean view.

Such a relaxing way to go.  Not the hustle and bustle of a motel room.  No one wanted to leave.

Whale Song is a wonderful house and has everything in it. The views from the back terrace are magnificent. It's quite a unforgettable experience to soak in the hot tub and watch the restless winter Pacific. We also had deers coming to our front door in one morning which made the kids ecstatic. I hope we'll return soon again.

The house was very comfortable.  It is a great place to relax and enjoy both ocean and woodland views.  The house is very private.

The house was very cozy for a short weekend getaway with a newborn. Great views and the surrounding neighborhood feels very private and secluded.  Housekeeping could do a better job at cleaning the house though, especially the showers in both bathrooms.

THis is a well stocked, convenient and lovely spot to spend with your family.   Easy access to parks, beaches, vineyards and quaint towns.  Peaceful, relaxing and comfortable.

This house has an amazing Ocean View from every single room in the house.  We were able to get some great pictures of family from off the deck looking out over the ocean.  There is plexy glass all along the deck which helps if you have any young ones since this house does sit up on a hill. It is a very cozy home with all the amenities one would need.  Even a little kitchenette for guests upstairs.  Hot tub was great as well and very clean and maintained. My only issue with this home was that I think housekeeping could have done a better job and there were a few maintenance issues, which I have informed Vacasa about and I would assume they are going to take care of.

The minute our 11 year old saw the Whale bedroom she asked, "Can we come here every year?" The view from the hot tub was great and getting fresh salmon and rock cod right off the boat in Noyo Harbor is something that is a definite must. Close to the Mendocino Brewing company - get one of the beer tastings to share- and MacKerricher State Park. Loved seeing the baby deer from the balcony and watching the heron observe us in the hot tub from his regular perch. The local flock of wild turkeys are also not to be missed. We love Mendocino area and this was a perfect getaway.

We had a great time staying at Whale Song.  The location is very convenient --within walking distance to Russian Gulch Park and a short drive to Mendocino downtown and Fort Bragg.  A lot of thought has been put into the decorations around the house.  Our daughter loved the stuffed animal whales in the upstairs bedroom.  The staff members we talked to through emails or phone were very polite and quick to answer our questions, even on weekends and late evenings. Overall we were very happy with the experience and would definitely come back again.

Whale Song is a wonderful place to relax and kick back.  We enjoyed the view and the proximity to Mendo and Ft. Bragg.  We will be back!

Beach house was awesome.  There are great views of the ocean and the lighthouse, especially from upstairs.  We were very comfortable and wished we didn't have to leave. We will definitely be back!!

view was great,could have been better..Upstairs balcony facing away from ocean..Looks towards neighbors house

Great long weekend in the Mendocino area. Home was very centrally located between Fort Bragg and Mendocino. Quiet neighborhood with lots of deers wandering around and nice ocean views. Kids (2&5 yrs old) had a blast running around the spacious yard. Small beach at bottom of hill (.25 miles) w/ convenient store. House had everything we needed, and we would happily recommend it to a friend.

Looking forward to another adventure through Vacasa. Thank-you to the home owners for the expierence to relax in there beautiful home.

First off, we rent vacation homes a couple three times a year, and this is the first time ever we have had one share the garage - what a priceless touch.  A great home we slept well and the last day we saw whales off the lower deck.

Thanks!

The view of the ocean from the driveway was perfect, however, from the house it was disappointing.  The property is perfect for a stay, but the goal of this visit was to view the ocean with a glass of wine and take in the beauty.  Had to walk away from the house to do that.

this was really fantastic place, we really like it a lot. It was very clean with beach feel to it. Fully furnished with a lot of kitchen tools. I cannot be happier!

It has really nice deck, I wish there would be outdoor grill and perhaps a hot tub.

We had a wonderful stay at the beach house near Caspar beach. It is a great location for walking over and enjoying the ocean at the nearby beaches. The house itself is very spacious, well-furnished. We enjoyed this ideal beach house and highly recommend to others.

We spent 5 lovely days at this well appointed beach house and will forever treasure the memories we created here.  It was perfect for my husband and I, our 12 YO son and his friend, and our dog.  The house is so comfortable and cozy and we truly loved it here.  I shed a few tears as we pulled out of the drive-way.  Even our dog was sad to leave ... I literally had to drag him out of the house.  We will definitely be returning for more happy times. The Whelon Family, San Francisco.

My mom and I stayed in the beach house for three nights in April. We were wowed by the size of the house. The photos do not do it justice. There are two big living areas, one on each floor, plus a little nook on the second floor where we spent most of our time because it had the best view and comfy chairs. The bedrooms are on diagonally opposite sides of the house so no one disturbs anyone else. The area is very quiet. We saw many deers in the neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again if we visit Mendocino.

Good location, walking distance to a pretty beach and wonderful viewing of the sea lion colony and the coast from the nearby headlands.  Lots of natural light, quiet and comfortable.  Warm and sunny, deer walking past the desk, close to Fort Bragg, good central location for all the surrounding activities.

A lovely home, perfectly situated between Mendocino and Fort Bragg. It had all the conveniences of home, plus a lovely view. We hope to visit again in fall. Thank you!

We used to vacation for many years in the 1970 and 1980, and stayed in the campground at Casper Beach Rv park.  We celebrated my husband's 80th birthday at the Beach House with our friends of over 50 years that we used to vacation with at Casper Rv park.  We enjoyed remembering all the fun we had over the years with our children.  But the Beach House was just perfect for us.  The layout is great for 2 couples, the upstairs sitting area had a good view of the ocean and cove at Casper Beach.  The beds were comfortable, nice and quite at night, we enjoyed hearing the seals down on the rocks.  The kitchen was stocked well with just about anything you would need to cook.  We did very little cooking as this was a vacation.  We would like to come back to this house again.  The house was very cozy and we loved the way it was decorated.   A great 4 day week and the sun was out every day and no wind.  Thanks for providing us a great beach house for the Birthday celebration.  We hope to come again.

The Beach House was in a beautiful location with ocean views, in a neighborhood where the deer roamed freely, near coastal access and within walking distance to the Cabrillo Point Lighthouse.

Most importantly, the home was quite cozy and the kitchen was very well supplied with almost anything you need to prepare a great meal.

We live in the area & wanted to show my boyfriend's parents a lovely weekend on the coast. This house was perfect for 2 couples. It has a real seaside charm to it & they allowed us to bring the our 2 dogs which we really appreciated. Spectacular location right by Caspar Beach. Very clean. Huge grassy lot. Would definitely recommend. Cheers!

Great house, great amenities, great location, good views, and deer in the yard most of the day!  We had a great time here and highly recommend it for a nice coastal getaway.

We only wished that the view to the ocean was better.

Photos do not do the Beach House justice, the home and location are absolutely beautiful!  Everything in this rental was spot on perfect and everything you could possibly need was right there.  Looking at the stars at night on the upstairs patio while the light from Cabrillo Point lighthouse beams is beautiful and unforgettable.  The ocean views are amazing and the waves will lull you into the best night's sleep.  There is a lot of character to this little beauty and our family enjoyed every day we were there.  Vacasa was wonderful and very professional to deal with.  Thank you to the owners for sharing this gem and to Vacasa for making everything so easy!  We love this spot and would rent this house again in a heartbeat when we head up the north coast again!!!

We LOVED our stay at the beach house with our two canine best friends.  The views, the large kitchen, the huge yard, the secure garage, and the proximity to the ocean were unbelievable.

The kitchen is HUGE. The whole house is HUGE. The rooms were spacious, not at all cramped. The deck was HUGE and freshly stained. The hot tub was excellent. The code key lock entry system worked so nicely. Giant fireplace. Lots of room outside to run around and explore.

Mendocino Magic was the perfect place for our vacation.  We would most certainly recommend it to others!  We plan on returning sometime in the future.

Was a very pleasing surprise, loved the spacious kitchen, and it's surroundings. Was very close to Fort Bragg and glass beach =)  thank you for allowing us to enjoy your home away from home

My friends and I had a great time. Mendocino Magic is right between Fort Bragg and Mendocino so it was easy to get around.  The home was lovely and well appointed. We had everything we needed for a wonderful stay.

Amazing experience in Mendocino and the Magic enhanced our visit to be very pleasant. The unit was marvelous and had all the amenities you need.

Make sure to ask about the hot tub and what they will refund you if it is not in working order.

We three families really enjoyed the stay at Mendocino magic. We barbecued and had great food in that well equipped Kitchen. House was well set for the visitors. Love to be there again and happy to recommend to others.

My family was very pleased with the home and it's amenities.   The kitchen was fully loaded and the home was very clean.

As soon as we walked in the door we were all pleasantly surprised at the comfortable and well-appointed Mendocino Magic! Its a home that's very well maintained, has an open easy floor plan and that has everything we needed or wanted for our stay. It's quiet, beautifully landscaped and central to both Mendocino and Fort Bragg.

We enjoyed the outdoor hot tub & shower. It was fun to snuggle in by the beautiful rock fireplace to watch Sunday football. We found ourselves a little bit unmotivated to leave to explore the area... it was that comfortable of a home.

We walked right out our door to take the Waterfall Hike in the adjacent Russian Gulch State Park. It was great that we didn't even have to pay park fees to enjoy the park & hike there.

The Wi-Fi is lightening fast, but we did not have AT&T cell coverage.

We would definitely return and stay here again and I highly recommend this home to anyone wanting a beautiful alternative to a hotel or Inn.

The pictures of the house doesn't do it justice.  I looks much smaller in the pictures.  In person the rooms are big and the woodwork and masonry is beautiful.  The dryer didn't dry real well.  They may need a new one.  Eventually the towels got dry but took 2-3 hours to do so.  I would stay here again with no dryer though.  It was very comfortable.

My boyfriend and I had planned a trip to Mendocino and thought it would be more fun if we could stay in a house. We thought the house was charming, nice beachy feel to it. Everything was in great working order except we couldn't get the CD player to work, but no big deal. Saturday we got engaged at Glass Beach and I was so happy we got to come back to the house for a romantic night together by the fire and in the hot tub. This house will now always have a special place in my heart. Thank you for everything!

We had a wonderful time at Palette House. Location and view were great. Easy to walk to town or the headlands. Loved that the place came with bed linens and towels. The house is nicely decorated and homey feeling. One thing to point out is there is only 1 shower. We had 4 teenagers in our group and they all wanted to shower at the same time. But, we made it work.

we went on our honeymoon, the purpose was for peace and quiet, to escape the sacramento heat, and just relax and thats exactly what happened. we biked, walked, and enjoyed the hottub. it wasnt as secluded as i thought but didnt bother me. i did meet a neighbor he was very nice! we will def be back!!

This house is in such a great location and has such staggering views, but it is getting pretty shabby, particularly in the kitchen and the electricity is very odd. I hope at some stage some work is done at the house to bring it more up to standard. Having said that the old sofa was extremely comfortable. We still had a great time and would go back if some improvements were made.

We had a great time at the Palette house, the view from the deck and the living room is absolutely amazing, we saw whales during the day and lots of stars at night. Being a ten-minute walk from downtown Mendocino was really convenient. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again. Another shower would be nice, although there are two bathrooms, there is only one shower, the upstairs bathroom only has a bathtub.

Even though it was rainy on and off through our stay we found it cozy and relaxing. We were still able to pop in and  out  of the shops and enjoy just grabbing some clam chowder and French bread at the market and bringing it back to the house to enjoy it by the fire.

Best view of the half dozen homes we have rented in Mendocino.  Hopefully some of the other issues will get worked out and this will be a top rate rental.

We enjoyed the combination of being a short walk to town and then being out of town with a great view.

My 2 sons, wife, fiance, and grandbaby and I had a relaxing, marvelous time at Pallette House.  We enjoyed the large expanse of 'lawn' with no house near to us off of the back porch.  All appliances, including the hot tub, worked great, bedding was fresh and clean, and walking distance to market and shops in town.  Thanks for a fantastic experience with a view to die for!

Beautiful views, great location near the village.  Nice quiet neighborhood with  pretty gardens.   If the spa worked during our stay, it would have been fantastic.

We rented this property as a family and had such a wonderful experience that we extended our stay by one night.  It's located within walking distance of the restaurants and shops of Mendocino and easy driving distance to local attractions (Pt. Cabrillo lighthouse, Glass Beach, and many others).  The views from the downstairs living area are just wonderful, and we slept at night to the distant crashing of the waves.  We will definitely be back!

Kids (and adults, too!) love having a semi-private loft to play board games or just relax on the couches with their favorite book!

Whether throwing together sandwiches for a backyard picnic or cooking a holiday meal, the chef in the group will love the gourmet kitchen - complete with stainless steel appliances and a professional double-door refrigerator/freezer! There is also an outdoor gas grill. Mealtimes at Sundance are truly a family affair, and plenty of seating options means that everyone will feel included, whether seated at the dining room table or perched at the breakfast bar.

The four light and airy bedrooms are pleasantly decorated to ensure a restful night's sleep. The master bedroom features a king-sized bed, expansive walk-in closet, and a Jacuzzi tub for two with separate shower. Upstairs are two additional bedrooms also furnished with king beds, and the fourth has a full-sized bed. Three full bathrooms ensure plenty of elbow room when it comes to morning and nightly routines!

A total of eight guests can be comfortably accommodated in this chateau! Two lucky canine guests are also welcome to join you during your vacation at Sundance with an additional pet fee. The deep veranda invites enjoyment of the fresh coastal air, and allows outdoor activity even if Mendocino rain appears.

Again, the modern amenities in this home will keep you entertained regardless of the weather! Don't worry about arguing about what to watch or missing your favorite shows, as this home has three wide flatscreen TVs and the ultimate DirecTV package. If you need to stay in touch with the office, the unlimited domestic long distance phone plan and the WiFI allows you to upload pictures to Facebook to show your friends back home how much fun you're having!

No need to overpack, as a washer and dryer are provided for your convenience to keep your clothes fresh and clean.

With a variety of natural treasures and easy access to numerous beaches, Sundance is the ideally located Northern California vacation rental. This charming country cabin provides an endearing escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life that you and your loved ones will cherish for years to come!

Beautiful home and was so happy with the weekend. One little thing you guys should replace is the lighter by the fireplace- it doesn't work. Other than that the house was flawless! Thank you so much!

We recently rented Sundance with another family. It is VERY spacious, simply decorated and clean. There is a ton of safe space for kiddos- inside and out. We really appreciate that Sundance allows dogs- though we have a very clean, dander-free and well behaved pup, we find there are limited places that she can go to.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan on returning (again and again).  Our only suggestion is that the extra fees (such as the cleaning fee) be made a part of the total rental fee as our final bill came as a shock. This is more of a suggestion for VRBO than the Sundance family.

Very nice accomodations, beds exceptional, interior and exterior of the place exceptional, kitchen and common family room modern and roomy...

My friends and I were in town for a wedding and this was the perfect home for us to all be together and enjoy the area. It was a beautiful home with a private and peaceful property. I only wish we were staying for the whole week! Great experience with Vacasa and I can't wait to come back.

We loved this house, it was more than what we had expected and are already planning our next trip! Our little mini labradoodle loved the huge green lawn and had so much fun on the trails in the backyard. Thank you so much for such a clean, well furnished house and the comfortable king beds.

we enjoyed five nights here, our multi-generation family, plenty of room, the house feels very spacious and light, beds are very comfortable.  if you want to do some serious cooking, bring your own gadgets, the kitchen is great but somewhat limited with tools/gadgets, etc, for instance there is no blender or mixer.  all in all a lovely time and a beautiful property!!

The property was lovely, very spacious, but with a power outage and no water, on the coast for an extended period without appropriate supplies seemed a little less like the holiday we planned.

We definitely enjoyed the house and the surrounding area.  It happened to be raining a lot while we were up there, and the house was big enough that we could stay inside and enjoy the rain without feeling cramped.  One suggestion for improvement would be to label the many, many light switches in Sundance.  We had a hard time figuring out which switch did what.  Otherwise, it was great!

I rented the Sundance house for a "reunion" with 7 college friends. It's a spacious house with ample room for 8 people. The kitchen was excellent and and we ate dinner at home every night.  Beds were comfortable and everyone seemed to sleep well.  It's a few miles up the road from town and very close to mountain biking trails, which meant we never had to drive to ride.  We woke up one morning with no power - due to down power lines on the road affecting everyone one the hill and not the fault of the house. Vacasa was quick to call us back to let us know when power was restored. We were still able to make breakfast and returned in the afternoon to the power being back on.  Everyone remarked on how they want to stay here again next year for our mountain biking weekend.

This home is beyond wonderful. It was clean and extremely open and spacious. There were multiple areas for gathering with family or friends. The kitchen is amazing and perfect for being together. There is plenty of seating. The beds were extremely comfortable. The grounds are beautiful and lots of grassy areas to picnic or play. Wonderful for kids to enjoy outside. There are hiking trails near the home too. The wrap around porch is picturesque and wish we could have had time to utilize it more.  We loved staying a little over 5 min inland because we always had sunshine even when it was foggy right on the beach! We are hoping to return again soon. My only wish is that they allowed more than 8 occupants. It would be awesome to have three families stay there. Thank you Vacasa so much. Thank you to the owners for providing such a wonderful place to stay. God bless!

Stayed here quite comfortably with a group of 7 for a family reunion. The house is enormous (in addition to the 4 bedrooms, there's another empty room plus a generous loft area). Very private, but convenient to the town of Mendocino and surrounding parks and coastal attractions.

However, the house was not well stocked (bare-bones kitchen supplies) and had few homey touches (no reading material about the house or the area, closets and shelves completely empty). Come well-prepared with your own supplies and information; though lovely this house lacked the intimate feeling that comes from sharing someone's treasured relaxation space which I've enjoyed at other vacation home rentals.

The house was beautiful, very comfortable and welcoming.  We had a wonderful stay.  We're talking about next year, and staying even longer.

This is a very nice place to stay.  There's so much room that we had plenty of room for 5 couples, and we had everything we needed and only needed to bring food!  We would absolutely recommend this place to others, and we appreciate very much the owners willingness to share their house with us.

Very nice large house in a quiet area three miles from Mendocino (inland).

Visit the gorgeous Northern California Coast with a stay at this charming four-bedroom Mendocino vacation rental! The theme here is all about the beach, fun, and relaxation on the coast. And if any of your group would like extra privacy, the upstairs works well as a private suite with its own kitchenette, bedroom, bathroom, and deck.

Just three hours north of San Francisco, this Seaside getaway is just a hop and a skip away from the heart of the Mendocino Village. Walk to the Mendocino Headlands State Park, visit shops in town, or just walk down to the beach and relax in the sand.

When you first arrive, you'll be greeted with a colorful hammock and outdoor seating before you even enter this Mendocino retreat. The colors bring the sea into the living spaces with a blue-hued beach decor throughout the home. The open living room dining space has a wood-burning fireplace, plenty of seating for conversation, TV or DVD watching or reading a good book. There is also WiFi so you'll be able to stay connected.

The full, colorful kitchen has convenient bar stools to watch and converse with the chef of the day, as well as all major appliances, including a dishwasher. And if the weather is sunny, the door right off the kitchen takes you to another well furnished deck and a propane gas grill - this home is perfect for both outdoor and indoor entertaining!

The main level also has a full bathroom and two wonderfully decorated queen bedrooms, one bedroom with its own half bath. Each room is put together beautifully, the colors, furnishings and art will put you at ease. A third downstairs bedroom just across from the living room has a twin bed and is reminiscent of a traveler's haven.

This two story home has the look of a tug boat with a separate bedroom suite, wood-burning fireplace, TV, and separate entry up at the top. A wide deck with cushioned chairs and a lounger will extend your living space outdoors. The view is serene with a field and trees and a protected pond used by migratory birds.

Depending on the season, you can apply your photo skills to capturing cranes, egrets, ducks stopping for a respite or you can just enjoy the scene. The tidy kitchenette allows you to brew a morning cup and enjoy it on the deck while the rest of your group sleeps-in downstairs.

This gorgeous Mendocino vacation home will sleep up to seven guests! And don't worry about keeping your clothes clean during your stay, you'll even have a washer and dryer.

After you settle in and are inspired by the fun decor, the urge to go to the beach can be satisfied within five minutes at Big River Beach and Preserve. And don't forget to grab boogie boards (the home has three) and kayak! You can slum along the beach or take a short or long hike along the river or better yet, stop by Catch a Canoe & Bicycles Too across from the river for boat rentals, tours and bike rentals.

Experience a spectacular sunset from the beach and follow-up with a stop at Patterson's Pub for local brews and good eats. Of course, if you want to enjoy gourmet meals and renowned local wines, there is Cafe Beaujolais and 955 Ukiah Street Restaurant right next to each other on popular Ukiah Street.

Another night, plan on picking up the evening meal from Harvest Market at Mendosa's where you'll find an olive bar, an old fashion meat counter, extensive wine and beer selection, organic produce, and anything else you are looking for to create your own gourmet meal at this Seaside Mendocino vacation home with family and friends.

This Northern California vacation rental is meant to be enjoyed as a home-away-from-home on the stunning Mendocino coast. After a stay here, you'll find that it's worth repeating, once is simply not enough, so plan on coming back again and again to enjoy the beautiful village of Mendocino!

Seaside is a great option for groups of 6-7. We found that as a group of 7 mountain bikers we had nice sleeping accommodations, and space to spread out. Multiple outdoor seating arrangements allowed  us to take in the best part of the day from three vantage points. We have stayed in Mendocino many times and this was our favorite lodging experience thus far!

Seascape was a fallback reservation for us on a double booked reservation. Although the house was not particularly attractive from the exterior, and close to the highway, a lot of thoughtful consideration had gone into making the interior very charming and comfortable. We will definitely try to rent here again.

The location was perfect and the property beautiful.  The beds were very comfortable and the house itself  was very well maintained.  I would highly recommend this home to anyone.

With its unique slanted roof-style and interior redwood beams, this contemporary five-bedroom Mendocino vacation rental is a dream come true! Designed by modern artist-turned-architect David Clayton, this Crane Dance Retreat has sweeping ocean views, a beautiful garden courtyard, private redwood hot tub, and unique architectural touches throughout. And you can bring up to two dogs as well, so no one has to stay behind!

The centerpiece of the sunken living room is the massive stone-faced, wood-burning fireplace. Throw another log on the fire while you enjoy a peaceful evening at home. You'll be thoroughly charmed by this home's unique art,  knick-knacks, and redwood accents along the living room's two-story walls. There's a TV for entertainment, as well as cable, a DVD player, VCR, and WiFi.

Part of this level's open floor plan includes a full kitchen and dining area. Socialize around the large wooden countertop while you sip some wine and chop some vegetables. With enough room for kitchen helpers, this space will be one of the most popular areas of the house! Stocked with all the major appliances, including a dishwasher, this kitchen will be the start of many amazing vacation feasts. But if you want to do some cooking outside, there's a charcoal grill for fixing up some chicken thighs or rosemary-balsamic flank steak.

All on one level, the bedrooms are separated into wings - one with two bedrooms and the other with three. On the west side, there's an ocean view room and a courtyard room. While on the east, the master suite has its own fireplace, deck access, and a gorgeous private bathroom featuring a large tiled shower with stunning outdoor views. Also on this wing, is another ocean view bedroom, and one that looks out onto the garden courtyard.

Here you'll have four queen beds and one full bed, allowing this beautiful and unique Mendocino vacation home to sleep up to 10 guests. And if you want to bring your pets, two dogs are welcome with a $10 per day, per pet fee ($40 minimum per stay). Other amenities include a washer and dryer, so you can pack light when you stay here.

From the back deck, it's just a short walk to an up-close view of the rugged, Northern California coastline. But you may find that you're content to relax and soak away on the deck's redwood hot tub. On clear nights, you can even look up and admire the stars while listening to the waves crash below.

And when you want to visit the sand, it's a short drive to Russian Gulch, Point Cabrillo, Mendocino Headlands State Park, and other beach areas. From your Crane Dance Retreat, the village of Mendocino is less than three miles south. Bring your bikes and make the journey along Highway 1 or take the car and be in town in about five minutes.

Other nearby attractions include spending the day in Fort Bragg, just nine miles to the north. Plan a scenic hike right near downtown Fort Bragg at the Pudding Creek Trestle along the scenic Ten Mile Beach Trail. After you've worked up an appetite, stop at the Headlands Coffee House for an afternoon treat before heading back to your Mendocino getaway.

This architectural gem in Mendocino is an ideal Northern California Coast vacation rental! With it's private hot tub, amazing ocean views, unique design, and short distance into town, your whole group will love spending time at this lovely Crane Dance Retreat.

Other houses may have 5 bedrooms and a spectacular view of the ocean, they may have excellent kitchens with all the amenities, they may even have a greatroom where five people can all lie down and read in comfort at the same time.  They may even be located close to downtown Mendocino's dining and shops, but I doubt they have the grand huge fireplace.;I doubt they have the great decks in front and back, and I KNOW they don't have the unbelievably beautiful architecture:  enormous old redwood beams, nooks and shelves everywhere, greatroom  ceiling so high it takes your breath away. We love it.  It is unique.

Crane Dance is in a great location.  We enjoyed running and walking in the area.  It is a short drive to either Mendocino or Fort Bragg.  The view of the sunset was spectacular.  The house is spacious yet comfortable.  The 10 of us had an unforgettable experience.

Overall, a great spot to come and relax.  We love to cook- a detailed and complete list of kitchen supplies would have been nice.  We brought a lot of our own not knowing what to expect.  But to our surprise, there is quite a bit of culinary equipment to use there!

we love everything except the house needs a good cleaning and the hot tub jets did not work well . we wold stay again!!!!!

The location of the house is great and the house itself is large and comfortable.  But the house was pretty dirty and generally speaking wasn't in very good shape (lots of burned out light bulbs, etc.) I would stay there again, but the house needs a bit of TLC.

Private hot tub with the ocean a few steps away

Ready to take that ultimate beach vacation you've been thinking about? This dreamy Fort Bragg vacation rental is almost too beautiful to believe! Host all your friends or bring the whole family out for a relaxing week - this five-bedroom abode is literally a few steps away from the ocean and sleeps up to 14!

This conveniently located home is perfect for anyone who wants to feel the solitude of the rolling waves of the Pacific, yet be only 15 minutes away from the bars, bakeries, and shopping of Fort Bragg. Go horseback riding along the Ten Mile Beach or head to the local winery (just 10 minutes away!) for some relaxation between swimming or surf sessions. Mendocino is also only 30 minutes south for even more (relatively) urban entertainment.

Recently remodeled, this one-level home has a fresh feel, while letting the beauty of the ocean speak for itself. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide incredible views, and the wooden floors and modern amenities make everything feel pristine yet welcoming. The solar collector also means this place has gone green - so leave your eco guilt at home!

The living room is open and inviting with a giant sectional sofa, gas fireplace, and awesome views. Connected to the open kitchen and dining room, there's plenty of room for people to congregate. The 14-foot kitchen island means there's enough space for six people to sit and chat over a glass of red wine while the cook gets crafty, or for the kids to sit and munch in the morning before hitting the beach.

The enormous deck wraps around the entire backside of the house, and there's a table perfect for dinner while catching the sunset. The private hot tub on the other side of the deck is sure to relax your sore muscles after a solid day of surfing or hiking along the beach.

The master bedroom has floor-to-ceiling glass windows covering half of the walls, so greeting the ocean first thing in the morning is a great way to start the day. With a romantic queen-size bed and soft carpet beneath your toes, this bedroom is a perfect place to cozy up for a snooze.

Three of the other bedrooms also boast queen-size beds, meaning there's plenty of room for everyone to get some much-needed rest, and the last bedroom has two twin beds that the kids will love to sleep (or jump!) on. There's also a game room with Ping-pong and foosball tables to satisfy your competitive edge, or just relax and play one of the many puzzles or boardgames available. With wireless Internet, satellite cable, and a whole bunch of DVDs to choose from, everyone will stay entertained when the sun sets on another day at the beach.

With the picturesque stone pinnacles and sandy beach literally in the backyard, this home is the perfect base for a walk along the coast, a surf session, or roasting marshmallows over a bonfire onshore. Several state parks, including MacKerricher and Jug Handle, are also nearby, adding to your outdoor options for hiking, biking, and nature-watching. With Fort Bragg and Mendocino a short drive away, it's easy to access the perks of the city while maintaining your sense of beach solitude.

Whichever way you choose to spend your seaside holiday, this well-equipped, beach-friendly home is certain to satisfy your needs. It doesn't matter if the sun's up or down: this  has something for everyone!

Staying at the Shell Seeker creates a memorable family time. You get to be in one location and cook amazing family meals. We love staying here and have been staying at the Shell Seeker for 4 years.

We have stayed at this home the last week in April for the past four years.   We always say we will try some where else but why... this has the perfect location and perfect floor plan for entertaining.      Check out the pictures on the website... just a taste of how nice this home is.

We had a great family get together here.  I rented this house and another one on the same road, we had my family in one house and my husbands family in the other.  The beach nearby provided us hours of fun. We love the Mendocino Coast!

Amazing and coazy house the views are breathtaking,  love the private beach acess, the garage game room is wonderful, the neighborhood is so loveley and peaceful. Will be back soon for our 3rd stay

Second time we stayed in this wonderful house. We had three couples, and would have had four but one couple couldn't make it. The house is plenty big for a large group to enjoy meals and get togethers as well as quiet alone time. The open kitchen/dining/living space is huge and perfect for gathering. The view is entrancing. A beautiful beach is a short walk away. I could live there in a hot second!
#Pathname:/usa/California/Fort-Bragg/
Fort Bragg, with a newly revitalized downtown and a decidedly hippie bent, is the laid-back commercial center along the Mendocino coast. For the most relaxing getaway, reserve one of our lovely Fort Bragg vacation rentals: from cooking your own meals to soaking in your private hot tub, there's no better way to experience this unique California town!

Fort Bragg is a military town only in the historic sense: in 1857, it was established as a military outpost that was abandoned within a decade (that other Fort Bragg is in North Carolina). Today, Fort Bragg's order of business is primarily tourism. With over 7,000 year-round residents, it's the largest town along the Coast, and home to the highest concentration of shops, restaurants, and other services in the area... but surrounded by peaceful beaches and hiking trails to explore.

The downtown area is a lovely spot to while away the occasional rainy day. Stop by Headlands Coffee for a latte to sip as you wander among the unique shops and galleries: downtown Fort Bragg is home to everything from a specialty sock store to a tattoo museum and a fantastic art collective. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants to keep you well-fed, along with North Coast Brewing Company and the excellent Roundman's Smoke House for smoked sausages, fish, and cheeses of all kinds.

Pack up your picnic supplies and head for the great outdoors! Nature lovers of all types will find the perfect afternoon activity in and around Fort Bragg. The Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens are just south of town, a beautiful cliff-top hideout of flowers, streams, picnic areas, and walking trails. Fishermen and kayakers will find plenty of spots to launch a boat or drop a line, thanks to the two creeks that flank downtown and the numerous sea caves and quiet bays lining the coast.

Just north of town is MacKerricher State Park, with miles of trails suitable for hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. And, of course, there are plenty of smaller villages and hamlets to explore during your stay. Charming Mendocino is just 15 minutes south, and the more rural hamlets of Albion and Elk, California are within a 40-minute drive as well. Each offers its own unique take on the peaceful, laid-back pace of life that epitomizes the Coast.

For those who want to explore the Mendocino coast without getting too far away from it all, consider booking one of our Fort Bragg vacation rentals today.

You'll be so close to the ocean that you'll be able to feel the Pacific mists when you stay at this gorgeous, oceanfront Albion vacation rental. Right from the living room and master bedroom, you'll have stunning views of the rocky, northern California shoreline. Add to that a private hot tub, entertainment amenities, and a magnificent, secluded locale and it just doesn't get better than this two-bedroom Mendocino country retreat.

Ideal for two couples vacationing together, a romantic getaway, or even an unforgettable honeymoon, you'll be surrounded by the sights and sounds of the Pacific Ocean. In the classically designed living room, you can settle in for the night on the red sofa for an evening in front of the wood burning fireplace. Use the telescope to observe the stars on a clear evening or during the day, keep an eye out for migrating whales.

The full kitchen is bright and well-stocked with pots and pans, glasses, silverware, and everything you'll need for a lively weekend brunch to a romantic meal for two. There's a stovetop/oven refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and grinder, and more. You will have to do dishes by hand here, but you can always head out to the deck and take in a stunning sunset first, while the dishes soak in the sink.

Lovely French doors lead to the master suite, with its ocean view, king sized bed, and private master bath (including a walk-in shower big enough for two). The second bedroom has a queen sized bed, with easy access to the second bathroom. Both bedrooms feature wall-mounted flat screen TVs with DISH satellite service and DVD players. This Albion getaway will sleep up to four guests, as well as two dogs with a $10 per day, per pet fee ($40 minimum per stay).

As nice as this Pacific Mists vacation cottage is on the inside, when you step outdoors onto the deck, you'll truly fall in love with this getaway! Watch the waves crash into rocks, view osprey flying overhead, or use the charcoal grill to fix a summer feast. In the evenings, you can relax in the hot tub while you listen to the ocean waves.

Other amenities at this wonderful Albion vacation home include a washer and dryer, WiFi, and a stereo. And while you may be tempted to spend all your time at the house, soaking in the hot tub and enjoying the living room's fireplace and view, there are plenty of attractions nearby.

If you don't feel like making a meal in, head just a couple of miles north for two of the best restaurants on the northern California Coast - the Ledford House and the Albion River Inn Restaurant. And if you continue all the way to Mendocino (eight miles from the house), you'll have even more dining options. Mendocino is also a great destination for an afternoon of gallery browsing, walking along the trails of the Mendocino Headlands State Park, or just enjoying a scenic drive along California's Highway 1.

Other nearby attractions include Van Damme State Park in Little River, Pacific Star Winery just north of Fort Bragg, and the Navarro River Redwoods State Park, eight miles southeast in Elk.

Less than three hours north of San Francisco, this beautiful and peaceful Northern California Coast vacation rental in sleepy little Albion is a hidden gem. Wake to the sounds of waves crashing, watch for whales out on the deck, and escape to this amazing and rejuvenating Mendocino Country retreat.

Attention abalone divers: Pacific Reefs Residential Community prohibits ocean access from any property.

Albion was my final destination of a 2 week vacation and it was absolutely amazing. Rustic but comfortable. Everything we needed was there, easily checkin and out, loved the comfort of the bed and bedding and hot tub was great. My only suggestion would be to have some sort of screen door or for windows to sleep with the sound of the ocean without leaving door open for flies and any other critters. One complaint out of control was the fog that stayed around 3:4 days and hardly could visualize water or sunsets. Can you please have Mother Nature correct that for our next visit lol. We will definitely be back!!! A new romance has blossomed there.

Ann Broussard

The view was spectacular.  We saw whales, pelicans flying by (it felt so close you could reach out and touch them), the sound of the waves was heavenly.   This was such a peaceful place.  You almost feel like you are alone in the world, except for the few neighbors homes you can see.  Loved it.  At night we would lay in the very nice king size bed and read (perfection).

We had gorgeous clear weather during our stay which made all the difference taking in the panoramic views of the ocean side.  I never got tired of looking out the window, and we even saw a few late whales pass through!  Property is very private and clean.   Would have liked walking trails in the community but they were a short car ride.    I saw on another review the tip to open the kitchen window to prevent a smokey room with the fireplace, great idea.   Another tip:  we received a notice around 10am on check in day that we were given an early check in of 11 am.  Unfortunately our plans already revolved around the 4pm check in and we couldn't change things to take advantage of the extra time.  I recommend checking the availability calendar and be prepared for a possible early check in if the property is vacant before your stay.  Enjoy, this beautiful spot and your dogs will love it too. :)

The best. Sitting in the hot tub watching for whale blows, while sipping wine. Nice seclusion. The views from inside out are great. Up early everyday  just to take it all in. We cooked supper there. The view could not be beat. Heck yeah.... we will be back !

We couldn't have asked for a more beautiful little house perched on the cliff. The property was private and just right for what we were looking for- some days to hang out..recharge.. and relax.

Modest on the outside but gorgeous inside.  not to mention the stunning location...

we were without power 3 of the original nights due to heavy rains and very heavy (hurricane force) winds. We had to go to the hardware store just 2 minutes away and buy camping supplys to cook with and have light. The hardware store owners said that we were GLAMPING. Glamorous Camping. We also ran out of firewood. The Mendocino staff eventually brought us more and they also gave us 2 more free nights of stay. Thank you Ray for your help with this.

This is a unique vacation rental. We liked that it was in a gated community and pretty much away from everything other than the 30 or so houses in the development. Quiet and secluded.

It has obviously been remodeled recently. All new paint, remodeled master bath, new windows, new washer/drier - yet it still retains a bit of the rustic with original wood floors, etc. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this and will rent again in the future.

Hints: The fireplace can smoke a bit when first lighting the fire. I think it is because with the new windows, etc. the place is pretty airtight. We solved the problem by opening the kitchen window when starting the fire.

Kitchen is a little small and not as updated. Not a 2-person kitchen. But did have new sink and faucet.

There is a little bench on the edge of the cliff a little north of the house. It can't be seen from the house or the deck but it has an awesome view. We didn't find it until we were about to leave. Don't miss it!

Not worth the money.I've stayed at comparable  places for much less.

hot tub fee is rediculous.

Beautiful ocean view, right on the edge of the ocean.  Very comfortable home.  We felt very much at home and settled in right away.  Just hated to have to leave.  We will definitely visit Pacific Mist again.

Fantastic location, fabulous view of the coast. Well stocked with the essentials. Vacasa crew very helpful. Internet pretty slow but at least it has it. Interior looks like it was recently painted and master bath is beautiful. This is the place to go.

Stunning views with incredible sunsets. New law dictates that properties have a setback from the bluff edge; but this property precedes that. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better view. That said, I'd recommend this location with the caveat that it's on the aged and musty side.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Albion/
Quiet, charming Albion, just 15 minutes south of the village of Mendocino, is a beautiful retreat perched above the meandering Albion River. Home to a historic, WWII-era wooden bridge, Albion is an especially picturesque hamlet along the scenic Mendocino coast. For a truly relaxing retreat, book one of our lovely Albion vacation rentals and learn just how peaceful California can really be.

Albion proper is small and quiet, but offers a few conveniences that travelers will appreciate, like a full-service grocery store. There's also a pair of excellent dining options for special nights out, including the Ledford House and the restaurant at the Albion River Inn. Mendocino has even more choices, and the comparatively bustling commercial center of Fort Bragg is less than half an hour north.

The true attraction of Albion is the natural beauty. While the town itself is spectacularly positioned above the churning Pacific Ocean, there are trails to hike, rivers to kayak, and forests to explore further inland. Just north of town is Van Damme State Park, and to the south is the gorgeous Navarro River, flanked by old-growth redwoods.

When you're looking for a truly relaxing Mendocino vacation rental, consider choosing quiet, beautiful little Albion!

Looking for the perfect family reunion spot? Look no further than Captain Phil's gorgeous five-bedroom Albion vacation rental offering ocean views, a gourmet kitchen, fireplace, and private hot tub!

The brand new vacation home is located just South of the village of Mendocino in a quaint coastal community. Nestled amongst the California Redwood Forest and the Little Salmon Creek, the home is the ideal spot to set back the clock and regain some peace and solitude. A five-minute drive will offer beautiful views of Albion River Bridge, a WWII era wooden trestle bridge, shopping, and oysters and artisan cheese plates at the Ledford House.

This sea-themed getaway has exposed wood ceilings, ornate driftwood carvings, soft leather touches, and a statue of the Captain Phil himself! The large social areas, including the living room, kitchen, and dining room are upstairs in this second-story vacation home. Feel instantly at ease in the open-concept living room, with its soft leather reclining loveseats and sofa. The loveseats are huddled around a unique carved wood coffee table base with a glass top, and frame the large rock fireplace and flatscreen TV.

The media center offers cable, a CD player, and a surround sound stereo system to create a theater-style movie night! You and guests will gaze into the fire or absorb the nearly panoramic views of the Pacific ocean thanks to floor to ceiling windows overlooking the expansive patio.

Just off the living room is an exquisite kitchen with custom wood cabinets, granite countertops, and stainless-steel appliances including a built-in microwave, oven, gas range grill top stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, toaster, coffeemaker and French press, double sink, and plenty of cutting boards and kitchen accessories to serve large meals. An expansive granite kitchen island will allow you to prep lunches for your ocean adventures, and a table top wine rack will store the bottles you brought for your special family vacation! Just off the kitchen is a formal dining room with a wood table for eight. At the heart of the table is a twisted carved wood centerpiece.

Two sets of sliding glass doors off the main living area lead to the expansive patio, complete with a whimsical wooden carving of Captain Phillip steering the ship, and a mermaid figurehead at the eve of the roof. Slather up with sunscreen and lounge in the Adirondack chairs on the deck which overlooks the grassy knoll and rolling waves. Take the aluminum canoe out for an adventure, and when the mood is right, slip into your bathing suit for a romantic dip in the private patio hot tub overlooking the sea!

At night, this spacious home offers five bedrooms, four full bathrooms and comfortably sleeps 10 people. Two master suits are upstairs, one with a king and the one with a queen-sized bed. Downstairs is three additional guest rooms with queen-sized beds, and a regal game room with an ornate claw-foot pool table with red felt, vintage signs, studded leather barstools, and a chainsaw carving of a bear. Don't forget to pack your gadgets!

Drive just 10 minutes for geocaching, fishing, and boating to where locals call “the redwood tunnel to the sea” at Navarro River Redwoods State Park. Make the 15-minute drive to Mendocino where you can go whale watching, board a charter fishing boat, browse book shops and galleries, or enjoy a pulled pork sandwich and local brew at Patterson's Pub.

No matter how you spend your time - kayaking the sea, butter dipping Dungeness crab in a local restaurant, or soaking in the hot tub, this gorgeous Northern California Coast vacation rental is the perfect spot for you and your family to relax with all the comforts of home and appreciate your time together in beautiful Albion.

Didn't want to leave here...

This beautiful home surpassed our expectations. The pictures truly do not do this house justice. The wraparound deck it's just amazing. The property is beautiful and the views of the ocean are just breathtaking. We will definitely be booking another vacation, but this time a lot longer!!!! Thank you owners, property managers and of course Vacasa, for making our family vacation experience something to talk about for years. Memories were made!! The house is comfortable for eight people. The kitchen supplied everything we needed (and more) and again, the beauties of the home are worth experiencing! If we had millions of dollars we would want to buy that house :)

RETURNING VERY SOON!!!!!!!

Unbelievable house, beautiful and unique.  So many excellent places to go nearby.  Only downside was two beautiful beaches on either side with difficult beach access.  Not recommended if you have kids who want to run around (cliffs) but we will definitely be back to stay!!!

The location is unbelievable!  We saw whales while sitting on the deck. I would love to go back for a longer stay.  House was very clean.  The house was so amazing we spent most of our time there although we did also go to the botanical gardens and a local state beach. Loved that it was also dog friendly!

The house was beautiful, pictures do not do justice.  Kitchen well appointed, quality cookware, dinnerware, all the bedding and towels you need. No dishwasher was the only negative on the kitchen.  Every room has its own heat controls, views galore.  You are on the edge of the ocean with bluffs right outside the door to walk on, as well as a private beach that can be accessed on the right side, you just have to hunt it.  Hot tub was clean well placed, protected yet with some ocean views.  Beds and bedrooms were very comfortable.  Living room as well, all rooms really.  Cable, WiFi and a land-line.  Cell phones pretty much are not workable in most areas along the coast.  Fort Bragg however has great cell phone reception.  Overall we loved the home and its unique craftsmanship. The home is so well insulated you had to open the window or door to hear the ocean which is directly off the house. We also loved the beautiful grounds, well maintained as well as the privacy, and again, the views.  It was even better and more comfortable then I had imagined.  For the night sky gazers it was outstanding with no city lights to distract.  We were lucky enough to observe a rare 22 degree halo around the moon one evening.  Something I had heard about but never have seen.  SO to sum it up if your looking for a relaxing, quiet, beautiful ocean edge home this is it.  Has everything you need just bring the change of clothes & shoes and your camera!

Beautiful property would go back again

My wife and I were so bedazzled when  arriving at the property we were like kids at the candy store. we were amazed as to the proximity of the house to the private beach right below the balcony(low tide others can get to the private beach but we seen no one)

Totally private home. Also, some rentals I have been in have a minimum amount of cook wear, dishes, glasses, etc, but this place had more then I could ever use. the utensils were top quality with every thing imaginable was there for our use.

Ocean views from 80% of the home was a dream come true!

If I had millions of dollars, I would buy this house in a heart beat. But just staying there the weekend was a blessing. I will come back next time and stay a week. The house sitting is beautiful and I am very please with the comfort the house offered. It was located in a perfect sitting close to town but far enough to feel secluded.

Everything was great. The only thing I can help improve on is let everybody know there is no cell signal at all, Verizon or AT&T.. Finding front door difficult at first and in instruction Manuel where to find hot tub key. No Instructions on TV in  north room.the last person had it on wrong channel and took a while to get programing back with no instructions. Enjoyed complete stay and will come back for sure.  Thanks Rob.

We had a great time and would not have changed anything.

We spent our honeymoon at The Ocean breeze. We loved every minute of our stay. The house is comfortable and unique. The surroundings are truly magical and majestic. Three of us rattled around the house (our dog loved everything as well), but we wouldn't have had it any other way. We look forward to calling this our anniversary home.

You feel like there is nobody else around with open views and plenty of state land to wander.

This location is beautiful. We had a wonderful time!

This home really is a fantastic and unique place.  We always look forward to our visit and feel fortunate to have had the experience of listening to the pounding surf, watching the waves crash and knowing that the house brings happiness and peace to all who enter.

I was a bit skeptical as the ad for this home seemed too good to be true. But I am happy to report that it was everything it claimed to be! Can't wait to come back for an even longer stay...

We had 5 adults and one child.  The setting is fantastic.  The views are great as is the privacy.  One car maximum rule is a little odd if the place sleeps 8 though.  This is a very comfortable house that is close to Fort Bragg.  Two bedrooms plus two hide-a-beds works great for 2 or 3 couples but one hide-a-bed is in the kitchen area which was ok because we put the 7 year old there.  :)  Two big thumbs up.

We loved it.  The house is beautiful and the property is amazing with awesome views on both sides, we took hikes to the beach on the property next to the house.

You'll find many a spot to relax and read outdoors.

Mendocino and Fort Bragg are both nearby, and offer a wealth of dining and outdoor opportunities. Mendocino has myriad ocean bluffs at which to gaze upon the wonder of the sea.

We were so happy to find this house that has the ocean view from the deck, as well as every room in the house.  One other of our favorites was the frog pond.  They serenaded us every evening.  Deer made their way through the back yard in the mornings.  It is just a perfect place.

The calling of the osprey and their newly fledged offspring was the finale to our stay. The ocean varied between crashing waves and seeming like a lake. The wildlife made it seem like we were in a National Geographic special. Lots of pictures were taken from the expansive decks. We will definitely recommend and hope to return soon.

The house is ample in size for small groups.  With only 6 bedrooms if this house were booked to capacity then at least 4 persons are sleeping on the side beds and roll-aways in the living room.  All of the linens are dated and need to be replaced.  The downstairs carpet is nearing the end of it's usable life and is heavily stained.  The fridge is small - we had 5-6 guests and filled it to capacity.  There was no mini-fridge in the bar area which would have helped with the low fridge capacity.  Most mattresses in the bedrooms were fine, the two twins out in the main downstairs rooms were very firm.  The view is stunning on both nice and stormy days and we enjoyed a lot of time just relaxing with the view.  The outside space is enjoyable - plenty of deck space.  A portable gas grill instead of charcoal would help with outdoor cooking.  The next door neighbor (tenant?) while nice enough and approachable does smoke outside which does waft towards the house with the prevailing northwest winds that come with this area of the coast.  It's a nice house and an excellent view.  But the view can't hold this property alone and it would benefit from some freshening up of some amenities.

The view from all rooms of the house was wonderful.  The house was had enough beds to accommodate lots of people.  We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood, the geese on the cliff and the botanical gardens nearby.

I need to start this by saying that there were 6 guys and no women on this stay. All of us have lived in rustic housed before.......

Got to the house at 4 pm and and cleaning person said they needed and extre 20 minutes. Should have gave them another day.... Carpet was stained and dirty, kitchen table was dirty, there were ants and mice visible. The hot tub was so dirty nobody wanted to use it. We got to watch tenents come and go through the yard.

We will be returning to this property again. My family and I had a blast, thank you allowing us to stay.

Came here for a girls' getaway weekend and had a wonderful time.  There were storms in the area, unfortunately, and no power when we showed up the first night.  Power was restored the next morning and we really enjoyed our stay.  The property is beautiful and the house is more than comfortable.  The location is perfect, right on the ocean, with amazing views.  Close to town, whale watching (bad weather prevented this for us), beaches and lighthouses.  We'll be returning with our families for another trip sometime soon.

The views were worth the stay. They were priceless. Leaving the bedroom doors slightly open all night made sleeping easy, listening to the massive breakers crashing on the rocks below. The central heat was not working; however, they did provide space heaters that were adequate. We were looking forward to a Jacuzzi in the evening; however it was not working. We aware that there is a small guest home on the property and that someone is actually living there. The house was adequate but not what we considered to be clean or kept up.

Sea Cove is right on the bluffs overlooking the ocean.  The sunroom and kitchen were great family spaces.  We saw whales, enjoyed local hikes, and enjoyed a perfect Christmas away from home.

We want to come back next year if I can come up with money

We were informed that the house had a plumbing leak repaired just prior to our visit. The whole in the bathroom wall wasn't a surprise, the lack of hot water was. Once we figured out the breaker was off for the water heater everything was fine.

This house is good for a crowd and multiple families. The kids enjoyed the ping pong table in the garage, and the yard is nice and big. We didn't get a chance to use the fire pit, but the hot tub was nice and warm.  The kitchen is nicely stocked with just about every utensil you could ever need. We were decorating 150 cupcakes for a wedding and the HUGE kitchen table came in very handy. This was our second stay in the house and we would recommend without hesitation.

We had a wonderful stay in this cozy cottage!  We found it very clean & well equipped.  The Hot Tub & views were great!!  Neighborhood stairs (83 steps) made a convenient way down to the amazing beach.   Cant wait to come back!

Two sisters, Husbands and 4 kids.  Great getaway for the entire family.  Safe location with plenty to explore around the beach, sea caves and River outlet just a short walk away.  We all had a great, quiet and relaxing family getaway.

We had a great stay at the cottage.  The weather was perfect and the views amazing!  We had everything we needed when we arrived and having a washer/dryer was a plus.  We saw a skunk, raccoon,  hummingbirds and other wildlife from the back deck.  The beds were comfy and the accommodations were everything we needed.  The locals were nice and we found something new to do every day.  We look forward to coming back next year.

We chose this property because of the location. We had our wedding on the beach behind the property and wanted easy beach access. The access is much steeper and farther than it appears in the pics, but it is doable. The views are amazing. Unfortunately, the guy came to cut the brush on our last day so we missed out on having the cliff views for our wedding pics. The house is fine, not anything fancy, but it is clean. We didn't spend a lot of time inside so it worked for us. The wifi is very spotty.  We enjoyed the deck and hot tub. Overall we were pleased with our stay here.

A very clean and quiet neighborhood. Plenty of privacy. This was our best stay near Fort Bragg ever!!!  We will definitely stay here again.

The location of this cottage is wonderful-beautiful ocean views and convenient beach access(a little steep-take it slow). We had a great time. The Noyo headlands and Glass Beach are very convenient  and interesting, also MacKerricher State Park(we saw harbor seals and babies there).

This place is located in a quite neighborhood with great beach views and access. The trail looks steeper than it is. I carried my child up and down while wearing flip flops and had no issues of slipping. The pass through room to the outside has its own fire place heater which being able to hear the ocean while sitting next to the fire was nice and relaxing. The heater in the main part of the house is loud but if you shut the door to the entryway it cuts down the noise. Wasn't loud enough to wake up our 14 month old. The house is about 10 minutes from fort bragg so you might want to stop for anything you might need before you get here. Overall we had a great experience and our son had a wonderful first trip to the beach.

This is a great house for two couples and a few kids.  The beds in the 3rd room are twins and a little tight for a couple.  But we made do and had a great time.  Very well appointed house, gourmet kitchen and huge yard with a private back patio perfect for relaxing.  The front porch is another great spot to hang out and watch the birds and ocean.  I met one of the Vacasa guys and he was terrific and very friendly.

We had a wonderful stay at Dream Scape. The house is in a great location with a view of the ocean and has been beautifully remodeled. My three kids LOVED the huge yard and ran around all day! Would definitely stay here again and tell my friends!

We cannot say enough about our wonderful stay. It was nice from the onset with our reservation, when we arrived and throughout our stay. The view from the living room, kitchen and dining area was perfect. My mother is 93 and commented how nicely the home is laid out. We will be back!

Our stay at Dream Scape was wonderful and relaxing. It's in a very convenient location a mile from the Botanical Gardens and short drive to Fort Bragg.  A big plus for us was the large grassy lawn where we could run our two small dogs. The back patio was extremely pleasant and we had our coffee out there in the mornings.  The furnishings and beds were super comfortable and kitchen was well appointed.  The only thing I could have wanted was a bigger view of the ocean but overall a very pleasant and experience and would highly recommend.

We loved the location as it was quiet - no other people that we saw nearby even though there are houses.  View was great and the cabin had all the amenities we needed.

Our week in Safe at Anchor was sensational.  When we first arrived we were ecstatic to see how secluded, rustic and gorgeous the cabin was.  The seclusion makes all the difference in the world when you're with 3 dogs.  But even without the canine factor, this cabin is a great choice.  Huge window with a view over the woods into the ocean, secluded hot tub, woodstove,.....Fabulous.  We were just one couple with our dogs but this would be an ideal place for two couples.

We spent a lovely weekend at Safe at Anchor. The view from the window is just as pretty as it looks in the pictures. We had a great time hiking through the redwoods in Hendy Woods State Park and watching whales and sea lions at MacKerricher Beach. It felt great to relax in the hot tub after an active day.

If you don't already know, and are visiting in winter, read up on the safe way to split kindling for the wood burner. ;-)

This was an ideal location to get away from it all and enjoy Gods creation.

This property is secluded yet close to many good spots to kayak from and places to visit.  It's charming and cozy and I would definitely stay again.   Know that internet service is intermittent.

Setting is private and idyllic, rustic and beautiful. Everything as promised. Arrangements and property management outstanding. Area gorgeous and owners incredibly thoughtful and generous in all the kind ways they have arranged place to be a welcoming respite for guests.

I only had two suggestions - I could not operate bedroom TV ("no signal" message), but I am not familiar with fancy systems so I was pretty sure it was me. I knew if I called I could get support but I don't watch much TV so didn't bother. I also had planned to use the barbecue but it looks like some guests have not cleaned the barbecue grill and it was rusted and it could use a replacement grill.

Those however are just refinements on how to make perfection even more perfect. We had a fantastic time; I really appreciated being able to bring my dogs, it is a beautiful and well-managed property and we had a wonderful time. Thank you so much.

I could sit and look at the ocean from this place all day. We saw whales while sitting on the couch :-)

It took us about 5 hours(!) to get here from the Mission in SF due to pre holiday traffic. But is is so removed from city life it was worth it. Maybe leave a day earlier next time. Getting home was only 3.5 hours.

A comfortable shelter from the big storm. Lots of amenities to appreciate in this rustic home, which would best be considered as a one bedroom due to limited  exterior only access to the 2nd bedroom, which is located in a musty area under the main living space. There is abundant firewood supplied, and everything you could possibly need for substantial cooking. The ocean view is great, and adds to the relaxation of the hot tub. Even though an awesome storm caused downed trees and power outages throughout the coastal communities, we

truly felt Safe at Anchor despite a two day outage. The property manager, Ray, really delivered by leaving a big bag of ice, emergency candles and a great lantern. We will definitely return!

This house is fantastic. Perfect getaway to relax and enjoy nature. It's a quick drive to Mendocino and Fort Bragg with lots to do in between. The home was clean and quiet and the perfect place to unwind. I love the eclectic decor and comfort it offers as well as the amazing view of the ocean.

To have this place to myself for a week to do some writing and reading (and general relaxing -- hello hot tub) was heaven. A perfect experience I would gladly repeat. The cabin was stuffed with extras, but deep in the woods you could still feel very roomed from civilization. Can't wait to come back.

Can't beat the view!!!!  The quiet, the beauty and peacefulness

We loved this house! The views from the living room and the hot tub were amazing! Very relaxing and refreshing! The town of Mendocino was a great spot to stroll and dine and the nearby states parks were great for hiking! Would definitely recommend to other travelers.

Beautiful view, hot tube is wonderful.  Cabin size quit cozy compared to what I'm use to. Not great on comfortable seating.  I found myself craving a nice comfortable chair, with good lighting, and an ottoman to put my feet up, to do some reading.    All in all, very nice.  ( side note:  was listed as pet friendly.  after arriving  there and reading the cabin rules, dogs not allowed on any furniture, and to be on a leash at all times when outside the cabin. )

Great quiet and secluded location perfect for a romantic vacation or fellowship with friends.  The cabin is beautiful and cozy.  Cell phone service is non-existent (a plus!).  Relax, enjoy the scenery - gorgeous forests and tons of wild birds all around the cabin.  We had a great time!

Safe at Anchor is an exquisite piece of paradise! Aside from hoping for better signage to turn left onto Cameron Road; heading south on Hwy. 1, â€” resulting in my getting lost and delaying my arrival â€” my stay was phenomenal! The online description of the cabin was right on the mark. The kitchen is well equipped and I relished the owners' impressive book and CD collections. It is a perfect place for one seeking peace, introspection and restoration. I am curious about the history of the cabin. I noted the owners' stacks of Architectural Digest, and then was struck by a framed tribute to David Parker Clayton, as that's my mother's maiden name. I looked him up when I returned home and learned he was an abstract artist and architect, having designed several homes in Mendocino. Any further insights about him would be much appreciated!

In gratitude,

Jennifer

We were very happily surprised that everything is just as advertised, which doesn't always happen when renting vacation houses.  But a new couch is needed ASAP. Those cushions are pretty sad.  No problems connecting with WiFi and a huge TV with DISH in every bedroom if that's what you want.  Two thumbs up from us.

We had a great weekend getaway with our two adult sons and our dog. Everything was right there, including a fabulous view and the feeling of being in a secluded treehouse. What a wonderful way to escape the heat of the northern California valley in the summer. Everything we wanted to do was close enough, but we were equally happy just to be in this beautiful location. Best family trip in years.

We had a wonderful experience and didn't want to leave at the end of the week.  We hope to be able to come back for another stay in the not to distant future.  If you love the northern beaches, ocean, coastal scenerey, mountains, rivers, and the forest (the Red Woods are amazing) like we do you couldn't ask for a better place to stay than Safe At Anchor.  Only one small suggestion would be that the couch cushions have pretty much done their job, over time, and when the both of us were sitting on it, the edge of the front board was very hard and started putting your legs to sleep.  It did not take away from our experience but if I were king for a day - a new couch would be in order.  We did not sleep in the lower floor bed room but the bed in the main floor bedroom was soooo nice and comfortable - it was very tempting to put it in the truck and take it home to Utah.

We had a wonderful stay at Safe at Anchor!!

Very near the dunes and beach. May want to bring some bath towels for your family. Easy access to Hwy 1. Had to buy a basketball left it there. Brought chairs to sit around water fountain. All in All a very nice place. Be careful regarding the bathroom in the laundry room no door to close for privacy.

We come to Fort Bragg every year for the 4th of July holiday weekend. This is our first house rental here. We enjoyed the location and the spacious house and we will probably rent a house again because we liked the ability for all of us to sit around playing games, etc. .

We had an excellent stay at Cleone Bliss. There were 6 adults, five children and a dog in our party and each one of us agreed it was an excellent weekend! Clean Bliss is as clean and tidy as can be. The home is clearly freshly remodeled and meticulously maintained. The master bathrooms are wonderful~ as well as the suites themselves. There is a small room with bunkbeds that became  a great hideout for the kids. The yard was large and became the perfect spot for water gun fights. Every night we walked to the beach a mere 10 minutes way and watched spectacular sunsets. MacKerricher state park is right next door with great hikes and lush trails. The house itself offered many helpful amenities for cooking at home for a large group and there is also a wonderful gas grill available. The beds were comfortable, the spaces roomy, and access to fun is a stones throw away!

House was perfect and Vacasa was a pleasure to deal with. We thank them much!

The property is well equipped with anything I could have used and had entertainment for all ages...this is a great vacation rental

Big enough for a family of 8. Nice back yard fire pit. Not much of a view at all of ocean. Plenty of blankets, towels and amenities in the home. The house was clean. We did enjoy ourselves.
#Pathname:/usa/California/Elk/
One of the smallest towns along the Mendocino coast, little Elk, California is nonetheless big on appeal. A little more quiet and peaceful than its better-known neighboring towns to the north, a stay in one of our Mendocino coast vacation rentals in Elk offers sweeping views and natural splendor along with true relaxation.

Despite its diminutive size, Elk offers some lovely dining options for its lucky visitors. Queenie's Roadhouse Cafe has legendary eggs Benedict, and pub food doesn't get much better than at Bridget Dolan's. For a really unique experience, head up the bluff to the firehouse/dive bar (yes, really) Beacon Light by the Sea for a few laid-back beers and a lot of interesting conversation from the affable owner.

Anything else you might need is within easy reach in the larger towns of Mendocino or Fort Bragg to the north. Of course, the real draw is the coast itself. Rugged cliffs, sweeping vistas, and picturesque sea stacks make this stretch of shoreline a photographer's dream. To get a little closer to the beauty, take an ocean kayak tour, or plan a horseback ride along the beach.

Just north of town is the gorgeous Navarro River Redwoods State Park, a must-visit for a scenic hike under a canopy of old-growth trees. And after a long day of exploration, book a massage at a local spa for a well-deserved treat! From luxurious escapes to adventure-packed weekends, our Mendocino vacation rentals in beautiful, charming Elk guarantee an experience you'll never forget.

This oceanfront three-bedroom, three bath Mendocino vacation rental home is the perfect setting for kicking back with friends and family, enjoying a glass of wine on the patio and watching the waves roll in. This home sets up on a bluff, which allows for a fantastic view.  Set back from the edge of the ocean so one can observe varied wildlife grazing with the Pacific sunset as a backdrop you and five other guests will love every minute spent at Sunset Point!

Centrally located, you'll be a short drive to either Fort Bragg or Mendocino Village. Take a quick walk to the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens for a truly floral experience and gorgeous ocean backdrop.

Ocean focused and single level, almost every room in this relaxed open floor-plan home is designed to maximize beach views. A large westward facing deck, living room windows and a telescope in the living room and sound dock allows for endless hours of whale watching, storm surveillance and sunset soirees.

The viewing room is a masterpiece, with oceanfront full windows, a large persian rug framed by an ocean-facing sofa and plush swivel chairs to choose whether to take in the ocean views or participate in what's happening indoors. Victorian inspired patterns and designs lead you into the second sitting area, again with full ocean views, two sofas in front of a TV with DVD player and a wood-burning stove.

Drift into the updated gourmet-sized kitchen for a casual lunch, or utilize the fully stocked appliances and equipment for a formal evening seating. Granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, light wooden cabinetry and an ocean view are sure to inspire a sincerely Pacific culinary creation!

Two king suites each have unique features - one has a luxurious, almost decadent ocean view bathroom with a Jacuzzi for two & a separate walk-in shower with dual showerheads; the other has sliding doors to a private deck with ocean views. The queen bedroom has views of the front garden. The family/entertainment room is a separate cozy room with a sleeper sofa; a great room for games, watching TV or using your laptop on the home's WIFI. Up to six people will find the varying room layout a perfect design for traveling couples, families and friends!

Fully embrace your settings with a few nights spent playing in the large backyard, or impress your group with fresh lobster barbecued on the gas grill, and finish off sipping a famous local wine while lounging in the patio furniture. Speaking of outdoor amenities, parking is a dream as this home features three spaces outside of the garage!

The Fort Bragg and Mendocino area offers a wide array of outdoor, nautical themed activities as well as classic Northern California culture. Spend the whole day under the sun visiting parks like the Otis Johnson Wilderness Park within city limits, Pomo Bluffs Park along the headlands overlooking the Noyo inlet, and MacKerricher State Park with miles of sandy beaches. Or take a trip to the amazing Glass Beach, world famous for its natural recycling and polishing process of dumped glass. Keep up the activity with a horseback ride down the beach, sea kayaking, or wild edible mushroom tour! Looking for a more leisurely experience? Take a ride on the acclaimed Skunk Train, schedule a wine tour through the array of local vineyards, or settle down for lunch at Laurel's Deli in the Depot shopping mall - known for it's yummy fresh-made desserts!

A wonderful home for adult couples, friends and families of up to six looking to leave the maddening bustle of the city behind! You will find all you were looking for and more with this Northern California oceanfront getaway.

Peaceful, secluded, scenic. This is a great getaway. Lots of outside space to play and enjoy. We will definitely be back.

Was beautiful property, with wonderful view.

Close to Mendocino & Ft Bragg.

This was my first time renting a place with Vacasa and I was very happy with the service.  After booking the rental house, I had a question about my confirmation email which was quickly taken care of.  I also asked about the phone at the house since there was a bad review about that.  The person I talked to said they would check on it and call me back.  Within the hour they called me back with the information I requested.

Our family thought the house was great (there's 4 of us).  It is very spacious and has just about everything you need.  It looks just like the pictures advertised.

I was a little hesitant to book this house after reading one review but pretty much everything turned out to be fine.  So I'm going to address those things written in the other review for anyone concerned:

The phone - we could call out locally, there was no code needed.

The view - we could see the beach perfectly fine from the house - The shrubs don't interfere from the view unless you're looking to the right from the house.

Wifi - it was a little slow but worked just fine

Cell service - if you have AT&T it's hard to get service anywhere in Fort Bragg - it's not the house.

The windows - they were clean and most of them had screens

Patio Chairs - there were 4 plastic adronik chairs

Jacuzzi - we were able to fill it up with hot water.

Stocked kitchen - we didn't cook much but it seemed to have all the basics.   The only thing I couldn't find was a tea kettle.

Overall, I think this place is a good value for what you get.  Our family is already talking about planning another trip here next year!

This is a home, not a hotel room.  It's warm, welcoming, and very comfortable. The toughest part was having to leave.  I can't wait to return! Soon!

The home we rented had one of the most beautiful views on the coast.  Huge lot and very secluded.  Perfect sunsets!

This house was a great place for our family to enjoy time together. This house was beautiful, and there was plenty of torn for us to enjoy ourselves without feeling like we were on top of each other. We can't wait to go back again!

Excellent place and location. We really enjoyed our stay.

A very spacious and lovely home right on the Mendocino Coast. Secluded yet five minutes to Fort  Bragg.  Perfect for three couples.  A place you will want to return to.

This is a gem, right on the ocean with the Botanical gardens on one side.  Home is comfortable to accommodate 6.  Would return again

We have rented many many homes along the mendo coast over 30 years. We know rental properties are hard to keep up. Renters of THIS house should be aware of  the following however.

PHONE SERVICE- There is virtually NONE. There is no cell service (ATT and Verizon really dont work) and get this!,  NO house phone service either. This house requires a code to call out. YET- no one knows the code - The manual at the house gives NO explanation on what code to use and when we sent the issue via email to the rental agency they did not provide a solution either. We could not even CALL THE RENTAL agency - because you cant use the phone without the code. The listed details on the house (before you rent) does not warn you of this issue so it was a HUGE setback for us. Imagine you have to get in your car and drive to main highway to merely make a phone call to your home or office a mere 40 miles away. For $400+ a night most people would expect to be able to make a basic call out, OR be told HOW TO DO SO in the manual. No luck at this house.

OTHER ISSUES to be aware of. WIFI only works if you are really close to router and is super slow. Many window screens are missing so if you want to open a window- prepare for insects or worse. You cannot really hear the ocean from inside the house as this house is pretty far back from cliff.  Views are nice but windows are way dirty and many windows are blocked by hedges to fully see the ocean. Kitchen is not as advertised i.e. well stocked for cooking. Lids donâ€™t fit pans, very few pans etc. Most cupboards are empty.

Yes it has a jucuzzi in master bath- however- the water heater is so small, that you cannot fill the tub more than about 18 inches before hot water runs out. Kind of defeats the purpose of a tub when you can't even come close to filling it.

There is a deck but no outside chairs for it. There are other things odd about the house but  are merely aesthetics and might be fine for others. Owners of this house should re-invest some money to make it work for a modern renter.

We have used Vacasa twice now in the last 6 months! We have been pleased with the rentals and the rental process both times. The homes are clean and tidy and everything in states that they are. We will surely look for rentals from Vacasa in the future!!

This was a fabulous rental home.  Comfortable, spacious and in a great location.  We were overwhelmed with the accommodations.  Internet did not work well but we also were trying to contact the provider on holiday time so that may be the reason.  Had to go buy shampoo but had to buy groceries anyway.  Really no complaints, only thank you for a great family experience.

This a beautiful house and grounds.  We saw deer , jays, other birds and squirrels.  A hot tub would be wonderful.  Kitchen and appliances were high end and easy to use.  We would consider coming again.

Very  nice home with a lot of beautiful scenery.  Excellent place to get away for a week or longer.

Watch the ocean from a wall of windows

This newly remodeled Fort Bragg vacation rental boasts a private oceanfront parcel, as well and unique foliage and wildlife. It's the perfect getaway for anyone looking to be soothed by the beautiful sounds of the ocean - especially from the private hot tub on the deck!

Just north of the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens and near Digger Creek, this home's not far from the action. Downtown Fort Bragg is a stone's throw away, as are the other charming hamlets along the coast.

An all-redwood interior and numerous picture windows make this a highly desirable vacation residence; spend hours watching the waterfront panorama as you let your tensions melt away.

This large ranch abode is sure to delight. The vaulted ceilings and open floor plan make the already expansive space feel even more spacious. The living area features a cream carpet, two gray sofas, and wooden chairs. Red pillows add a splash of color. A gas fireplace is the focal point, and occupies a space near the flatscreen TV and a wall festooned with duck artwork.

The modern kitchen is a gourmand's delight with a massive island, dishwasher, black cupboards, fridge and matching electric range. There are plenty of kitchen accoutrements to whip up a chef-worthy repast in no time. Craft a delicious breakfast and serve it at the four-seat breakfast bar, or dine on a larger meal at the four-seat table overlooking the ocean.

The bedrooms are on the main floor, just steps away from the living area. The master features a king bed, small wooden dresser, and an ocean vista view. Another king bed occupies a smaller bedroom, and a third bedroom has a queen bedroom adorned with the same floral coverlet. The bright yellow bathroom offers a vista to the private backyard.

Head down the wooden steps to gaze at the beautiful Pacific Ocean. A new deck runs the length of the house, with a private hot tub that takes excellent advantage of the whitewater vistas. You'll be able to stay well-connected as this home comes with WiFi.

Once a collection of sleepy fishing villages, the Mendocino Coast now boasts myriad food and adventure activities. Enjoy touring the Victorian homes in historic Mendocino Village. Try your hand at kayaking via Liquid Fusion Kayaking in Fort Bragg, or spend a rainy day at the Triangle Tattoo and Museum, showcasing Maori tattoo art from the 1800s. The Mendo Bistro in Fort Bragg serves up barbecued splendor throughout the year, and craft beer aficionados will love the opportunity to sip a microbrew at North Coast Brewing Company.

Whatever your pleasure, a stay at this gorgeous, updated oceanfront Northern California vacation rental is sure to be a delight!

The Tideaway is a wonderful beach home where you can relax and enjoy amazing No. Cal sights and sounds. I don't think the photos on VRBO do it justice. When we entered everyone in our family let out a squeal of delight. Every room has a fantastic view of the ocean.  There are two little private beaches in the backyard with tide pools that  provide hours of entertainment. The hike down to them is quite steep so it may not be great for young children. Every room was spacious and the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to do all of our cooking at home. We will definitely return someday.

We were so very pleased with our stay! We saw dolphins and whales while we were relaxing in the back yard. We didn't have to leave the house, everything we wanted was right there. Waking up in the morning was such a treat, opening your eyes while still laying in bed and having an amazing view of the ocean was incredible. Can't wait to stay again!

Chris & Nicole McHenry

This place is great! From the spacious rooms and common space, to the hot tub, to the gorgeous surroundings...we were all quite happy to have landed in this spot for our time in Ft. Bragg. I would love to stay here again!

My husband and I took our disabled adult son on a quick weekend getaway.  My son who is 29 with severe autism loved the kitchen and cooked for us for 2 days.  He keeps asking when can we go back!  Beautiful and relaxing.

Our kids loved exploring and sleeping with the windows open. The view was incredible and my husband loves searching for whales through the telescope.

Lovely home, beautiful views, pleasant staff. Will definitely stay here again in spite of issues with deck. Hope it gets replaced soon.

This home was perfect for our extended family - the 5 kids loved their large room (with a pool table!), and the 6 adults spread out around the 3 sitting areas and large kitchen.  But the view - stunning!!, and the location - wow!  Elk is a cute little town, pub next door was handy, easy walk to the beach + the elk grocery was very well stocked with local items.  The views from the lawn cannot be oversold

Awesome yard! Unique proposition because of its close proximity to restaurants, pub, market, etc...

this was a wonderful property... i hadn't had a vacation in ~5 years and this exceeded by expectations. the view was breathtaking. i left refreshed and renewed. i have aleady referred two people from my office after seeing the picture.  thank you and on such short notice...  We are planning to go back asap..

This is a beautiful property and location. Home is perfect for multi-family vacation and we will definitely be returning!

Very comfortable home for a large group - kids room holds 8 and is a perfect hang out spot ( our girls loved  it)

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

Best part of house: private view of the ocean from the backyard.  The photos don't do it justice, but a short walk in the backyard, leads to your own private bluff with views of the ocean.  There is a bench at the edge of the bluff where we would sit at for hours and even had wine and cheese there one night.  We would do yoga on the lawn overlooking to ocean.  Dinners were had on the backyard deck with the ocean views.  And of course, the hot tub is outside in the backyard with the breathtaking view.

The second best part of the house is the well stocked kitchen and range.  We cooked all of our meals in.

The bedrooms were cozy, plentiful.  Bonus features include the klipsch stero in the living, the pool table up stairs.  Also other things like video games, sat tv.

The wifi was weak and there was no cell service  (tmobile)- but that was ok for us as we really wanted to disconnect from the world.

We would recommend rental to all just for the view.  But the house itself is fantastic (well furnished, cleaned, maintened) It is a big house and would suit a family well or a 3-4 couples.  It was just me and my friend, we liked have all the space to spread out.

This Fort Bragg vacation rental is so close to the surf, you may just be able to feel the ocean spray from the back deck! Add to that a private hot tub overlooking the ocean, a cozy interior, and a great location just south of downtown Fort Bragg and you'll see why this Northern California Coast getaway is a hidden gem along the rocky shore.

This well-designed, 300 square foot studio, attached to a larger home but devoted to your exclusive use during your stay, is big on amenities, even though its layout is compact. From practically every window you'll have a gorgeous view of the ocean. In the evenings, relax on the comfortable sofa, while you watch cable TV or a DVD, or you may just want to snuggle and enjoy the view.

Out on the deck, you'll have a charcoal grill for cookouts, as well as a private hot tub. And if the weather is stormy, just stay inside and watch the dramatic show from the warmth of your Marebello retreat.

Hungry? Head to the full kitchen to whip up a meal - you'll have a refrigerator, stovetop/oven, microwave, and other gadgets for everything from heating up leftovers to making a vacation feast. There's even a two-seat bistro table for enjoying your creations. There is no dishwasher, but you can always let the dishes soak while you walk down to the shore and explore the tide pools.

This Fort Bragg vacation studio has a four-poster queen sized bed and a full bathroom with a shower. You'll also have a stereo if you want to listen to music. Perfect for up to two guests, Marebello makes a wonderfully romantic retreat or an ideal and quiet Fort Bragg getaway for one.

From here, you are less than a block away from one of the nicest attractions on the Northern California Coast - the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens. Hike along beautiful trails, bird watch, and learn about coastal ecosystems and their flora and fauna. Other nearby attractions include downtown Fort Bragg, only three miles to the north. Here you can wander shops and galleries, and when you work up an appetite stop in at North Coast Brewing for pints of Blue Star Wheat Beer and garlic fries.

This location is also very convenient for visiting the postcard-perfect community of Mendocino, just eight miles to the south. Hike along the bluff  at the Mendocino Headlands State Park, browse for books at the Mendocino Book Company, or just sightsee around this quaint oceanside village.

Your stay at this Northern California vacation rental will be so pleasant and charming, that you may not want to leave! Spend lazy afternoons wandering through coastal gardens, exploring tide pools down at the rocky beach below your deck, and in the evenings, relax in the hot tub while you take in a spectacular sunset.

My husband and I had a wonderful 2 nights in this cozy rental. The location is breathtaking and extremely private with a private road.  Would only recommend this rental for a romantic adult getaway like ours. It was perfect.

This is the best vacation we have had ever.  This rental is clean and has the best view one can imagine.  It has everything thing you need from appliances, coffee maker, dishes, bathroom supplies and BBQ.  The outdoor spa makes the entire trip worth every penny.  This place is ideal for a couple for a great getaway.  Please don't bring children, it will only take away from the experience of the peacefulness.  This is the only place I would ever want to rent in the Fort Bragg area.

We have stayed in several places over the years as we have visited the Mendocino, Fort Bragg area. This is one of our favorites. It is small and  cozy, very clean. As you enter the cottage, you are OVERWHELMED by the amazing closeness of the ocean. Breathtaking! We found it to be reasonably priced, especially in the off season. The kitchen is small so we thought only sufficient for smaller meal preparation.

I only suggest that a new cover be put on the hot tub since the cover on there now is cracked and brittle making it hard to take on and off.  The house was great the hot tub awesome and the ocean majestic.

This place was truly stunning!  We arrived there and could not get over the view and feel of the ocean. We watched every sunset, right outside the back porch. We were mesmerized by the views.  You can feel the mist of the ocean spraying you.  You don't even need to leave the house.  Pack your food, beverages and belonging and stay in heaven!!  We have been visiting Fort Bragg for about 13 years and will ONLY stay at The Marebello from now on!  We are in love with this beautiful little place!!

a little slice of heaven!...right on the ocean!...loved it!...we sat out a storm and watched and listened to the ocean from the bed...the bed is positioned in such a way that the ocean is your big screen tv...we are definitely coming back in the future...enjoy if you decide to visit this place~

This was our first stay here and i was nervous because it looks like you might be right next to someone else, turns out it was completely secluded and very private. We stayed here for our honeymoon and loved it so much we tried to extend our trip for one more day but it was already booked :( Waking up with the love of my life and the ocean every morning!!! The pictures do not do it justice, i did not want to leave the property, we did leave however to eat, get massages (bamboo gardens), and of course shop!! Relaxing in the hot tub and enjoying the view was enough for us!!! We will definitely be back next year for our anniversary!

It was a beautiful, romantic get away, my head and my heart are still there. Thank you! Rick Clark

We spent 6 days at this rental. It was neat, clean and VERY comfortable. The quality of the bed and linens made it extra nice.  But the view was beyond breathtaking. What an incredible  experience.

We were greeted by a doe and her fawn grazing around the drive area.  We found Marebello to be charming and just the right size of us.  I paint and the view was spectacular.  My husband fishes and caught five, lost a big one.  He was happy!   We will return!

My husband and I visited here 4 times 18 yeaqrs ago. It has always stayed in both our memories as a place we wished to return to...but somewhere over time we lost our contact to rent the Marebella.

When looking for a place in the Fort Bragg/Mendiocino area for a short getaway I saw the fence and ocean picture and knew just from that that I found the Marebella and booked immediately.

Not much has changed.  It's as lovely and romantic as it was all those years ago.

It's been updated and you can no longer excess the tide pools from the stairs that have perhaps washed away with time.

It still remains in our hearts our favorite go to spot just for us.  We will be back.

great place, very private.  you can walk to the botanical, only 1 1/2 miles to town - very nice location.  we returned to chico yesterday and we have already recommended this rental to several people.

We came to Marebello for my husband's birthday and we couldn't have booked a better location. This unit is extremely private and has the most beautiful views. Even with a very cloudy day, it was still amazing. We will definitely be returning in the future.

We were so happy with our stay here.  It was as if we had the whole ocean to ourselves.  I sat in the hot tub and stared at the waves and sunsets so long that I pruned up.  We would gladly come back to this beach home.  We even saw a whale and some seals on our last day!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this property, as it was attached to a house. It may as well have been a stand-alone cottage. The privacy was super, especially compared to staying in a hotel. We may never stay at the Beachcomber again, and for the price this is a better deal.

The only issue we had was the hot water heater tripping off a couple times. The property Manager was quick to resolve the problem and it was only a minor inconvenience. Everything else was perfect for our needs.

The property is a perfect little studio for two people. We spent a lot of time on the deck, when the weather allowed. We never did get a chance to use the hot tub, but we'll make that a top priority on the next visit. We'll certainly stay here again.

This was one of the best vacations we have ever been on - the serenity of the ocean and the peacefulness was amazing.  we truly didn't want to leave.  You can't beat the ocean waves crashing down and the wildlife - we awoke to does and bucks every morning and night.  the home was perfect - just what we needed and clean!  the hot tub a huge bonus - We cant say enough good things about this property and we will be back next year for sure!

This location is a wonderful place to relax, relax, relax........ listen to the ocean, ocean,ocean...and..........

MAREBELLO HAS OFFICIALLY CAPTURED OUR HEARTS AND MEMORIES. I CANT WAIT TO RETURN TO THIS MAGICAL PLACE TO NJOY MORE MEMORIES. GREAT PLACE ALL AROUND. AWSOME FOR COUPLES AND GREAT FOR SINGLES. WILL PROVIDE A GREAT AMOUNT OF MENTAL CLARITY. WE WERE WOWED FROM THE MOMENT WE ENTERED AND WAS SO SAD TO LEAVE AND SO WILL YOU...MAKE SURE YOU GET UP THERE DURING THE DAYLIGHT CAN BE A LITTLE HARD FINDING DURING THE NIGHT BESIDES THAT WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND...

THANK YOU VACASA AS WELL AS THE OWNER FOR THE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AND LASTING MEMORIES...

Great place, very relaxing, close to everything but very quiet. All you hear is the ocean.

We will for sure come back again. So relaxing. Loved it!

With the sound of the ocean crashing on the rocks and the magnificent sunsets, we were swept away to a place of Zen creativity and peace.  Thank you ever so much for sharing your Paradise.   TC & Frankie   ;o)

Great spot in between tall trees and on the cliffside, the water is right below the deck. Great view, hot tub looks out over the water.  I'd be afraid to have kids there though due to the proximity to the cliff, it does have a small fence.

This is the perfect spot for an anniversary or other special occasion. My husband and I had a wonderful time and will be back.

We were wowed by the view, but can't really get down to the water. The property is beautiful, perfect for two. However, it is attached to another larger house, and there is another property nearby. We were the only ones there, so it seemed very private. Might not be quite so private if other properties are occupied.

What a fabulous place to celebrate any special occasion!  We loved being able to sit in the hot tub and watch spectacular sunsets.  The location and privacy, the waves crashing literally feet away, being visited by deer, the comfy bed, all made for one of our best three-day getaways!

We WILL be here next year!

This was the most beautiful, comfortable and romantic place I have ever seen.We will be back.

With wheelchair accessibility, a private hot tub, and pet-friendly attitude, you will feel right at home here!

Situated about seven miles north of Fort Bragg, this home is right next to the beautiful sand dunes. The beach is just past the dunes, about half a mile, though the walk is a bit of a hike - drive just south to MacKerricher State Park for easy beach access and amazing views of the ocean and dunes.

This two-bedroom, one-bathroom wheelchair-accessible home can accommodate up to six guests, and you are even welcome to bring your beloved pets with you, though a $10 per pet, per day, $40 minimum fee per stay does apply.

Outside, you will be pleased to find a nice deck with seating, a firepit, and a private hot tub! You and your guests will love using the firepit to cook up s'mores for dessert, or relaxing in the cozy warmth of the hot tub.

The Distant Shores would be a great place to enjoy a nice vacation with your family or a few close friends, though you could also rent it with the other three cabins in the complex and bring a large group to vacation together! With Fort Bragg just a few miles down the highway, take a quick trip into the city for a nice meal at a restaurant, some groceries, or to explore the town.

The Dune Flower, one of four cabins in the Mendocino Coast Dunes Retreat complex, is a great place for a small group to stay, though it can also be rented together with the other three houses for a fun-filled group vacation! This cabin has a charming nautical theme, a clean and comfortable design, and a pet-friendly attitude, so everyone will love it here!

Located about seven miles north of Fort Bragg, this home is just over half a mile from the sparkling ocean, though if you want easy beach access you may want to drive to MacKerricher State Park, because the walk from the cabin over the dunes is a bit hilly.

Up to four people are may stay in this one-bedroom, one-bathroom home which features a full-size bed in the bedroom and a comfortable fold-out futon. Feel free to bring your dogs to enjoy the vacation with you, though a $10 per pet, nightly, $40 minimum fee per stay applies.

With a delightful nautical theme, you will feel very welcome in the living area, which comes complete with cable TV, a DVD player, Internet access, and a cozy gas fireplace. A kitchenette has a hot plate and a mini fridge so you can whip up a snack easily.

In the grassy backyard area, privacy fencing will keep you separate from the other cabins. A nice deck area with seating and a firepit nearby is a great place to sit in the evening, telling stories, relaxing in the cool sea air, and roasting a few marshmallows on the fire.

This cabin would be a lovely place for a small family or a few friends to spend a nice vacation, though it would also be wonderful to rent all four cabins at the same time and invite all your loved ones! With the beach nearby, the beauty of nature surrounding you, and towns within a short drive away, you may never want to leave.

With a fun theme, this ship-shape cabin is a comfortable place to stay during your vacation!

I stayed with my mother, boyfriend, and two dogs in May and we all had a great time!  If you plan to spend a lot of time in the house, it is a little crowded with more than two people, but we were out most of the time so it was no problem for us.  There isn't an oven and the fridge is a mini-fridge but there is a two burner hot plate and the grill outside is great, if you plan on doing any cooking.  The location is about 10 minutes north of Fort Bragg, which was great for us.  Very quiet and peaceful.  Very clean, plenty of towels and bedding.  Would definitely stay here again!

It was quiet enriching stay. I was impressed with a blend of coziness and efficiency.

They anticipated all of potential needs

The furnishings were lovely, and the whitewashed walls are very pretty. The location is wonderfully quiet, we could enjoy every bird call and since our home is in a very dog oriented (read: barking night and day) neighborhood, the silence was so restful.

Loved walking the dunes and beach, could have really gotten in shape had we stayed a week instead of two nights.

A lovely cabin in a quiet location,  on the edge if beautiful dunes. It feels remote, though very close to Fort Bragg and Mendocino. I would definitely return there .

We loved it from the moment we pulled up. So clean, beautiful and inviting. We loved the fact that we could cook in the kitchen and still eat outside by the camp fire. Our kids had a blast being able to explore the trail leading to the beach.  I would recommend this to other families.  It is small and very cozy, but very comfortable. The bed is quite small for for someone that is over 6 ft tall like my husband but we made it work! It was definitely worth getting away to this cute cozy cottage nestled in the woods. It would be great for couples or families with kids!

We very much needed a relaxing getaway and this house gave it to us. Great location, not that far from Fort Bragg. Very quiet and had a great area for me to play catch with my son.

It may not be on the beach, but it is close enough for a good ocean feeling. We absolutely loved the interior decorations. It was a very fun place for us to spend a few days.

Comfortable enough, but if you're looking for great amenities, this isn't the place.  Beach access was overstated - don't plan on using it for your primary ocean visits and dogs are not allowed on that path or beach.  Vacasa seems to have far better properties.

This property was absolutely amazing. I have one and only one complaint. There was no handbook explaining anything about the property. Ie, no WiFi password no location of the stove and rules or requests for when we leave.  but overall it was a very wonderful place. I highly recommend it.

Family vacation with our daughters and their families, great location close to several beaches- short drive, great yard for kids, had fun playing croquet, loved the fire pit for smores. Would defintely book again.

We have a large family with kids in there twenties that are married with some grandkids..

This place is great.. the ocean is a pretty far walk through the dunes but you end up on a perfect private length of lower ten mile beach. Very family friendly place..

There was plenty of everything, and the layout of the houses was great.  We had many cooks lending hands and opinions, and the kitchen was fabulous for this.  There is some furniture that we moved because it's dangerous to small children:  i.e. a coffee table with a thick glass top.

This place was private, despite being right next to another rental property.  The entrance was behind a garage and was fenced off with lattice.  There was an area off the back that was latticed in with grass that was perfect for letting the doggies do their duty.  It was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed the fire pit!  The kids loved climbing and running down the sand dunes that were a short walk down the private road.  There were several things that didn't work (hot tub, DVD player, outside lights) and there were only 3 bath towels in a place that advertises 4-6 people (we had 4 so the kids had to share).  All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would choose this location again.

Nice property close to the dunes and ocean

We had a great Thanksgiving holiday at this property.  The location and the views from the house, hot tub are awesome.

Sky Song is a lovely house with a fantastic view, especially from the hot tub. We enjoyed hiking in the Pygmy Forest, looking at the many wild mushrooms, strolling on the beach and sitting in the hot tub at night with they sky full of stars and the sound of frogs nearby. I highly recommend Sky Song but would advise bringing all your own household items (dish soap, paper towels, garbage bags...) since there is little or none available in the house.

Sky song was the perfect place for  family getaway! It's just 2 minutes off hwy 1, very easy to find, even on a very dark, stormy night lol!

Bedrooms were adequate, comfortable beds, nice living area with gorgeous large windows and an amazing view of the river and ocean on sunny days.

If you're planning on using  kitchen to cook meals in, they did not have one spice, not even salt and pepper, this was disappointing as we love to cook and were hoping to have even just the basics such as salt pepper and garlic.

Also the phone service didn't work, there was plenty in phones in living room, and bedrooms but no service, and with no cell reception, if we were to have an emergency we would have been in trouble.

Also, house was listed for sale on the market, that was surprising to see real estate sign in yard, that should have been disclosed at time of reservation.

Spa was incredible, nice and hot, working jets, and a beautiful view to where the river meets the sea!

The whole stay was very relaxing and stress free. The home and the view are even more gorgeous than what you see in pictures. The only caveat is "no cell phones; no internet". You need a calling card to make a long distance call from the land line!  I loved the experience, because it was like old times when family had a chance to talk and bond instead of texting or internet surfing.

There is a convenience store nearly 4 miles away and the stuff there is expensive. Its a good idea to go fully stocked or drive down to Mendocino or Fort Bragg to fill up on groceries, gas.

Pet-friendly home with access to pools, hot tub, and more!

This is a classic Meadow House vacation home in Sunriver, a family-friendly resort community that boasts world-class golf courses, hiking and biking trails, and year-round activities. 17 Meadow House is the lower level of a duplex in the highly sought after Meadows area near golf courses, the SHARC aquatic center, and the fun-filled Village. Having had only one owner since it was built, this home has been very well maintained. Cozy and all on one level, it's the perfect place for a family or group of friends to get away from it all and have the ultimate Sunriver adventure!

The exterior boasts two private decks, one enclosed for privacy and one that views a lovely green area out the back. Spend lazy summer days out on the deck, just sitting back, relaxing, and enjoying the peace and quiet. Inside, it's just as serene, with vaulted wood ceilings, a large wood-burning fireplace, and comfortable furnishings that will thoroughly charm you and your group. Enjoy time with family and friends after an action-filled day of golfing, floating the river, or having fun at SHARC.

There's a large flatscreen TV with cable and a DVD player in the living room for movie nights and plenty of room for everyone to find their favorite spot. On chilly high desert evenings, a favorite activity may well be just hanging out together in front of a toasty fire, playing board games and talking about the day's adventures.

A full kitchen has everything needed to make meals and snacks. Whether it's coffee and biscuits and gravy in the morning or a giant spinach salad for a light dinner, you'll have it all covered. There's even a gas grill on the deck for barbecues on nice evenings. And with both and outdoor and indoor seating areas, you can dine indoors or al fresco style out on the deck.

There are two large bedrooms - one has a queen sized bed, flat screen TV, comfy reclining chair, and a door out to a deck. The second bedroom has two twin beds and large floor to ceiling windows for a nice view of the surrounding greenery. There is also a sleeper sofa in the main room, which allows up to six people plenty of room to stretch out and relax.

There was a musty smell upon entering at first. The furniture was OK, but could use an upgrade. Pet friendly so there are always going to be some stains or smells. Overall not a bad stay. There fees almost doubled the price though.

Spacious, and clean this two bedroom, two bathroom condo is close to everything Sunriver has to offer. Quiet street close to paths and the meadow.

Nice experience and Sunriver is great.  The place was spacious and clean.  Bed in master was not very comfortable.   Good pet accommodations.

There are few properties that allow dogs, so beggars can't be choosers.  That said, this property is in dire need of some updating.

We really enjoyed our stay at 17 Meadow House. The location simply cannot be beat - centrally located within easy walking distance of the Village and the SHARC, and great views to Mt. Bachelor across the meadow are only a few minutes away as well. The bikes in storage were an unexpected plus, though there was only one suitable for an adult.

The beds were comfortable for our family of five, and there is tons of space. The kitchen is smaller but worked well for us. There is lots of comfy seating and we watched several movies with the DVD player and new LCD TV.

A few things could use updating or fixing but everything was very clean.  I loved having a ground floor unit all on one level.

We thought the location was perfect--close to the village while still being far enough that it was very quiet. The back patio was well suited for us to relax and drink coffee on in the mornings (it opens up to a large open grassy area). The furnishings inside were a bit outdated but it didn't really bother us because they were still quite comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed and we didn't have any problems with appliances or anything else. A few areas of the house could use a bit more light, but there are plenty of large windows to allow some natural light to come in through the trees.

Head to the market to pick up groceries for the night's meal, or take some time to wander around the shops. Peruse contemporary art at Artist's Gallery Sunriver, pick up a new best-seller at Sunriver Books and Music, or get an old fashioned ice cream treat at Goody's soda fountain.

This was our family's first trip to Sunriver.  It is beautiful!  Everyone in our group had a wonderful time from teens through grandparents.  This house is very nice and accomodating for families. Everything we needed was either there or easily accessible.  We are planning to come back again!

This house accommodated 3 small families wonderfully with 3 Kings, a bunk room, 3 bathrooms and 2 living rooms.  The SHARC passes are great, of course, and there is a hot tub and fireplace on site.  We will be back to this house!

We just experienced the loss of  my husband's mom earlier this month so getting us all together for a relaxing time just for fun was very healing. Your accommodations made it possible for us to remember the fun memories we had with our beloved grandma and to make new memories as well. thanks!

We had two families with 5 total children and this house fit us PERFECTLY!  The separate family and living rooms were great and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed to feed a large group.  The bikes were in good shape and we had a great time relaxing in the hot tub enjoying the beautiful fall weather in Sunriver.  The location of the house is on the north side of the resort and is a bit of a ride to get to the SHARC, the village, or down to the river, but wasn't too difficult for the younger riders.  All in all a great experience!

We had such a great time and we look forward to coming again.

House is exactly as shown in pictures!  Enjoyed our stay and having Vacasa available to call was a great benefit!  Property Manager that came by was super nice too!  Great house!

This home was perfect for our Spring ski trip.  Location to both the mountain and Bend were perfect.  We loved the Sunriver community as well.  The house was a perfect size for the 5 Adults and 2 kids in our party.  The kids enjoyed the toys and the adults loved having that extra family room for the kids to take over.  The house had all the things we needed.  Except maybe a blender for after a great day on the slopes :)  And the grocery store right behind the house was so convenient.  We would definitely stay here again.  Looking forward to scheduling  a trip during the summer so we can enjoy the SAHRC complex.

My mother,  sister,  and or families stayed in this lovely home over thanksgiving.  The kids room and second living room was perfect for both the older and younger kids. The hot tub was enjoyed while drinking hot cider too. The kitchen and dining table was perfect for our thanksgiving dinner. We enjoying biking the trails and taking walks.  We will definitely stay again.  Perfect location and perfect family home! !

The Lassen House was great, would work out great for large families, great location away from the crowds

I thought we had access to the north pool . Not sure I'd go back to sun River due to extreme crowd at SHARC . Also no bike access. Rather stay in Bend more to do

The only thing that was not good were the bikes. Sunriver has lots of trails and ther were only 2 working bikes. I will make sure next time i stay in sunriver the placd will have bikes!

House was set up perfectly for our family of 5 and 2 in-laws. Inside is dated and carpet is badly stained.  Otherwise it was a fine place to stay in Sunriver.

This house is well-located to Sunriver and within biking distance for teenagers to be busy outside the house.  The hot tub is well maintained and the kitchen is easy to work in.  We had a terrific time and really relaxed.

It was sooo relaxing and after a lot of personal loss it was nice to be close to nature as well as have some fun stuff for the kids to burn some energy

We did miss having some adult bikes to do a family ride

Some extra towel needed

The light had no light bulbs that worked and we replaced the porch light bulb

We did have a good time and it was nice to be with family for new years

We loved Sun River and have already booked a stay at 6Flat Top again, same time next year!

We think the house and setting are great and our kids met and played w other kids in the cauldesac. Our only complaint is that there is no bike big enough for an adult over 5' 9". Could the owners make one more adult size bike available?

This house was perfect for our family of four.  The kids bunkroom was perfect.  The overall feel of the house was welcoming and felt like home.  It is spacious and cozy. The house is kept up very well, and we would love to stay again.  I would recommend bringing wood for the fireplace; nothing like a fire on a cold winter night.

This spacious family home is tucked away next to the second fairway of the Woodlands Golf Course, in the pleasantly peaceful northern section of beautiful Sunriver. With two luxurious master suites, a game room with pool table and ping-pong, and a private outdoor hot tub, this relaxing retreat offers something special for every member of the family.

Thanks to its multiple living areas and sprawling layout, the home is especially well-suited to two families traveling together. Everyone can gather together in the great room, which feels especially spacious thanks to its vaulted ceilings and wall of windows overlooking the golf course.

At one end of the great room, the gourmet kitchen makes preparing meals a delight with its hooded gas range, double stacked oven, and the all-important dishwasher. The cabinets are well-stocked with all the pots and pans, dinnerware, cooking utensils, and glassware you could need, and you'll also find a nice selection of countertop appliances (such as a coffee grinder, blender, and waffle iron). Two dining tables allow your group to spread out, with six spots at the kitchen's high-top bar table and four more near the cozy wood-burning stove.

After dinner, curl up around the sectional sofa with a fire burning on chilly winter nights. In the summer, you can even head outside to the beautiful patio, where a gas grill awaits for summer barbecues!

When your group wants to spread out and enjoy a little more elbow room, the kids will surely flock to the indoor game room. Here, a pool table, ping-pong, and basketball game will make any rainy afternoon fly past!

The home has three bedrooms a spacious loft and a bonus room with an additional futon, allowing up to eight guests to share the space quite comfortably (additional younger children may be permitted). On the lower level, there are two beautiful master suites. The first has a king bed and beautiful leaded glass doors that open onto a private outdoor hot tub, the perfect spot to end the night with a soak under the stars. Its attached bath also has a jetted tub, so you can soothe sore muscles after a day of hiking or skiing no matter what the weather is like outside.

The second master bedroom has a beautiful queen bed and its own private bath. Upstairs, the third bedroom has a comfortable full-sized bed and boasts the best views in the house, overlooking the golf course. Just off the game room, another cozy space offers a cable TV/DVD player, oversized armchair, and full-sized futon (not as private as a full bedroom, but great for a younger guest or two!).

The loft space offers an additional hideabed to curl up with a movie, or a sleeping area for extra guests. The house includes a third full bathroom, a washer/dryer, and wireless Internet access, making the home perfect for longer stays or working vacations.

And of course, all the fun of Sunriver awaits! The home is an obvious choice for a golfing getaway, with the lush fairways of Woodlands just outside your door. Thanks to its beautiful location in the northern section of Sunriver, the home is a bit more peaceful and removed than the busier southern area; however, getting around the resort is a breeze with the nine bicycles waiting in the garage (seven for adults, two for children)! Take advantage of your eight unlimited passes to SHARC, the new aquatic center with year-round swimming pools, saunas, and tubing hill; or, take a night off from cooking and head to the Village at Sunriver. Its restaurants, brewery, galleries, boutiques, and even seasonal ice-skating rink offer plenty of ways to spend a memorable evening!

In the winter, Sunriver comes alive as a ski resort, with the slopes of Mt. Bachelor just twenty minutes away. The rest of the year, its nearly forty miles of paved paths buzz with cyclists, and visitors head to the Deschutes River for fly fishing, kayaking, and whitewater rafting.

However you choose to spend your days in Sunriver, your family will love coming home each night to this beautiful golfside retreat!

This home is on the 11 th hole of the golf course in a culdesac...very quiet and enjoyed eating outdoors on the deck!  Also large 3 bedroom..spread out enough for three couples to have privacy .

Great home for a family or for two couples, as we were, as you have two separate areas for privacy. Quiet and well equipped kitchen for cooking.

Nice jacuzzi tub in master and outdoor jacuzzi for anyone. Note: if you are going to enjoy the SHARC..better go before Sept. as when we were there first of October, pretty much all of the SHARC was closed.

Great bike and walking paths!

The house was nicely appointed and sized well for our large group. A lot of space to spread out in. Sunriver is a great family vacation spot.

Our small family reunion had ample room in this spacious home. The house was located a nice distance away from many of the busier areas of Sunriver, but not too far. The bikes were definitely a nice amenity to the home, and were used every day. Located on the golf course provided great views and privacy for enjoying the back deck. The kitchen had everything you'd need to cook, and the stovetop and oven were very nice. Overall great house. Space, bikes, location, hot tub, dog friendly, amenities, etc. all great.

Our extended family of four adults and three young people enjoyed our stay in the lovely house at 10 Mugho Lane.  The house was spotlessly clean, had a fabulous game room (pool table/hoop/TV) that, along with the hot tub, kept the young ones very happy.  There were some bothersome equipment failures and it was almost impossible to contact VACASA by phone.  However, we definitely enjoyed our stay and the house suited our family's needs well.

Overall we enjoyed our stay at this house. It is easy to find once you enter into Sunriver and the driveway provided plenty of room to park several vehicles. There are three bedrooms and two hidabeds. Only one of the hidabeds is comfortable. The one upstairs is sunken in and you can feel the bars underneath from it being used so much. We did not use that one during our stay so a couple of our guests either had to sleep on the couch or the floor. The kitchen/living room area is very open and perfect for making dinner and socializing or playing board games. I would not go back here though unless I went with a smaller group of people. (6-7 adults)

Loved the layout.  We went with our two grown daughters and their husbands and it was great that there were really 3 separate area for sleeping.  Plus the game room with the pool table and ping pong table was a huge hit!

The large table in the kitchen was perfect for playing games into the late night.  Kitchen essentials were a bit lacking but we will definitely return and remember to bring a little more of that kind of stuff.

We had a great time at this rental. It has plenty of room and the game room is great for everyone. Our kids really loved ping pong and having their own space out there to be silly. The futon room was nice for any guest who needed quiet time in the morning. We had a great time at this property.

Nice house! We had a wonderful vacation over the Christmas holiday.  It was a bonus being on the golf course when it snowed-we could  cross country ski right out the door! I would definitely stay here again.

Perfect home for our family.  Loved relaxing on the back deck watching the golfers.  The occasional deer wandering by was an added bonus.

It was nice  have three bedrooms, the one futon in the game room might be ok if you have teenagers, but we did not use it as we had small children. the loft was nice but not private, so again with small kids it was hard to bed the down for the night.  The kitchen lay out was a bit cramped. But the neighborhood was quiet.

The five of us enjoyed the home.  It was nicely appointed, had everything that was needed for fixing meals in the kitchen and a nice BBQ on the deck.  We enjoyed using the hot tub, watching the deer that  came through the front yard daily, and having dinners on the deck each evening.

Great vacation home for multiple families or just one family! We had a blast over New Year's. The huge couch was perfect for lounging watching Bowl Games and the kitchen was fabulous for multiple cooks and large meals.

The house was well equipped and well laid out.  It was great having the game room away from the main house where the boys could be up late night without disturbing the rest of us.

Great house on the golf course... really a 3 Bedroom (2 masters)... but with sofa bed in upstairs loft a few more sleeping spots.  Very comfy house with some nice updates - great kitchen and deck.

This property is at the north end of SunRiver, so maybe not great if you plan to spend the days at Sharc. But it was an ideal base for us to use for our excursions to the volcanic sites, rafting, and other local attractions. There was adequate room for the 4 adults and 4 teens in our group, and the pool table, WiFi, and TVs ensured we all had things to do at night. We enjoyed the easy access to tennis courts (take the bikes), we watched golfers going by from the back patio, and took advantage of the big open space at Fort Rock Park to run our dog and to play frisbee and football with the kids.  Cooking facilities are excellent and well equipped.

We loved being on the golf course and having dinner on the back deck.

We rented this property for an executive retreat with spouses.  Lots of room to spread out in.  Really there were three bedrooms that I would feel comfortable putting people in.  There is a loft with a pull out and a 'bedroom' off the garage attached to the rec-room.  Thankfully we didn't have to put people in these rooms, but if I was expecting to use 5 bedrooms I would have been disappointed.  Great location, big open kitchen...loved it for 6 people.

This home is convenient to the North Pool but a schlep to the Village and SHARC on a hot day.  The accommodations were ok but definitely needs some updating.

Come stay at this gorgeous cabin-style Sunriver vacation rental and get ready for a fun-filled Central Oregon getaway! Featuring a private hot tub, recently remodeled interior, plenty of entertainment options, and access to the community's amazing amenities, you will surely love it here.

Located right in the center of Sunriver, this home is close to everything! Just a two-minute walk will take you to the SHARC, and within a little more than a mile you can find one of the resort's golf courses, and The Village area of town which has eateries and shops.

With three bedrooms (and a loft) and two bathrooms, as well as a gorgeous and recently remodeled interior, this home has everything you may need to have a comfortable stay. Step into the cabin-like interior and enjoy the warmth of the wood walls and architectural details, and maybe even start a fire in the gas fireplace for added coziness. The living room has some lovely seating where you can relax in front of the fire and watch the flatscreen TV.

Throughout this home you will have cable television, DVD players with a library of movies, WiFi access, and board games to play. You will even have a laundry room that will be useful for freshening up clothes after a few days of vacationing.

The ground level of this Sunriver getaway also features a stunning full kitchen. With beautiful countertops, wonderful wood cabinets, and new, gleaming appliances, the cook in your group will love spending time here! Sit down together at the dining room table and enjoy a home-cooked meal while the kids have their own space at the three-seat breakfast bar.

On the main floor you will also find two bedrooms. The master room contains a luxuriously large Queen-size bed and an enormous flatscreen TV that is perfect for watching the news or a late-night talk show before drifting off to sleep. A second bedroom on this level has a twin-over-full bunk bed and an additional full-size bed. A beautiful bathroom features a walk-in shower.

These sleeping spaces on the upper level share another full bathroom, so nobody will have to stumble downstairs to use the restroom. Altogether, up to 10 guests (eight adults maximum, please) are welcome to stay in this spacious and comfortable home.

Outside, you will be delighted to find a deck area with a gas grill and a private hot tub! Though this home comes with passes to the aquatic center in town (SHARC), you will love the privacy and peace of this hot tub. This would be a wonderful opportunity to take an after-dinner soak in the tub and watch the stars above while relaxing in the warm, bubbling water.

Within the community of Sunriver you will have an abundance of exciting activities to keep you busy. You can explore the 37 miles of walking and biking trails, visit one of the 26 tennis courts, or book a tee time at one of the resort's four golf courses. If you're traveling with children, they will love the playgrounds and the wonderful SHARC, which has indoor and outdoor pools, hot tubs, water slides, and outdoor recreation areas. In Sunriver you can also book a whitewater rafting trip on the nearby Deschutes River, take a guided horseback ride, or go shopping or get a meal in The Village area of town.

With dazzling forested scenery nearby, visitors can go hiking or mountain biking in the woods, or even go skiing at Mt. Bachelor (30 minutes away) during the winter. And since the fantastic city of Bend is just a 25-minute drive up the highway, you can easily take a quick trip into town for more urban options. Bend is famous for its breweries, so if you work up a thirst while exploring the museums, galleries, shops, and riverfront parks in the city, stop in at the Deschutes Brewery for a pint and some pub food.

Book this lovely Central Oregon vacation rental and get ready for a fun-filled visit spent relaxing in the private hot tub, taking advantage of Sunriver's amenities, and exploring the nearby region!

Awesome stay! The house was beautiful and Vacasa was so awesome to work with. They let us have late check out which was great so we could hot tub and shower after a day of skiing and before we got on the long road for home. Bummer the gas fireplace was out of order and the living room could have used one more piece of furniture. ONLY negatives about it tho!!

We have stayed in Sunriver in the past and when we had a wedding to attend in Bend we decided to make a long weekend of it. Great place to stay, close to the water park and the kids had a blast. Comfortable beds and beautiful surroundings. Just a bit difficult to find.

the spa was great the house looks bigger in the picture is very small but it was great

We never write bad reviews but with me having to call vacasa practically everyday really put a burden on me. Fireplace wasn't wor and we weren't aware until we arrived as well as the hot tub. Also the Internet didn't work so we had to unplug everything to figure out how to get it to work. The beds were very cozy and there was a lit of room. The kitchen was very nice as equipped with everything needed. We fit a lot of use from the washer and dryer bc we had a 6 week old baby that needed many washes of clothing.

A private washer and dryer will keep you comfortable for extended stays and the indoor wood sauna will ease your adventure weary bones! Of course, why wait for the sauna to heat up when you can dip into the hot tub?

This condo had all of the basics, and then some.  Well laid out floor plan, and lots of room for our family of three.  We will definitely be back.

Awesome pet friendly condo, located perfectly for golf, fishing, biking and the pool !!  we love our sun river,  we've been coming every summer for over 30 years for family re-unions and just good ole fun !!

A great four nights with our four children. The outside front door light was not working, nor was the neighbors so it made for a very dark area of the unit.

We are so happy we chose to stay here during the off season as it would not be possible to afford the rates during the summer :(

Telephone support staff were friendly and very helpful.

Thank you!

We enjoyed our stay. But would have loved more comfortable living room furniture. We loved the location of this end unit. Beds were comfortable. Older interior, but good price and dog friendly.  Housekeeping could use a few improvements.

Super clean and cozy condo. Awesome games, great location near the nature center and pool passes-perfect weekend getaway for our family!  Had an issue with the carbon monoxide alarms (yes, both) "chirping" and Vacasa staff took care of it right away. Great service, thank you!!!

We had a wonderful stay at Quelah 12.   It is perfect for 4 people.   So very well stocked, it was amazing.   Very clean.   Great experience.

the place was great for what we wanted..the only issues were NO ESPN (which is the weirdest thing) and the internet acted up a little but the GREAT property manager named Mark was all over everything I asked..will use this property over and over again..I just can't get enough of Sunriver/Bend...it's the best place in the country to spend a week in my humble opinion

ES-California

The Quelah 12 Condo was just a great place to stay for our family of five and two dogs. The only issue we had was that the WIFI only worked with our PC and not any of our ipads or iphones. Also the password for the WIFI is in correct in the email information sent out, but correct in the book in the condo. Oh one other thing is the front pouch light went out after our first night. All in all it was a great place to stay and we would stay there again in a heart beat. Thank you

Loved our stay in Sunriver.  Quelah 12 Condo had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Appreciated having such a great place to stay so close to Mt. Bachelor.  Booking with Vacasa was easy  for our last minute decision to hit the slopes.

The condo was perfect for us.  I was worried about noise, but we never heard a peep.  Very nice that it sits on the end, it is quite private. The pool was great and really nice that we could walk there and take a dip and be home in seconds. Beds were comfortable, washer/dryer are huge, kitchen is well stocked with dishes and pans. The cable TV doesn't get ESPN. . . but we learned to live without it because we were busy biking, walking and swimming.  I would stay there again and recommend to friends.

Great location, had everything we needed. Great place for a family with kids, if you don't want to go the the Sharc, you can use the pool/jacuzzi at the condo. Would definitely stay there again.

This condo is well cared for and very clean. The beds are comfortable and everything works well. There are 3 bikes available on the property, but they are mostly for adults. If you have kids you can either bring your own bikes or rent some from the local bike shop (not very expensive). We loved staying in Quelah 12 and would come again/recommend the property to friends.

Nice clean home and the rental company was outstanding to deal with!

Staying in Quelah makes squeezing in a trip to the pool between other activities very easy. The kids got their daily pool time without us going to SHARC every day. We appreciated the option the owner-provided SHARC passes provided and it made keeping the promises of pool time easy!

Convenient, Clean, and easy accessibility to all. Reservations easy and convenient!

This nicely-updated, three bedroom Sunriver vacation rental is full of classic design touches like a sleek gas fireplace, leather sofas, and beautiful hardwood floors, but with an eye towards comfort that the whole family will appreciate. Spend afternoons out on the patio, enjoying the high dessert breezes or bike down to SHARC for an afternoon of fun by the outdoor pools.

After a day spent tooling around Sunriver's hiking and biking trails, come back to your cozy Polehouse Lane getaway for a little R&R in front of the flat screen TV. There's cable, a DVD player, and even WiFi. Just pop the popcorn and gather the family around for a movie marathon.

Right off the living room is the large outdoor deck. This space is perfect for early morning yoga or an after-dinner glass of wine. On sunny afternoons, fire up the gas grill for a backyard BBQ. No matter the year, chances are it will be pleasantly sunny!

The full kitchen is packed with major appliances (including a dishwasher), a microwave, coffee grinder, blender, slow cooker, and even a toaster. Prepare a leisurely weekend brunch or a make-your-own taco party with slow-cooked black beans. The dining room table seats six, in addition to the deck's seating for another six, so making an adult and a kids table is quite easy.

The three bedrooms include two king sized beds and one with a full and twin bed. These rooms have lots of windows, boasting tree-lined views, cozy quilts, and accessories like TVs, a telescope, and colorful artwork. In the loft, you'll also have a set of twin bunk beds, assuring that everyone in your group will find the perfect place to retire each night.

And when you stay at this home, you'll get unlimited-use SHARC passes!

During ski season, you can grab a shuttle right from Sunriver to Mt. Bachelor Ski Resort (for a small fee), or make the short 20 minute drive yourself. There's also cross-country skiing and snowshoeing right nearby. And if you plan a stay during the holidays, you can take a festive sleigh ride right around the resort.

We enjoyed our stay here, albeit brief.  Only complaint and not much of one is we were unsure whether the unit had a/c or not. We gathered not, as there were some fans about,  but it was pretty unclear.  Otherwise the condo is in great shape, beds are nice and we had everything  we needed!

This was the first time we have stayed at sunriver and we are very happy with the house we chose. It was clean and peaceful it had everything we needed. Absolutely loved that the sharc passed were included with our house. We hope to return back to this same house in the fortune and I highly command this house.

Please be aware that many of the homes in Sunriver do not have air conditioning.  Central Oregon is very warm in the summer.  The home we rented did not have air conditioning.    When we arrived, the home was 92 degrees inside.  Make sure to ask if the home you are considering has air conditioning.  Other than that, the area is beautiful and it is a fun place to visit.

Ideal location, close to everything.  Well furnished.  We had a very lovely week.  I can't wait until I can return for another visit.

Overall as advertised.   Good time was had by all.    Be aware there is no AC so it can be quite warm inside and there are no bikes for use.

We had a relaxing week in Sunriver and Pole House 4 is a beautiful and quite location. Near SHARC, tennis, bike paths and Pet Friendly!

We've been visiting the Bend/Sunriver area for over 30 years and this stay is at the top of our list!

Great location near everything, cozy cabin, lots of activities and lots of fun!

With festive Southwestern decor, a cozy gas fireplace, and even a private outdoor hot tub, this four-bedroom home makes for a laid-back yet amenity-packed Sunriver getaway!

Tucked away in the quiet northeastern section of the resort town, you can enjoy peaceful mornings sipping coffee on the deck, breathing in the pine-scented air and making your plans for the day. Kayaking along the Deschutes River? A round of golf at nearby Woodlands? A day of swimming, soaking, or tubing at SHARC? After all, your stay here at 16 Lassen Lane comes with ten free passes to the brand-new aquatic center.

However you choose to spend your days, you'll love calling this well-priced retreat your home-away-from-home! The living area is sunny and bright, with colorful Southwestern furnishings, a cozy gas fireplace, and sliding glass doors leading out to the deck. Settle in with a good movie on the cable TV with DVD player, or spread out with a board game on the coffee table.

Behind the living area, the cheery full kitchen is stocked with all the pots and pans, dinnerware, and cooking utensils you need to prepare meals for your group. On sunny days, you can even head out to the deck and barbecue on the gas grill. The dining table seats up to ten guests for those hearty family-style breakfasts before a long day on the hiking trails or ski slopes! You're also an easy walk from the Marketplace, so it's easy to keep your fridge stocked full of groceries and a rotating selection of DVDs on hand (not to mention the new liquor store for margarita fixings!).

The one-story home has four bedrooms and two full baths. The master bedroom has a lovely king-sized bed and its own TV; the second bedroom has two twin-sized beds; the third has a queen-sized bed; and the fourth has a queen and a twin, perfect for a couple traveling with a small child or a few kids bunking together. Along with the living room's comfortable sleeper sofa, up to ten guests can comfortably share the space. With a washer/dryer and wireless Internet access, the home is perfect for longer stays and working vacations. Even better, you don't need to leave any family members at home: well-behaved dogs are welcome with a $10 per night, per pet fee ($40 minimum per stay).

Bachelor are just twenty minutes away, perfect for skiers and snowboarders. The nearby Village at Sunriver, in addition to its restaurants and shops, opens a seasonal ice-skating rink. Warmer months find the nearly forty miles of paved bike paths buzzing with cyclists, plus the multiple swimming pools and tennis courts full of guests. Book a guided trip along the Deschutes via whitewater raft or kayak, or simply walk to the river's edge to explore on your own.

And at the end of every long day, you can return to your peaceful getaway. Whether you soak in the outdoor hot tub or gather around the fireplace, your family will love spending time together in this special Sunriver vacation home!

Wonderful time in Sunriver.  Loved being at the north end, near the bike path.  Lots of room and light in this well designed home.

We ended up with 10 adult family members and two dogs staying in the residence.  We were visiting Sunriver for a larger family reunion which took place about a mile away.

The enclosed area in the front was great for the dogs and the house was just what our family members needed.  It is roomy enough for individual privacy and intimate enough for great family times.  All of the needed kitchen accessories were there.  We used the hot tub and appreciated its convenience, cleanliness and private location.

Thank you so much.  We hope to return next summer.

This was a great layout for two families. We went with another family, each of us has two young boys (all under 6). And we fit in this house together comfortably.

Beware that the beds are not super comfy, but otherwise easy living!

Nice property with all of the necessary amenities. Lots of hot water and good water pressure.

We love Sunriver, it was hard to come home after such a great week skiing, dog sledding, hiking, biking and we also squeezed in a visit to the Desert High Museum.  It was a great week and we will definitely be back to visit.

Overall we had a lovely time.  Appreciated that the property was very dog friendly and clean.  Plenty of towels, blankets & pillows.   Hot tub was very nice and beds were comfy.  Having the store nearby was handy.

We did have a problem many of the light bulbs being burned out and not being able to find any replacements in the house.

We had to hunt around to figure out what to do with our recyclables and finally figure out we could take them to the nearby store, but it would have been helpful to have that info in the house.  FYI, kitchen doesn't have any "basic" supplies like oil or spices, so you'll need to bring EVERYTHING you need for cooking.

Nice, spacious one level house. Had pretty much everything we needed. Satellite  TV, Wi-fi, games and so on... The house was clean and ready to stay in. The hot tub was fully functional  and was pretty awsome to be surrounded by snow and sit in a swimsuit in a hot tub. There is a store 5 min walking that has pretty much everything. Had s great time and will be back! Thanks Vacasa

When you vacation in Sunriver during the winter the one thing you want is a nice

warm place to come back to after skiing all day. The heater was broke 3 out of the 4 days we were there so it was not welcoming to come home to this house.

Our family had a wonderful week enjoying activities in central Oregon while staying at 16 Lassen Lane in Sunriver.  The layout of the house brings people together in a central area for enjoying TV, games at the dining room table, or cooking in the kitchen.  Not much hiding out in bedrooms for our gang on this vacation!   The north grocery store and bike paths are easily accessed from the property which can be accessed from Hwy 97 without meandering through the resort.

Very nice house with a good layout to accomodate a large family or  more than one family.

We recently made a last minute decision to spend a few days in Sunriver and found 16 Lassen Lane was available. Although the property was bigger than our family of three really needed, we loved our stay there. It was clean and had great amenities like the hot tub and air hockey table. We will definitely look to rent this property again!

It was great to have a roomy, clean place to meet up with family. We live in Southern Oregon and the kids live in the Portland area, so Sunriver is our halfway point. The house was clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed.

We had a great stay.  The house had everything we needed. Comfortable beds and furnishings. Everything worked well,  we had no problems getting on the internet or using the nice big TV's . So close to the store.  Literally 2 minutes to walk there.  You couldn't see it because of the nice trees, etc.  but it was so close and we trotted over there often for snacks, etc.  it was nice that we could take our pet.  The house was clean and nothing noticeable  that other pets had stayed there.  The fenced courtyard in front was nice to let the dog out for awhile and know that it would be safe.

We definitely would stay here in the future. It was a comfortable home, open  and airy. To walk out to the trails was a plus, being pet friendly and have an enclosed area was great!  Thank you, we had a great Christmas break!

Great layout and separation of bedrooms for 10 of us, two being young children.  More of a walk that we'd have liked to The Village and Lodge, but a complimentary shuttle is available and fast!  Didn't realize until we'd already booked that this house is closest to Mavericks swim and workout center.  Beautiful place, but the free passes are to Sharks which is not convenient walk or bike ride during the winter.  Would go again.

16 Lassen is a very nice rambler. Great room in the middle. Open kitchen. Bedrooms 2 on each side. We went with our 5 daughters aged 22-4 and wonderful time was had by all!  Home is comfortable and kitchen has all the basics. We grilled every night.  Hot tub is newer. And you are conveniently located by mavericks and a quick store run that's well supplied and great for late night ice cream needs!  You are a bit from sharc and the village so if you plan on biking, especially with little ones you may want to bring it from home or rent in town.   We would definitely rent this property again!

We had a great time.  There was pool towels, plenty of bedding, bikes available for use in garage, great sized kitchen.  We had a great family vacation on the property.

Nice home with a hot tub at a great price. No air conditioning made it a little hot during our stay but envy thing cooled down at night and judisicous use of fans kept the home comfortable. The Marketplace is just a few minutes walking time out the back door and down a path which made it easy for us to keep the refrigerator well stocked. The North side of Sunriver is a lot quieter than the village area.  SHARC was super crowded during the day but the crowds eased up in the late afternoon. Recommend that you bring your own bikes to ride as the bikes at this house were of  poor quality and two had flats.

This property is in a great location - close to a grocery store, gas station, and tennis court. It's a short drive to SHARC. The house has an open living room, dining room, kitchen area with two bedrooms on either side of the open area. It's a very efficient lay-out. Enjoy!

Convenient to store and tennis.  Great perk to have passes to SHARC.  Spacious and comfortable with bedrooms on either end of living area.  Great value.

The house and its amenaties met the needs of my family.  It was clean, everything worked as needed, and the location was perfect.  The Sunriver resort is a wonderful place to visit if you enjoy the outdoors, but quiet enough if you want to stay indoors.  If you like biking, hiking, getting out of the city, but don't mind the 6 hour drive from Seattle.  This is a great place to be with the family and friends.

Forest views with community pool, tennis, and more!

When you stay in this cozy two-bedroom Sunriver vacation rental, you might feel as though you're staying in a resort-within-a-resort. With its own seasonal tennis court, swimming pool, and hot tub, the Quelah community offers a bit of insulation from the weekend crowds while still keeping you in the heart of all the action of Sunriver.

Just 18 miles from Bend, and about 21 miles from Mt. Bachelor, this home is a great year-round destination.

This lovely retreat offers the perfect mix of rustic central Oregon charm along with all the modern comforts of home. For instance, in the great room, a cable TV with DVD player is set into the beautiful stone facade of the wood-burning fireplace. With sliding glass doors leading out to the patio, you can enjoy the lovely forest views even while watching the big game from the cozy sofa.

On the opposite side of the great room, the fully-equipped kitchen is stocked with pots and pans, dinnerware, cooking utensils, and the all-important dishwasher for easy cleanup. The kitchen overlooks the dining table and living area, so that the amateur chef in your group can still socialize with everyone while preparing meals.

If you'd like to enjoy the fresh air even while cooking dinner, head to the entrance courtyard where a gas grill awaits for summer barbecues! Out back, shady aspen trees make the rear deck and backyard feel wonderfully private, offering a perfect spot to sip your morning coffee and listen to the birds sing.

The second bedroom has two twin beds and its own bath, and the living room's sofa unfolds into a very comfortable full-sized bed.

With a washer/dryer and wireless Internet access provided, the condo is wonderful for longer stays or working vacations. In the winter months, skiers and snowboarders will find the slopes of Mt. Bachelor waiting only 20 minutes away, and the nearby Village at Sunriver offers a seasonal ice-skating rink in addition to its boutiques, restaurants, brewery, and outfitters.

We were very surprised by how much we liked everything.  From the cleanliness to the layout, the location and proximity to everything in Sunriver, we will be back!

Everything overall was wonderful. This Unit is just older therefore less expensive. Great location for Sunriver Holiday.

1. The dining room chairs were so wobbly that it felt like anytime you moved in them they would break.

2. It would be nice to have at least 2 keys to the condo.

3.  In the house â€œrulesâ€ it said to use proper BBQ tools, there were none. The BBQ is also falling apart and the auto light does not work we had to use a lighter to start the BBQ.   Also we had to call for more propane so that we could BBQ.

4.The first night I pulled back the covers on the master bed to find dirty sheets!  The last thing I wanted or should have to do when you pay over $200 a night is have to change the sheets because they were dirty!

5. We also had to buy our own dishwasher soap.  They left enough for 4 loads of dishes.  We were there for a week!!

It was a great home away from home, and we didn't have to worry about packing anything but food and cloths. We do like to cook our own meals, and everything was provided and worked really well. We did feel at home.

I am a vacation property owner myself so I like  to compare other properties to mine. This place was very well set up with plenty of extra bedding and nice  furniture. The kitchen was well equipped with plenty of cookware and the coffee was a nice bonus! A laminated  map of Sunriver Resort framed on the wall in the unit would be very helpful because it is HUGE and with all the circles ...11 or 12...we got lost a few times.

This property is great and located perfectly. Everything is walking distance with beautiful trails. The Nature Center, Observatory, and SHARC are a short walk if  you don't want to drive. I highly recommend staying here. We will definitely be back.

Would pay a little more for a nicer property.

We loved staying at 68 Quelah. The warm, cozy yet spacious condo was perfect for us and our pooches. It made us want to live there full time. Loved walking the trails and seeing deer. We'll definitely be back again.

I liked that we were a little further from the Village/SHARC.  Wanted to take full advantage of bike rides. It was great to always be on a path. Couple of spots on map didn't match up. Couldn't hear neighbors. Felt very safe and relaxing place. Could stay all summer and any school breaks possible.

It was wonderful and we hope to come back when the snow is falling

Great:

Nothing hurt the enjoyment of our trip (hooray VHS movie collection and SHARC passes!).

Everything was neat, clean, and functional.

Not great:

This home is in pretty bad need of cosmetic and infrastructure upgrades. Several minor maintenance issues, and one huge one (garage flooded) during our stay.

Issues did not hurt our trip, but this house needs some maintenance and amenity repair if it's going to withstand the wear and tear of a rental property.

We are a pretty laid back family when it comes to rental quality, as long as it's clean and everything works, we're OK.  Someone who is pickier than us may want to keep looking.  We would rent through Vacasa again, just not this property.

Well, we go to sunriver every year. Every year I spend a lot of time searching for the right house with the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms and amenities. We wanted to full baths (at least) hot tub, games, etc.. This is NOT what we got... The upstairs bathroom shower (the one by the bedrooms) did not work. No water which als lead me to believe it hadn't been cleaned either before we got there. They came out to fix it and it only worked for one shower use. Than was broken again. We had to all share the shower downstsairs across the house. The hot tub was falling apart and was unsafe to step into. The pH and chlorine balance was off. We had maintainance guys coming in and out. When the hot tub guy came he came unannounced into the backyard and scared my daughters. Game pieces to the fooseball and air hockey where missing. Dealing with unhelpful vacasa agents and maintance guys while we are suppose to be on vacation is really unfair. Vacasa never offered reimbursement for us missing a whole bathroom, hot tub or games for our stay (big reasons why I had chosen that house) not to mention I dont think the house was cleaned before we got there. I feel dooped..... This will be a great house once its ready and if they get a different property management.

We truly enjoyed having the unlimited passes to the SHARC! Thank you.

The location of the house was perfect, it is within walking distance to the SHARC and The Village, it's important when you have a toddler.  The pictures here make the house look smaller, there was a total of  6 in our group and never felt over crowded.  The bikes were a plus!

Great location, very convenient. Kitchen is well stocked with tools, small applicances --Inside furniture needs updating though.

We loved the fire place.  Tje kids (age 11) loved sleeping in the loft.  Having bikes and swim passes kept us busy and active and off electronics!  The cabin was clean and cosy and quiet.  We will come back some summer and do the lava lands.

7 Hare Lane was noting short of a great place.  Everything was so comfortable, and the amenities were awesome - fully furnished kitchen, pool passes (including SHARC), bicycles, very short walk to the Village, etc.  I've stayed in many other homes in Sunriver and this is by far my favorite.  Super comfortable - super place - super resortwe're already planning our next trip back.

Thank you for a home base to stay while we played in the areaa. We were so comfortable and felt right at home.

We enjoyed staying at 7 Hare Lane.  It was close to the village and Sharc's.  The kids had fun riding the bikes to the village.  We all enjoyed the Sharc's hot tub after a snowy day of skiing.

Great little house for a couple or small family to get away. Parking is limited so I would not recommend this house for more than a group with 2 vehichles.  Great location for walking or riding your bikes to the Village or SHARC.  Loved having passes provided.

Don't hesitate at all - this property was delightful!

Location was great!  Having access to the SHARC was really cool and it was really noce how close to town it was!

We had a nice stay at Ranch Cabin #38.  It was clean and comfortable.  It was a nice place to land after a day of activity.  We enjoyed breakfast on the deck and morning bike rides.

If you need a place to sleep 2 couples and more than 2 children, this might be it.   Be warned, however, that the place is more cramped than it appears in the photos and that the carpet is not in great shape.  Otherwise, the place is adequate for a 7-person group (2 couples, + 3 kids).  Pretty good kitchen gear, including an excellent coffee grinder.  Unclear whether the rental includes parking in front.

One of the newest homes in the original heart of Sunriver awaits your next golf getaway or ski weekend! With two master suites and a private outdoor hot tub, this well-appointed getaway offers well appointed amenities in a very comfortable and cozy family-friendly home. All the shopping and dining of the Village at Sunriver are just a short walk away, but the home feels very peaceful nestled in the evergreens quiet Jay Lane.

This lovely cabin in the woods is perfect for a few couples traveling together or even a dual-family vacation. In the airy great room, vaulted windows overlook the surrounding forest, and an open floor plan makes it easy for your whole group to spend time together. In the seating area, a plush sectional sofa sits before the handsomely tiled gas fireplace and a cable TV with DVD player. On chilly winter nights, there is no better spot for a movie night!

Just behind the living area, the open kitchen makes it easy for the chef in the group to socialize with other guest while making use of the updated appliances and well-stocked cabinets (all the pots and pans, dishes, cooking utensils, and dinnerware you might need is provided). Four stools line the breakfast bar for casual snacking or sipping on a glass of wine, and a six-person dining table sits before the towering windows so you can enjoy the forest views while you eat.

Of course, in warmer weather, you can head to the outdoor patio to soak up the sunshine and fresh mountain air. Plenty of seating is provided for outdoor dining or an afternoon game of cards, and the nearby hot tub is surrounded by a half-wall for extra privacy. After a day spent hiking, fishing, skiing, or simply window-shopping, nothing feels better than soaking under the stars!

The home has three bedrooms and three full baths, and has been thoughtfully designed to provide extra space for two couples or families vacationing together. The traditional master bedroom has a king bed, television set, and attached bath. The second master bedroom is in the beautifully refurbished garage, carefully transformed to provide a separate suite with queen bed, sitting area with cable TV/DVD player, private bath, and easy access to the hot tub and deck. The third bedroom has a comfortable queen-sized bed and its own television set.

Older guests or those with mobility issues will find the house quite accessible, with virtually no stairs and a walk-in shower. Those planning longer stays will certainly appreciate the on-site washer/dryer and wireless Internet access.

This special getaway has a fantastic location in the original heart of Sunriver, but is considerably newer and brighter than most of its neighboring homes. Few other vacation rentals offer the same combination of such a central location and modern amenities, making this house a unique find! One of Sunriver's 37 miles of paved bike paths passes right by the house, and within a mile of your front door are many of the town's most popular destinations: shopping and dining at the Village, indoor swimming pools and year-round tubing hill at SHARC, and golfing at the Meadows, which offers 18 lushly landscaped holes as well as an all-ages putting course.

We had the most excellent stay at Sun River - terrific bike trails, hiking, SHARC swim center - something for everyone to do!

It would have been a more comfortable stay had the air conditioning worked. The many house fans mitigated the heat somewhat.  Bed mattresses need to be replaced/updated.

We just spent 2 nights at 4 Jay Lane and it was quite nice. In a good location right next to one of the main bike paths in SR. This home had a nice kitchen, sleeping for 4 adults and we brought along our 2 grandchildren. One nice "perk" of 4 Jay Lane was the SHARC passes that were available, the kids love that play! Overall our stay was very nice and comfortable.

A very nice house.  As we were two married couples, the privacy of the bedrooms was greatly appreciated.  The house is in a great location; walking distance to The Village and to the SHARC.

Our stay was so relaxing. Our home was clean and the kitchen especially was well equipped. The hot tub was wonderful, especially when it was snowing. The beauty outside was so wonderful. Very quiet and peaceful stay. Thank you for a great vacation experience.

4 Jay Lane in Sun River, OR. is a nice, fully equipped little cabin.  The location is great- close to the village, and not far from the ski area. The cabin is not luxurious,  and there is no garage, but was just fine for our family to call home for three days.

We live in Sunriver and rented the house for family members for Thanksgiving. The house was well stocked with cooking supplies, but after that it left us wanting a bit. No propane for the grill, the key for the hot tub didn't work, house wasn't deep cleaned, furniture is dated. These are all nit-picky things, but for the price we paid I have rented much nicer, more modern houses in the area. Looks bigger in the pictures than it felt like.

Vacasa comes through again!  This is the second time we've stayed at Jay 4 and will do it again.  Great clean (no pets/smoking) one level home , 3 bdrm, 3 bath, 4 TV, HT, SNARC  passes.  What's to want for?  Well, upgrading the master bdrm TV to a 26" or even a 32" would be nice.  Oh, and maybe add a cheapo DVD player while you're at it?  Kinda hard watching while relaxing in bed.   All in all a wonderful experience.  Snowed 3" second day, but didn't deter us and our grandsons one bit.  Went to the High Desert Museum and Goody's Chocolate Factory Tour....and then the indoor SNARC pool.  Rode bikes the next day through some slush on the bike paths.  A very memorable experience riding and throwing snowballs to Fort Rock Park.  Just can't say enough about the fun in Sunriver.  Thanks VACASA for your professionalism and to the owners of Jay 4 for sharing their home with us.

This place was very lovely. It has adequate room for a family and is an identifiable color. This is useful because it easy to spot from the back,  while your riding bikes to find your way home. The kitchen had a varied amount of pans, utensils, etc. for cooking. It was a clean, comfortable place with a lovely view!

For the money, this house delivers.  The gas fireplace puts out quite a bit of heat so it is very practical as well as aesthetically pleasing.  It is not a luxurious house but if you are trying to be thrifty it is a great vacation house.  The location is great and with a couple of minor repairs, as noted ,this house is a great choice.  We called the converted garage the "downstairs bedroom" due to the one step! After a pretty cool first night we discovered a hidden heater behind the hide a bed couch.  Turned this on and the room was very comfortable.

We had a fantastic time this past President's weekend at 4 Jay Lane. The property was  clean, well maintained, and the instructions for entry and check out were very clear. Would definitely go back again.

The house was minutes from the Village, with a bike bath right behind the house. Yet house was still very private and quiet; best of both worlds. House was very clean and well stocked - even coffee beans! Nice hot tub too. I would definitely stay here again!

We were really happy with this house.  We have rented more expensive, "fancier" places in sunriver, only to be dissappointed with broken hot tubs, faulty thermostats, shotty cookwear ect.  This house is simple, but very well kept.  Most importantly, the hot tub was nice and hot.  This is so crucial for a sunriver stay.  My son loved having his own little area off the entry way and we appreciated how helpful the vacasa staff was.  The only thing people may want to consider is that there is no garage and only one parking space.  We were fine with that because it was just us staying here but multiple car parties may want to check if additional parking could be arranged.  This was our best sunriver experience and we will be going with vacasa from now on.  Thank you!

Clean and cozy place to stay within minutes from grocery store, etc.

It was so fun being so close to the Village and SHARC.  We loved walking in the snow to the village every morning and the kids loved the hot tub.  It was also nice that you supplied coffee and all the fixins.  The sparkling cider and the New Years horns were a very nice unexpected surprise.  Thanks.

We enjoyed our stay at 14 Pole House.  This house/cabin is comfortable enough, nothing fancy but completely fine for a weekend of skiing or summer fun where you are on the go throughout the day and just need a comfortable, cozy spot for a bbq on the deck or chilling watching a movie at night.  There is a DVD player but VERY few options for renting DVDs and not much in the way of movie channels.  The one Redbox at the general store was out of service and there was no other options so we weren't able to watch movies - no biggie, but just good info.  The Vacasa staff were really pleasant and available - when we first go there we had trouble with the lockbox for the key - and the Vacasa staff were available to help us trouble shoot the problem and we got right in - turns out we were at the wrong house! The house has a large amount of space where there is just open field surrounding it- nice for deer-watching in the evenings and mornings.  All in all, the description of the house on the VRBO website is accurate and this is an affordable, comfortable, basic house/cabin and we had a very nice time there this weekend.

We loved the location of the cabin but weren't crazy about the cabin.  It could use some updating with more comfortable (and more) seating in the living room.  The master bed wasn't actually a king sized bed, but two twins put together.  The cabin didn't seem like it had been cleaned before we got there.  If you want to be right by SHARC and don't care about the above issues, this is the place for you.

Great location!  The house was clean and supplied well.  Plenty of room for a family of 5.  It was very hot and management quickly delivered two fans to cool the house.

This was our second visit and we wish we would have taken more days. House is bright, comfortable, with two huge bedrooms, twin loft upstairs and plenty of space with another play space above loft.  Fabulous family vacation place, with the aquatics center two minutes away. Best place for active families and if you want to rest, read on the deck and enjoy the sun.

The location near SHARC was perfect for our family.  The house has great appeal for children, with not one but two lofts.  The kitchen was well-supplied for cooking.  All in all, we would happily return.

Great home for a family adventure in Sunriver.  Walking distance to SHARC and close to the bike trail.

There wasn't a new sponge in the kitchen, just an old one under the sink. I would have liked a new sponge.....we ended up going and buying one.

Great location, easy access to SHARC and the village is just a short bike ride away.  Great house for kids, our kids loved the loft.  For the price it's tough to beat.

The staff was wonderful in helping us make our reservations.  They let us in early and we were able to stay a little longer than check out.

We had fun over Christmas.   Vacasa even answered their phone on Christmas day and helped us with some TV settings!

The house was perfect for 3-6 people, with nice large king beds in 2 room and small singles upstairs loft.  Plenty of cooking equipment and grill outside.  Good house for the price.

This is a very cool little ski cottage. It has very nice hardwood walls, ceilings, floors, etc... An awesome 70s vintage feel. An upstairs loft that my kids (ages 3 and 6) loved! Very close to SHARC and the Village shops. Some of the interior needs to be updated. The kitchen table and microwave leave something to be desired and there is no A/C; however, the beds are nice and big, the TV is nice and big, good dishwasher and oven, the bathrooms are nicely remodeled, and you are walking/biking distance to tons of cool stuff. Bend and Bachelor are also only a short drive. Very nice, cool, retro ski place and we'll stay there again.

Loved that kitchen was well stocked.

comfortable home a quiet location. tv to small and old to watch super bowl

Very close to SHARC aquatic Center and Shopping. SHARC passes were included very cool.  SHARC was just the right size and not overly crowded like other water parks we have been to. Though not on the Golf course directly you still had a view of it.  Enjoyed kayaking the Deschutes River, The nearby Volcanic park and lava river caves.  Don't miss the observatory for fabulous night sky viewing. Great trails for Bike riding, though the bikes that were in the shed had flat tires, which was only momentarily disappointing as affordable rentals available nearby or bring your own.  We brought Kayaks and didn't have room for our bikes.  Lots of other things to do that we couldn't get around to.   The only thing I could have asked for more was a private hot tub. Hint! Hint!  But we still soaked in the one at SHARC.  Property was dated showing its age but with a hip retro 70s cabin vibe and lots of knotty pine.  Imagine IKEA before it was cool. We liked it a lot but it maybe not for everyone though.  Some updates have been done, and a few minor maintenance issues such as a split in the wood in the front steps that needs to be replaced. Cool double loft bonus sleeping area which would be great fun for little kids kind of like a tree house.  Nice gas fire place, Gas BBQ grill on deck with outdoor eating space.  Well equipped easy to use indoor kitchen with dishwasher.  Saved us a bunch of money cooking our own meals.  Also Washer and dryer in unit was great to have.  Not too close to the neighbors you still have privacy. Deer were right outside our door one morning.  very cool.  Overall 2 thumbs up.

We had a great time! The staff at Vacasa was very attentive.  We were very happy with our experience!

You'll really be able to get away from it all when you arrive at this lovely, two-bedroom La Pine vacation rental! And don't worry about pet sitters, this Sunriver region retreat is even pet-friendly, so you can bring along your furry family members.

Although right near Sunriver Resort, this secluded cabin is not a part of the resort and does not have access to its amenities. But, with a great location right near La Pine State Park and Fall River access, you'll have plenty to keep you occupied. There are gorgeous mountain views from the property's 40 acres, and if you need a little excitement, it's just 18 miles to Bend proper for gallery browsing, brewery hopping, and great shopping!

This modern log cabin is charming on the outside and just as delightful on the inside! You'll have tall, slanted ceilings, hardwood floors, and a wood-burning fireplace. Snuggle up in front of the fire on a cozy evening and read. While you won't have a TV here, you will have WiFi, so you can still keep in touch and entertained.

Have your meals at the rustic dining table, while the sun streams in or the colors from the sunset provide a lovely backdrop for dinner. There are also a couple of spots along the breakfast bar for a kids' table or for quick snacks before heading off on a hike.

The full kitchen has everything you'll need for meals including a dishwasher and plenty of counter space. Stop at the store in town and pick up some groceries for wonderful vacation meals. And if you do crave a meal out, all of Bend's eateries are just a 35-minute drive away.

At the end of your fun-filled days, two bedrooms provide space for up to six guests. The master has a king bed, while the second bedroom hosts a twin bunk bed set and a full bed, and out in the living room, there is a sofabed for even more sleeping options. If you do bring your dogs, it's just an additional nightly fee.

Other amenities at this relaxing getaway include a washer and dryer for clean clothes. You will also have two full bathrooms - one being the private bathroom just for the master bedroom.

While here, Oregon's vibrant high desert will be the location for a memorable family getaway or even a relaxing, stay-cation if you live in the area. Boasting a sense of serenity and privacy, 40-acres to explore, and even access to the Fall River (perfect for fly fishing!), this will be a one-of-a-kind retreat! Spend your days hiking and biking, or head to town for some big city excitement.

Sisters is about a 45-minute drive from here for the rodeo and you can be skiing at Mt. Bachelor in about 30 minutes.  And for a truly unique adventure, the Paulina Plunge is a Sunriver guided mountain bike tour that includes waterfalls and gorgeous natural rock water slides. But really, your favorite activity might just be lounging on the patio listening to the birds or cuddled around the fire with mugs of hot cocoa!

Come explore the popular La Pine area at this relaxing and private Central Oregon vacation rental!

Very comfortable cabin in a great location. The views are beautiful and our dog loved the access to nature without having to worry about cars or bothering other people.  We really enjoyed our stay!

We enjoyed the privacy and beauty of the 40 acres. The short hike to The Fall River was an added bonus.  Wish we had known to bring float tubes!

With a private hot tub, furnished deck, and all the comforts of home, this cozy and modern Sunriver vacation rental cabin makes a fantastic family getaway in Sunriver! Spend your days on the golf course or swimming at SHARC (eight passes are included) before returning for a barbecue on the deck or quiet night around the fireplace.

In the warmer months, you'll flock to the outdoor deck. Fully enclosed, the space has a four-person dining set topped with a shade umbrella, a gas grill, potted plants and flowers, and of course the relaxing hot tub. Younger guests will love to play in the grassy yard, and may even spot a neighboring deer wandering through.

Inside, this beautifully maintained vacation rental home is nicely appointed with new furnishings and updated appliances. The living area has soft red leather sofas arranged before a cozy gas fireplace surrounded by river rock, with a flat-screen cable TV with DVD player off to the side for movie nights. Each window has a twin-sized window seat beneath it, perfect for reading, napping, or even as sleeping spots for extra guests (another favorite with our young guests!).

The kitchen has all the major appliances (including dishwasher) you would expect, along with plenty of countertop gadgets such as blender, toaster, and coffee grinder that make preparing meals a breeze. The cabinets are stocked with pots and pans, dinnerware, serving dishes, glassware, and utensils. Grab a seat at the breakfast bar to chat with the chef, or gather around the four-person dining table for a family meal (or, head out to the sunny deck for al fresco dining!).

The upper level of this lovely vacation rental home has two bedrooms, one with a king bed and one with a queen, and a full bath with shower/tub combo. The home can accommodate up to six guests, though it is most comfortable for only four adults due to the unusual sleeping arrangements with the "window beds" downstairs. There is a half bath downstairs for everyone's convenience, and a washer/dryer to keep up with the laundry. The home also offers broadband Internet access, so staying connected to the office is easy.

Whether you're visiting with your family, planning a golf outing, skiing at nearby Mt. Bachelor in the winter, or simply want to relax among the pine trees and lounge in the hot tub, you'll feel right at home in this lovingly maintained Sunriver vacation rental cabin modern in beautiful Central Oregon!

**Please note, this home is by the active railroad tracks**

The price was right,  but the little things left this house wanting. The house was not comfortable: near the train tracks and no air conditioning, and had many minor faults, such as teflon pans that were worn out. The only saving  factor was a very good hot tub out back.

The house was a nice place until you look out back and see the railroad tracks 50 feet from the house. Our kids woke up scared every time the train passed, usually three times a night. During the day we were a bit worried about them being in the yard without supervision because the train. We have no complaints about the house.

This friendly little cabin will meet your needs for a fun escape. It is well furnished, with yummy red leather sofa and chair and comfortable beds.  The hot tub is the perfect temperature. It's a quiet location and yes, the train moves through but quietly and not between 11 pm and 5 am.  Honestly, I am a light sleeper and with ear plugs in I didn't even hear it. My friends in the bed closest to the tracks (the master bedroom) didn't even use earplugs and said it wasn't a problem

The is a very well maintained and well appointed home. The kitchen had everything we needed and our children especially loved the sleeping/reading nooks. We saw multiple critters in the back yard and enjoyed watching the Hummingbirds. The train tracks behind were a non-issue - just ensured the house windows on the track side were closed at night. Overall, a great experience and would highly recommend this property.

We stayed 2 nights in May to end the ski season & celebrate our 37th wedding anniversary. This home was just what we needed.  Nice home with everything you might need. Loved the little nooks for extra guests.

would  make a perfect get away for a girls trip !

What a cute, cozy and super friendly home. The moment we walked in it felt like home.

This home has a great feel - I idid feel like I was staying at a friend's home. The big windowlounge was a lovely place to read and watch the birds at the feeder and the squirrels trying to get INTO the feeders! Thank you for keeping them full.

Not a sun trap (for this sun lover), so would be a great winter spot to sit by the fire and enjoy the hot tub.

This little cottages great back it was in that little. We spent countless hours in the hot tub staring out at the stars watching nature scenes take place in front of our very eyes. My only request but it had nothing to do with the house, was if it wasn't raining. But even with the rain it almost created picturesque ambience that allowed us to refresh and revive ourselves. We created some happy family members here and that was our goal for this trip September.

We stayed at 8 Juniper for a mid-week family trip that I tacked onto a work obligation. I'm so glad that we did! We have two toddlers, and had a great time, loved the hot tub and the many nooks and crannies!

Enjoy views & soak in the hot tub at this pet-friendly home

Live life to the fullest at this gorgeous, updated Sunriver vacation rental. Pet-friendly and equipped with a private hot tub and accommodations for eight, it's a high desert paradise located at one of Central Oregon's most family-friendly resorts.

Sitting within views of the fairway at Woodlands Golf Course (bring your clubs!), this luxurious Sunriver Resort getaway also comes with access to the Sunriver Homeowners Aquatic and Recreation Center (SHARC), less than three miles away. Here, you'll have access to pools, picnic pavilions, family-friendly play areas, and more. For day trips, visit Mt. Bachelor (under 20 miles away) or Bend (just 18 miles north).

The three-bedroom, three-bathroom home is as impressive outside as it is inside. You'll be delighted by its antiques, which give a unique character to this recently revamped home.

Drenched in sun, the sprawling patio is pretty much made for an afternoon of lemonade sipping and socializing. Maybe you could go for a jog along Deschutes River trails and treat yourself to a refreshing cocktail on the deck?

Inside is a fully stocked gourmet kitchen that any chef will feel right at home in. The kitchen island is a perfect place to serve a casual pre-dinner cheese and fruit spread.

Family dining can be enjoyed at the large dining table or on the deck - it's all about how you want to spend your time together.

Two families or a group of eight friends would find this Sunriver Resort vacation home ideal. One couple can get a good night's sleep in the master bedroom, which includes a king-size bed. Another couple can take the room containing a queen-size bed, while three close pals can share a bunk with a double on the bottom and a twin on top. Lastly, you'll find a daybed in the study and a pull-out sofa in the loft.

Yep, there's a hot tub here, but if you want a little more warm, bubbly privacy, check out the jetted tub in the master bathroom! There are also two more bathrooms, so a full house of eight should have plenty of space.

Additional amenities include WiFi, a sound dock, and a private washer and dryer. Two dogs are welcome to come along, but please note that there is an additional pet fee. Plus, the spacious green grounds of the property would be lovely for a small wedding.

When you're not soaking in the private hot tub, you might want to get out on the green next door the Woodlands Golf Course or hike and bike Sunriver's miles and miles of paved trails. At SHARC, everyone can splash in the pools and play in the sand before refueling with a picnic lunch. While one day you may take a drive into nearby Bend or to Mt. Bachelor, the other could be spent hiking or horseback riding around the resort's trails close to the home.

This Central Oregon vacation rental at Sunriver Resort is a magnificent home away from home that any traveler would love to stay at!

You'll love your time at 13 Tokatee. The house is clean and the neighborhood is quiet. It was nice to have a large sunny porch to rest and relax. We turned on the outdoor speakers and took it easy.  Outside we spent our time watching the golfers pass by. The accommodations are comfortable and there is plenty of space. Our children had room to run and play without getting into trouble. It was nice to have grassy space to play, this is unlike many of the homes in Sunriver that are tucked into the dark trees.If your up for fun be sure to use the passes and spend some time at the SHARC.

Bachelor.

Your stay includes eight unlimited passes to SHARC, the new aquatic center, which offers swimming pools and tennis courts in the warmer months and tubing hills and play areas in the winter.

In warmer weather, the outdoor deck beckons with a gas grill for barbecuing and fresh mountain air to savor along with your morning coffee. In the winter, the private hot tub soothes sore muscles after a day spent skiing or snowboarding (ok, the hot tub feels pretty good in the summer, too!).

Unbeatable location for us.  This home is located among primarily residential properties, on the north end close to the river and away from the core Sunriver roads - so it is very quiet and private.  Super clean and very well appointed.  Multiple dvd/blu-ray players and flat screen tv's.  The master bedroom and bath are extremely spacious; great master shower and jetted tub.  Master bed is large and has a great mattress.  Hot tub was clean and in like-new condition.  Only considerations we would mention:  the home has a circular staircase which was fine for us but might be a concern for parents of young children, and two of the upstairs bedrooms are under the eaves/in alcoves, so are a little bit funky.  Again, not an issue for us at all but might be notable for some.

In all, a very nice and thoughtfully appointed home!  Great amenities.  The home is in great shape  (many Sunriver homes show their age in creaky floors, tired kitchens, bathrooms, etc - not the case here!) and the rental price was very reasonable/competitive.  Thanks for a wonderful stay!

We rented this house for four nights  in March and had a great time.  The large kitchen is well appointed (the panini press was a big  plus) and we had everything that we needed to prepare  multi-course meals. The living room is beautiful  and comfortable as are the two main bedrooms, especially the master suite and master bath. On the second floor,  the two  smaller bedrooms  are good for kids but maybe too small for adults. To top things off, we found this to be a great location for our dog. The tile flooring makes it easy to clean up any wet paw prints and there are multiple rugs to lay down on after running on the nearby paths. A+

The two small rooms upstairs were very cold. We were trying to get some heat by keeping the doors open. Also, the Cable Romote downstairs was missing. Towels were still getting dried up when we got there. The house was not very clean. The key lock box is broken, anybody can get the key, you dont need a code.

We enjoyed the open space and amenities in the house.  The two rooms with beds tucked into the walls were ingenious, though a bit chilly (we were there in November).  Loved how quiet the street was and proximity to the bike path and river.

Kitchen was well equipped and had lots of space for renter's food.

Beds were very comfy and the stoves in the the great room and master bedroom were excellent at putting out heat with a minimum of wood consumed.

The tile was wonderful as we brought our dog  and two children.  It made for very easy clean up of any wet foot prints.  :)

This home has one major problem - to access the upstairs you have to go up a narrow spiral staircase or you have to use a stairway accessed thru the garage. This is not ideal for young kids or elderly parents.

Just a few minor things but overall a great stay with my kids, grandkids and mom.

The home was very clean and well furnished, but the floor plan is very unusual and not the most practical. It worked for us because there were only four of us. Your company was very responsive and I would definitely use again for a rental property.

Excellent place to stay.  Very quiet, clean, excellent maintenance, accessible to the paths just outside the home.  We brought 2 teens and they were entertained as were we.   We hope to return again in the future.

We loved this house! Although not appropriate perhaps for families with young ones, it was perfect for our family of teens. Huge living area, well stocked kitchen, fabulous master bedroom and bath. It is a little further north within Sunriver than some places, but still very accessible to the river and bike paths. Very quiet location. Four bathrooms but only two showers necessitated a little bit of planning. We found it to be very charming and comfortable with lots of room to spread out and yet not get lost.

Very spacious, comfortable, and luxurious, we will definitely stay here again!

Perfect house for our family. Will definitely rent this property again.

Private hot tub, across the street from SHARC!

This spacious Sunriver vacation home has one of the best locations imaginable: just across the street from SHARC, the new state-of-the-art aquatic center! Spend your days swimming and splashing in the year-round pools, then dry off in the evenings by the crackling fireplace in the great room; if you still haven't had enough of the water, head out to the back deck where your own private hot tub awaits.

The four-bedroom home emulates a mini mountain lodge and is wonderful for groups, with an open great room featuring a rustic floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, vaulted ceilings, and large picture windows looking out over the pine trees in the yard. There are plenty of comfortable couches and chairs to lounge on while playing a rousing game of Monopoly or chatting over a bottle of wine.

At mealtimes, sit down to a hearty breakfast or homemade dinner at the log-hewn dining table near the fireplace. The updated kitchen has modern appliances, counter tops and all the cooking gear needed to prepare meals for a group, along with the all-important dishwasher so you can spend your time relaxing with your loved ones instead of scrubbing pots and pans!

The first level of the two-story home has three spacious bedrooms with beds dressed in cozy quilts for chilly evenings. Two bedrooms host a queen-sized bed each, while the master reveals a comfy king within a log bed frame and sliding door access to the forest outside. Upstairs, a sleeping loft has four twin beds so younger guests can stage weekend-long sleepovers! One full bath with a shower/tub combos,and one bathroom with shower make morning routines easy even with a full house. With nearly 2,000 square feet of living space, this getaway is perfect for a dual-family vacation.

Outside, the shady evergreens surrounding the home offer a sense of peacefulness and seclusion, despite the truly outstanding location of this getaway. You'll be able to walk less than half a mile to the Village at Sunriver, with its dining, shopping, and wintertime ice skating rink. Of course, golf courses, bike paths, horseback rides, the Deschutes River and all of Sunriver's other wonderful activities are easily within reach!

Overall, we had a great experience staying at this house in Senriver.  Next time I spend time in the bend area, I will certainly return the 7 Puma ln.

A wonderful winter retreat in Sunriver! We enjoyed jogging on the Sunriver paths, skiing at Mt. Bachelor, and soaking in the hot tub! We loved the layout of 7 Puma Lane, it was a great place for a weekend getaway!

We have rented multiple times with vacasa and have been very pleased thanks for your help

Very fun location for a group of friends looking to Ski! Hot tub was big, everything was clean, and the location was close to mountain!

This house has a great lift space for the kidos to play. There is not a door to the space but our kids eventually fell asleep it just took awhile. We had a great time in this house.

the location is very nice. Close to Sharc Aquatic Center and the village shopping.

We really enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect!!! We were pleasantly surprised that there were enough bikes for all of us to ride!!!!

The house was perfect for our family, 2 adults, 4 kids, and sonny our small dog. House was clean and comfortable and close to village and the Shark water park. If you're looking for a place where you can just relax, barbecue, and enjoy time with you're family, this house is a  good choice.

Stayed here with kids and older grandkids.  Worked great for us. As for the train, grandpa loved it but it flies by really fast so watch the kiddos and dogs.  Kids were able to easily bikes to SHARC and we all used the bike paths a lot!  The SHARC passes were a big draw for our family.   Property needs some updating but for our needs, we were pleased and would do it again.  (Bring your own frying pans)

The train is about 100 feet away. Not much sleep had this stay. It was clean though.

We were happy with this property! It is close to train tracks and trains ran through late at night and the bbq did not work well but other than that it was clean and peaceful! It was worth the money! It was off season so we did not use the Shark passes but we want to plan another trip in the summer at this location. It was only 15 min drive to Bend which was also a huge plus!

My wife and I recently stayed in this property.  Other than the train tracks that feel as though they ran through the back yard making for very loud trains passing through the property, sometimes all hours of the night, we had no other complaints.

The house was clean and well prepared for our arrival.  It was well furnished with all the basic living and cooking items to make it seem homely ans comfortable.  There are a ton of things to do in and around Sun River and we will be back soon!

The house was clean and roomier than expected,  however it was also closer to the train tracks than expected and yes, they do run at night.   Other than the train,  the location was close to the village and sharc, and it is right on the Pac Crest course.   There are areas of Sunriver that will be more quiet and away from traffic noises.

Overall, a very nice, cozy place. Had a slight issue with hot tub, but one quick call and was handled. Enjoyed our stay.

Watch your kids and dogs at this place, tracks are about 20-30 feet from the back deck.  Woke most of our group two to three times nightly for 1-3 minutes of screeching metal.

My all adult family of 8 people really liked 5 Butternut. We were looking for a cheaper rental and a great value. We got just that. The hot tub was on the fritz for a little bit but luckily the handy fellows in our party fixed it right up. The most negative comment I heard most about the house was the comfort of a few of the beds. The living room is a little small for 8 people but we made it work by pulling the dining room table chairs over for cards and fun. The  house is indeed a little closer to the railroad tracks than it looks on the map. We heard it several times, especially during the night. But we are a pretty easy going group so it didn't bug us too much. Overall this was a great value for the price, especially compared to some of the pricier places in Sunriver. I would stay here again as long as we brought a few extra mattress pads for some of the beds and our own frying pans :) Thanks 5 Butternut!

This was our families first stay at Sunriver and we really enjoyed it. The home was nice and had plenty of room and sleeping for the six of us. It was with in easy walking distance to the SHARC as well as the village shops. It is also really close to the railroad tracks, which was a little loud the first night but we didnt notice much after that and the kids had fun counting how many cars each one had. over all we had a great first time here and would definitely stay here again.

Felt like we paid way too much to stay for a week in what we started calling 'the cabin'.  If we had been camping, it would have been great.  It would have made the trip awesome if we had been comfortable in the home we rented rather than miserable.

If you don't have high expectations this is your place.VERY dated and in need of tender loving care with lots of paint and a better kitchen.Lots of little things that need to be fixed. Loved the close location to the Sharc..Beautiful surroundings and as usual Sunriver resort area is outstanding.

My husband and I stayed here with my parents (grandma and granpa)  and our 1 and 1/2 year old son and our black lab.  We had a great time!  The property is very close to SHARQ and the sunriver mall. We were nervous about the train... it never woke us and our son loved watching it go by... but we did not let him play outside as there is no fence between the yard and tracks.  This ended up being a non issue as he had plenty of oppertunity to play, swim, walk, and bike every day.  This was a plain  little vacation house but we had a very relaxing and fun trip!

This home isn't super fancy but has a fabulous location to the new SHARC, easy to walk to and from and we really enjoyed the train out back as entertainment for our kids, plus the hot tub is great since it isn't hidden behind a fence.

Excellent home and location for a gathering. We wish we could have stayed a little longer!

We stayed a weekend and did not want to leave. The retreat has everything you need from kitchen supplies and Recreational items to an amazing view of Mount Bachelor and relaxing atmosphere. The beds are beautiful as well as comfortable. This retreat was a great p!ace for our family of 10 and even our dogs were welcome! We definitely will be back.

Wonderful and relaxing vacation.  The view was breath taking. The house was stocked with everything we needed and more.  There was hardly a need to go into Sunriver except for groceries, a little snooping around the mall and an occasional cocktail.  All of us enjoyed ourselves immensely. Even the soon to be three year old!

We really couldn't have been more happy with this rental home. The river in the backyard was epic!! The kitchen was completely stocked with every appliance. We didn't have one complaint about the place. Plan to return every year.

Our annual family trip was perfectly suited for this home.  The young kids loved the huge yard and tossing pine cones into the river.  Because they go to bed early we couldn't utilize the loft area beds at night, but they loved reading and playing on them during the day.  The home is extremely well stocked and every detail has been thought about. The road is very close to the back of the home, but you never hear it inside. The Vacasa team was also amazing to work with!

This is house was truly amazing and spacious.  We planned this family vacation for my husband and I and our kids, grandchildren, & two grand-dogs.  We had plenty of room for everyone and having the yard and dog run was great.  We thought we would need a lot of things for the kitchen but the house was fully stock and we did not need half of what we brought.  I would highly recommend this house and the staff were great about a couple of changes we made.

This is house was spotless when we arrived and was really beautifully appointed. Plush towels, great kitchen with an excellent selection of pots and pans,  utensils, and glassware. The owners even decorated a small Christmas tree in the entry way  to welcome us. When we needed a handyman to fix the hot water heater he was there within the hour. We had a wonderful holiday.

This place was the perfect gathering place for our family coming from Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Nevada.  It was a great place to get together and enjoy family time.  Beautiful property, relaxing home, great for adults, kids and dogs.  You helped us start what we hope will be a new family tradition.  Very comfortable home with every amenity.  Other than bringing food you had everything else we could have wanted.  Fully stocked kitchen, amazing sheets,comfortable beds, great accomindations.  This place is easily a 5 star place.  We loved being near the river and the view of Bachelor.  We thought we were in a Hallmark holiday movie.  Thank you for everything.  We have been forever spoiled.  I am afraid no other place will compare to this one.  It was perfect.  Thank you.

My husband and I rented this retreat as a mini vacation for us, our children and grandchildren. It was perfect for all ten of us. The lodge had plenty of space to allows us all to spread out or enjoy each others company without tripping over ourselves. The back deck and yard were outstanding with plenty of room for the grandchildren to play the many games we planned.  The views from this house are priceless, You can't help but relax when you have a beautiful view of the river with Mt. Bachelor in the background. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you could possibly need to prepare any meal. We are already planning another trip and hope to stay at the lodge again!

Our family really enjoyed being able to walk to the village and the Condo itself is beautiful. The kids enjoyed the bonus of playing in the pool at the SHARC after a day on the slopes of Mt. Bachelor and we liked the adults only hot tub.

We enjoyed using the bikes that were at rhe condo. We really liked the furnishings and "feel" of the unit. The air conditioner was a nice amenity.

We had a great time at this condo. Location was perfect for our little ones and the fenced patio and great lawn behind the condo were a hit. It didn't feel like we were in a condo as we never felt lacking for space. The SHARC passes and bikes were absolute gems and we used them often. Also, we visited when the weather was very hot--90s and above--and before arriving we were nervous about the lack of AC (as the description mentions). However, we were beyond happy to realize the unit had a WONDERFUL air conditioner in the wall of the dining room. We closed all shades, windows, etc. in the late morning and the condo cooled off right away. It was perfect! We will be returning and can't say enough about this great space!

This condo was perfect for this  married couple with a our Dog, My husband loved that we were right in the Village walking distance to everything.  We used the bikes which are well maintained.  Tip- it would  saved us a phone call to Vacasa if the "welcome book" stated where the bikes are located in this unit. We of course figured it out  right after we had called. Very nice remodel, the bathroom has the exact same tile as our home (great taste!) thank you!

My husband, 24 year old daughter & I wanted to ski one day & just relax together.

This was perfect, comfortable & conveniently located close to the store & Starbucks!!  Played games, cooked dinner & just relaxed.  We would stay here again.  Much more room for up to 8 or 9 - but only 1 bathroom!

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this property.  Five adults and one toddler had plenty of room to spread out.  We came for a conference and appreciated coming 'home' every night rather than to a single room.  It was spacious, clean, and had lots of games for kids and adults alike.  The Sunriver pathway system  is right out the back door.  We used it for running, walking, and biking. There is so much to see and do in the area that we are already thinking about bringing our family here for a vacation.  We highly recommend this property.

We had a wonderful stay at 15 Modoc. The house was very clean upon arrival and very comfortable.   I would definetly stay at this house again in the future!

Great location. Great house for the family, just needs some cleanliness in the master bedroom and bath. Wish this house was equipped with AC for hot summer days as it got too warm in the house even with the fans. The house was well equipped in the kitchen, it had just about everything you needed to cook and bake. They had bikes and air hockey in garage, which was great for the kids.

The house is very well equipped, especially the kitchen, one of the best we've rented.  The house is very clean and well maintained.  The bunk bed room ceiling light needs a new bulb, otherwise everything was is working order, a great place to stay.

We had a blast staying in this house with friends for a ski weekend. Even though the conditions were crummy the first day, we had fun staying in, watching movies, playing games and catching up. The house was perfect size and very well stocked. Perfect home away from home!

We visited Sun River over New years and although the resort was crowded the location of this condo was very quiet  It was close to the trails and a beautiful view of Mt. Bachelor.  The two drawbacks are that you can only burn dura logs in the fireplace and there is no internet in the room.  We got by however :).  The vacasa staff was extremely helpful and responsive when we had questions.

Perfect for two and a pet...great location

Great little spot for 2-4.  Loved the free SHARC passes, saved us lots of money!  Felt very safe in secured building.  Thank you we will be coming back!

Super close to Great Hall where conventions take place.

Great place, 2 of us stayed, perfect size and clean, with view balcony! It is up stairs, should know that!

Cute condo and just right for my granddaughter, myself, and our little doggie.  Nice and quiet, close to many walking paths.  The TV went out on our 2nd day, but that was the fault of the cable company, which was revamping.  It was actually good for us as we could play games and have more fun!

Unit was convenient to Sunriver activities, clean but small for studio.  Kitchen was very small, price was rather high for size of unit.  Needs upgraded TV.

Perfect location makes it all! The property appearance was exactly as shown on photos- outdated. The unit #13 is spacious an has vaulted celling. The bed was comfortable, all appliances worked well. If you don't over expect, it is a good place to stay. There is a lot to do in Sunriver outside of you unit.

In all, it was a good deal. The winter weather came in for our spring ski. It was wonderful time. The shoping area around Sunrive is very nice. .

This was our first experience at Sunriver.  We're new from the east coast.  Frankly, we came for the slopes...  just needed a place to crash.

Within a day we knew that we wanted to find out more about Sunriver.  Well, one can't ski all day, float down rivers and mash up new snow and still have time to study the wonderful and intricate place that Sunriver has become.  So we'll just have to come back.  Again and again!

The location is great. The unit needs serious attention before I would give a solid recommendation to staying here. It wasn't necceasrly a dirter place, just outdated. The couch must be 15 years old and it shows. Same with the carpet and other furnishings. If you are looking for elegance, I wold contnue searching. If you just need a place to stay with a dog and don't plan on being in the room much, then it would suffice. By the way No air-conditioning in the place. However a fan was provided and we used the by the sliding glass door and cooled the place overnight, making the next day much more bearable

The property was very warm when we arrived. No air conditioning. The living room area was quite roomy but the kitchen was not adequate. Two small burners and a bar size sink just didn't cut it even though we only cooked breakfast. Very unhandy! The entry way hall and stairs were not very clean but the room was okay except for some debri on the floors. I felt that the price was high for what we received.

This cheery three-bedroom Sunriver vacation rental condo makes a wonderful wallet-friendly getaway in the heart of Sunriver! With a prime location right across the street from the Village's shops and restaurants, the condo is equally well-suited for a laid-back girls' getaway, fun-filled family vacation, guys' golf retreat, or wintertime skiing weekend.

While the surrounding area is full of wide open spaces and outdoor recreation, you'll be staying in the heart of all the action with the Village at Sunriver right across the street! Spend a leisurely afternoon browsing the boutiques and visiting the microbrewery, or wake up early to rent bicycles for a day exploring the 35  miles of paved trails throughout the resort.

The condo offers all the comforts of home and has plenty of space for up to six guests. After a long day spent playing tennis, kayaking the Deschutes River, or simply shopping in the Village, everyone can gather in the living room for a movie night before the cable TV with DVD player.

Walk across the street to dine at one of the nearby restaurants, or prepare your own meals in the fully-equipped kitchen. You'll find all the pots and pans, dinnerware, and cooking utensils needed, plus the all-important dishwasher for easy clean-up. The dining table seats six, and there are two stools at the breakfast bar so guests can sip a glass of wine and chat with the chef. On warmer evenings, head out to the back deck for a barbecue around the gas grill or to dine at the patio table in the fresh air.

Each of the three bedrooms has a comfortable queen bed, and there is one full bath for smooth morning routines. There is a washer/dryer, which makes it easy to keep up with wet bathing suits and well-worn hiking clothes.

And you will want that bathing suit! Staying at the condo entitles you to six complimentary passes to SHARC, the brand-new aquatic center with swimming pools, lazy river, tennis courts, and hot tub less than a mile from your front door. The surrounding national forest is full of hiking trails, fishing holes, and kayaking runs; in the winter, Mt. Bachelor is just twenty minutes away for all your skiing and snowboarding needs. Of course, the resort and its surrounding area have a handful of excellent golf courses, with the Meadows being the closest to the condo.

More adventuresome types can book a guided fishing expedition or whitewater rafting trip at one of the trusted outfitters, while the young-at-heart will love playing a round of mini-golf or hopping in the bumper cars. In the winter, take a spin around the ice-skating rink, followed by a cappuccino at the Italian cafe. And when you're finally ready to leave all the activity behind, you only need to walk across the street to your private Central Oregon getaway.

We were happy with our stay in Sunrver, but would not stay in this same condo again.

We stayed at this unit in the very beginning of May, which is the end of the off-season, so everything was very quiet and peaceful. The mall is directly across the parking lot, and we did hear a couple of early morning deliveries, but nothing major. The plus side of the location is that restaurants, the grocery store, and most importantly Goody's are just a 2 minute walk away. This unit has been nicely remodeled and tastefully decorated, and we especially enjoyed the wooded view out the window. The balcony also gets great afternoon sun.

The condo is great. It's right by the entrance and the village so you don't have to travel far for food, drinks or bike rentals. Overall the space was great and quiet. Unfortunately the Sunriver website does not do a good job of making you aware of activities or restaurants that are closed for renovations (one of the golf courses, the driving range, a few restaurants). We still had plenty to do but would have liked to know ahead of time what options weren't available so we could plan ahead.

Being so close to the market has its great benefits. But one thing that was very disturbing was that the early morning deliveries noise for the marketplace. Loud trucks and noises at very early morning hours.

Pros- location, walking distance to SR village, easy bike to Sharc, functioning outdoor grill, bike racks, washer/dryer, full amenity kitchen, coffee filters and coffee maker, cooling fans in all rooms, hot water for showers, free wifi and cable tv, Free Sharc passes

Cons- carpet needs replacing, delivery trucks could be heard early in the morning if we kept windows open (just closed them and able to sleep through it), only 1 full bathroom, 2nd shower was in laundry room and cramped.

We loved staying at this house. It was literally right next to everything!  The only negative about this rental is the lack of air conditioning. It was very hot at night, and difficult to sleep, even with several fans running throughout the house. Other than that, we were very pleased with the location, the information provided, and the amenities.

Great location and space for the price.

Location, location, location.  The Abbot House condos are a two minute walk from the country store and are within very easy walking distance of many eateries and shops.  It was so easy to grab a bike rental and take off to explore the rest of the resort.  That said, those looking for quiet of the outdoors might not appreciate the early morning delivery noise, but we were able to get past that.  The view of the trees out the slider window was nice.  The condo was very clean and very comfortable.  I got the feeling the management was trying hard to give the customers a good stay.  The place worked very well for us, a family of 4.  Plenty of room.  We hope this condo will be available for us again when we choose to have another Sunriver stay.

Small, tastefully decorated unit with small outside balcony.  It is dark but nicely kept up.

Love Sunriver and the Abbot House condo was nice and quite adequate for our needs. However, while the location seemed ideal by being next to the Village shopping area, the bedrooms overlook the deliver area for the grocery store.  Deliveries begin at 3:30 in the morning and continue through the night thereafter.

This condo was perfect for our girlfriends weekend! It was everything we needed and very comfortable. It was a short walk (across the street) from the village. Unfortunately the refridgeration machinery for the grocery store runs 24/7 and a 4AM delivery one morning woke us up. Had to keep our bedroom windows closed all night.

I am not a complainer and overall, my wife and I had a WONDERFUL 5 year anniversary visit to Sunriver, OR., but Vacasa has a few small, but KEY areas to work on for me to recommend them to friends/family, let alone use them again.

Please feel free to contact me and let me know if you have made any resolutions to the issues that I brought up.

The design of the Tennis Village units (2BR, 2BA on 2 levels w/kitchen, dining room and living room) is perfect for a family, or for two couples.

So close to the Great Hall and Homestead. But we were able to very comfortably sleep and accommodate 6 of us .  The kitchen was well stocked and furnished, including outside grill. Even got an email when the unit was ready at 11:00 am so we could check in early. Absolutely no complaints. Would definitely recommend staying there.

12 Tennis Village had everything we needed and more! Just steps away from the sage spring spa, it was easy to sign up for a 6am fitness class and return again for a soak in hot tub. The kitchen was well organized and stocked with everything we needed for the meals we made and they even had a little booster seat for our 2 year old. Perfection. Thank you owners of 12 Tennis and Vacasa!

Another website had same condo for $50 more a night.  The condo was beautiful and just perfect for our vacation. Will definitely come back specifically thru Vacasa!!!

This charming, one-bedroom loft Sunriver vacation rental is stocked with everything you'll need for a restful and adventure-filled resort getaway! This cute and welcoming  retreat is filled with books, a wonderful wood-buring fireplace for toasty nights by the fire, and of course, access to all of Sunriver Resort's amenities like SHARC (the Sunriver Homeowners Aquatic & Recreation Center), miles of hiking and biking trails, horse stables, tennis courts, and more!

This location at Sunriver Resort is just over 15 miles from Bend, where you can spend the day exploring the shops and galleries along Wall and Bond streets, check out the local brewery scene, or spend an afternoon wandering through exhibits at the High Desert Museum. Sisters (38 miles north) is also an option for a  fun day trip, and in winter the drive to Mt. Bachelor only takes about 30 minutes. You can even catch a shuttle right from Sunriver Resort (a nominal fee applies).

Your woodland cabin is a pleasantly-updated, rustic getaway with exposed wood beams, wood paneling, and a warm and inviting interior throughout. Come back from skiing or hiking to a spread of appetizers out on the coffee table and a glass of wine in front of the fire. Entertainment options here include WiFi, cable TV, a DVD player, and a stereo - plenty of choices for when you're not out taking advantage of all of Sunriver's activities.

The compact but fully-stocked kitchen includes all major appliances (including a dishwasher), as well as gadgets like a coffee grinder and a toaster. Make a filling brunch before you head off on a nature hike or sleigh ride and at night, dinner can be at the large wooden dining table, if you want to stay in. Out on the deck, you'll also have a gas grill for sunny afternoon, outdoor feasts.

With large beds for two couples, the sofa and twin bed can accommodate up to two kids. There is a half-bath in addition to the full bathroom for added convenience, and a stacked washer and dryer in case you need to do laundry during your vacation.

Set on over 3,000 acres in Oregon's high desert, Sunriver Resort is filled with activities for every member of your family! There are pools, hot tubs, and saunas at SHARC, four golf courses, including the award-winning Crosswater, 26 tennis courts, 40 miles of paved, multi-use trails, and the restaurants and shops of Sunriver Village Mall.

Mt. Bachelor is close enough to spend your days skiing and snowboarding, and if you just want to stay close to the resort, you can take a unique one-horse open sleigh ride, complete with a festive, Victorian sleigh and gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains and Sunriver Meadow. It's about an hour's drive to Fort Rock State Natural Area if you want to do some rock-climbing or just hike around this gorgeous natural area. But really, you may just spend all of your time at the resort - hiking, biking, and relaxing in your cozy cabin in the woods.

Plan an unforgettable Sunriver adventure with a stay at this Central Oregon vacation rental for fun in the sun, a skiing retreat, or just a family getaway to enjoy deluxe resort amenities.

This house was perfect for our family of 3. Very clean and cozy. We can't wait to go back. Our only complaint....our trip was too short! :)

The furnishings were a bit dated but it is a great little cabin in a very quiet area.  The barbeque was great.  Also there were plenty of kitchen supplies and cookware.  I would stay here again.

My brother's family and my family NEEDED a weekend away. On a whim, we selected this charming cabin. It was absolutely perfect.

When my brother was unpacking groceries, he kept exclaiming "They have ..." A wok, more pans than we'll ever need, .... I must've heard 3 or 4 exclamations of all the kitchen equipment the cabin had.

Thank you so much for the use of the Sharc passes. The kids loved the indoor pool. They want to go back after May so they can try the lazy river. We were too early in the season for it to be open.  But, they got to play in the snow which was the whole reason for the trip.

The surrounding area was lovely. We even saw 2 deer Sunday morning as we were packing the car to leave.

Thank you so much for sharing the cabin with us.

The cabin was a perfect spring break/Easter getaway for our family of four.  Very quiet.  Small kitchen is well equipped.  The kids (5 & 11) enjoyed sharing the upstairs loft area.  The early April weather was sunny with highs around 45.  We spent the day on our bikes looping around Sunriver, stopping to play - Ft. Rock Park, northern Sunriver at Deschutes River, over the bridge & back, Nature Center, across the meadow, dessert/beers at the Lodge, SHARC rock climbing wall, Brewery for dinner, home again.  Next time we'll loop the southern end of Sunriver.  We were comfortable in the sun with gloves and medium weight jackets.  Clouds rolled in, so we skipped our planned trip to the observatory that night.

Our total experience  was one of the best experience  we have had at Sunriver. ...even the resort didn't  compare this time! We can wait to come back. This home worked great for my husband and I  on our trip. It was a little  dark in the home and smelled a little  like  a camp fire but it was cozy and clean...we would definitely  recommend  this  cabin at Sunriver  and booking with Vacasa...it was super easy easy  working  with them...they were friendly  and resourceful!

The cabin was perfect - so clean and well stocked, VERY comfortable.  The towels were so soft and the beds very comfy.  We had one small complaint and the Vacasa staff immediately fixed the issue.  We will return!

A nice place to stay and very comfortable.  We loved the rustic atmosphere and considered it our ski chalet in January.  The huge fireplace really makes it cozy.  The house also backs up to a green way  with bike-walking path area with no houses immediately behind.  Fort Rock park is just a few minutes away.  It was very quiet this time of year in Sun River.

This cabin had everything we needed! Super cozy and was in a nice quiet spot. Well cared for property. Only thing missing... The dishwasher was broken.  Not a huge deal but it did mean we were washing dishes a lot to keep on top of them so we didn't have a ton to do before we checked out. Overall we'd definitely stay here again.

We enjoyed our stay and the hot tub. It is nice and big for  6 people and was roomy. The rooms were big.

Older house, outdated and worn out bathrooms.  Toilets were very  low as if made for a child.   Kitchen utensils and dishes were old and mismatched and limited quantity.

Wonderful lodging.  Could use updated shower heads.  Also the master bed mattress needs to be replaced, we sank into the middle so slept in side room instead.  suggest getting knife sharpener for house as well.  Thank you for everything

We loved Sunriver and my grandkids particularly loved the hot tub.   A very comfortable house, in pretty good condition except for the carpets.  We realize they were vacuumed, but need a thorough cleaning.

Pine Needle 5 is a roomy, comfortable, well kept home, in a quiet area that is still close to most of the south end attractions of Sunriver.  Our family has come back to it at least three times now and plan to use it again.

There were 6 adults and felt we had ample space.  Enjoyed having the bikes and Sharc passes was an extra bonus.

We stayed at Number 5 Pine Needles in Sun River, and while there were a few sprucing up things the place could have used, overall, we were quite happy with it.  It had a wonderful TV and Cable package and good wi-fi, lots of room, you got to park in the garage to unload, which was very nice, and the kitchen had a lot of very useful kitchen tools that made it very easy to cook.  it was very quiet -- so quiet in fact that the neightbors called the police on us because they didn't know anyone had rented the place.  The Sun River Police -- the two times we encountered them -- were great.  One helped us find the place, and the one that came to check the place after a neigbor reported "something suspicious" there was very polite and considerate.  It could easily and comfortably accomodate a small group, with dishes, glasses, and cookware enough to keep a group fed.

Loved biking by the river, bird watching and sitting in the hot tub.  We were two grandparents, two parents and two children and the house was just right for us.  The children loved the indoor pools, grandparents liked the shopping area and parents liked  the brew pub,  We had a great time.

We loved our stay on Pine Needle in Sun River!  Lots to do in the area and we could easily have spent more than the three nights we did. The SHARC passes that come with the rental unit were very useful. Tennis courts were fairly close and if you golf, one of the golf courses is nearby.  We loved the sunset bike rides along the path by the river (6 bikes in the garage meant we could ALL go for rides together).  The river path is very accessible to the Pine Needle house.  The hot tub was a welcome treat as well.  The home was clean and well maintained.  We'll definitely return.

Everything was just great. The property location was perfect for us, the house and hot tub were very clean and it had everything we needed. There was one window in the main bedroom that would not close, it was opened when we arrived and the house also could use a couple more frying pans. Other than that, it was perfect...

Nice place, very dated but still nice.  Loads of room for 8 people

It was a relaxing break. The house was cute and the kitchen was clean. The beds were cozy. I would rent this place again, except we missed not taking our two little dogs. No pets!!!  But, my grand daughter loved being close to the Ice cream store!!!

What a convenient location! And having SHARC passes included was a nice savings. Thank you!

This is the fourth Abbot house unit we've been in. We stay in this building because family owns one of the units and we want to be near them. Most of the units have a somewhat cavelike feel because of the way they were built.

This year, we weren't able to get a pet-friendly unit, so we went for Abbot House 1 because it had more bedrooms and more than one bathroom (SO MUCH NICER!). This unit was much more up to date and spacious than the other units we've stayed in. Lots of windows, 3 entrances and plenty of room for our 4 adults and 2 children. The back patio was perfect with access to lots of snow for our little ones to play in.

Also, you can't beat Abbot House's location for convenience to the Village and grocery market. It's so nice not to have to strap our little kids into their carseats to go everywhere. We pulled them around on a sled and they were thrilled.

As much as we love our little doggy, we'll likely opt to leave him at home again and stay in this unit.

Our family stayed here for a visit with our son whose in a local firefighter program and goes to COCC. We had all the comforts from home and wonderful family time. Close to everything.

We enjoyed our stay & would stay here again.  Our condo was clean, convenient to the Village,  very homey & restful.  Plenty of supplies in the kitchen.

Every thing was fine except: The group above was unbearably noisey. All hours of the night(s), stomping around, throwing things, running washing machine all hours, We couldn't get much sleep and I had to get up early each morning playing in the tennis tournament.

This place was well appointed and comfortable for our family of three, even had a third BR that we didn't use. We appreciated the TV's, though cable malfunctioned in the snow; and the kitchen was well appointed for cooking our meals in. Views out into the trees made for a peaceful setting, even with one facing a road; we just closed the curtain at night. We liked being close to the market, just a walk across the street and through the parking lot, and driving to SHARC wasn't bad, especially since we could change there afterward. Furniture and beds were comfortable, and all in all, the roomy condo was just right for some good family time and just a 20 minute drive to Mt. Bachelor.

I stayed in this condo with 2 girlfriends for 3 nights. It was perfect for the 3 of us, with 3 queen beds each in its own room, and two full bathrooms, and washer/dryer. Nicely appointed kitchen with awesome picture window. Comfy family room with mini stereo and large tv. Nice little back patio with table and chairs and 5 bikes. Right on the wonderful bike path! It is an end bottom unit so has nature view out the back and side with lots of trees. We saw deer out back in the mornings. It was very quiet in the area. You do hear a few footsteps from the upstairs condo but it wasn't a big deal, and you did not hear any voices or other noise...must be well insulated. The location is perfect for walking to the Village shops and restaurants. Sharc and the Lodge aren't far either. We could have stayed a lot longer and found plenty to do!

Staying right next to the Village Mall was great! Making meals was easy with the grocery store so close and it was nice having a kitchen.  We loved being able to ride the Cruiser bikes provided around all the wonderful Sunriver bike paths (a bike path picks up right outside the condo!).

The only downfall were the upstairs neighbors!

Great support from Vacasa!!!!!

This was a really great  condo! I wish we could have stayed longer. My friend who has a dog stayed in unit 3 - also managed by Vacasa - While we were there we used the  cruiser bikes to enjoy the trails. We also took in the Sunriver Mudslinger event! It was a perfect spring day!

We had a great stay at Abbot House Lane #1!  The layout and size was perfect for our family of four.  Our kids loved staying so close to the village mall and the bike paths are easily accessible.  The condo has been obviously remodeled and is very clean and comfortable.  We hope to stay there again.  Our only complaint is the noise from the unit upstairs, although I guess that is to be expected to some extent in a condo.  Overall, condo was NICE!

No 1 Abbott house was a great rental choice.  The unit was very clean, nice furniture, nice bikes, our daughter loved the retro one.  The location was very convenient to the village.  We would stay at property again.. Thank You,

Nice property - good location, well apointed and perfectly comfortable. Only issue is that you can hear occupants of upstairs condo walking around - thats kind of annoying.

Great location. The bikes were all in good condition. Will definately stay here again.

We were very happy with the house.  The only downside was the last two days someone with small children were in the condo upstairs and they have wooden floors so the noise was distracting.

The house was clean.  The only problem we had, which was a memory maker.  Our grandson got .stuck in the bathroom because the locking mechanism on the door didn't work properly. The manager was wonderful and came over to assist.

We would suggest this vacation spot to anyone.  The high desert museum, the lava caves, biking, swimming, the village it was all wonderful.  Thanks for the memory maker.

We would recommend VACASA to all.

Very close to the Village, the Lodge, the SHARC, etc.  Only noise was upstairs neighbors, but only for a few minutes each morning.  Spacious 3 bedroom, 2 bath.  Great kitchen and laundry in the unit.  Used the grill to cook.  Partial A/C does a fantastic job.  Was in the high 80's our entire trip.  Always comfortable  inside.  Beware...there is no internet access in this unit.  There are plenty of free hot spots around the Village.

The place was clean and location was nice and close to the village however, it is way too noisy and my husband and I and our son did NOT get much sleep. The price wasn't too bad but I would pay extra money to have my own house next time.

Very convenient condo for events @ Sunriver Resort.  Close to stores and restaurants.

I've heard about Sunriver for a while now but didn't know where to stay where everything was, etc.  My interaction with Vacasa was flawless and very easy. Our condo was in a prime spot - walking distance to the Village!  (Also because it was in prime spot, there was a lot of foot traffic in/around the condo too).  I agree with the other comment of how you could easily hear the folks upstairs moving about, but it was quite ok with us.  We would love to go back and spend more time in Sunriver and we will definitely use Vacasa again :)

We loved this place! After renting 3 different places in sunriver, this was our favorite!  It seemed to have everything we even thought we needed including stuff for my 2 year old. Nicely furnished and very clean! I only deducted a star because of the noise from the 2nd floor. I expected it for an older condo, but it was still loud when people were walking around at 5:30am :(

It was great, I love that it came with 3 bikes, helmets and a bike trailer for the kiddos.  The pool passes were great too...we used them a few times despite the snow and weather conditions!

The only negative was the water dripping down from the upstairs AC onto the deck - but we had a fantastic stay thanks!

Nice place to stay in Sunriver...very close to everything!

The house doesn't look like much in the pictures, but the layout was perfect for our family.  The living room and dining area are part of a big common area with a wall full of windows.  We loved all the outdoor activity, but even while playing games or eating our meals at the house, we could still enjoy the wooded feeling of the outdoors with those great windows!  Everything was clean and in working order and the house is in a great location.

Super cold, but they had plenty of firewood to keep us warm.

Property was as described and very clean.  Easy to follow instructions for check-in/out.  Rental agency was great to work with & immediately answered our questions before & during stay.  Fireplace in good condition & lots of wood available.  Kitchen is filled with everything needed but leaves minimal room to put things away.  However, lots of room in laundry room & dining room for overflow!  Is on the main road so, it might be a bit noisy for deck activities during the busy season but did not bother us & not heard while inside.  Overall a great rental & exceeded our expectations.

Very nice home - fit the needs of our small family very well. Loved all the big windows - lots of natural light in the home. Also enjoyed being so close to Fort Rock Park - our boy could easily ride his bike over by himself and play. Beware the coffeemaker - does not turn off automatically!

Staff was great to work with!

We had a wonderful stay in your home!! Everything was clean and well stocked.  We loved the open and spacious layout of the home. Lots of light with the many windows.  There is nice space between all the bedrooms.  Loved the size of the dining room table and granite counter tops throughout the home.  Thank you, we will definitely return!

The Terrell family.

It was well stocked but there was no plastic wrap, foil or paper towels which would be a nice addition. Otherwise very pleased and it was well represented. Love the option for late checkout. That made our last day much easier and more enjoyable.

Went with two other couples. Perfect for gathering and relaxing. Kitchen stocked with lots of cookware.

I found making the reservations through Vacasa very easy.  I was pleased with the whole process.  I would definately use them again.  The price was fair for the house.

The house was within bicycling distance from SHARC & within walking distance of another nice park. There were bicycle paths galore & the deer would almost walk right up to you in the front yard!

We had a wonderful time here!   There were 8 in our group and there was PLENTY of room for us all!!    Both of the beds in the suites were so incredibly comfortable!   The house was in a PERFECT location... 1 block to the Fort Rock Park which is perfect for kids & a short 10 minute bike ride to the SHARC facility AND the North Pool.    The location is very central to everything.   I have nothing but great things to say about this place.    We loved every minute of our vacation here.   1 week was not enough time, I wish we could have stayed longer!!

Upstairs, you'll find an inviting great room and a large deck overlooking the woods, which gives you the feeling of a treehouse. In the living room everyone can sit around the fireplace or relax in front of TV, and at mealtime, you can cook up anything you like in the well appointed kitchen. You have your choice of where to eat - at the kitchen island or the spacious dining table, or on that wonderful deck with gas barbecue.

With four bedrooms, 6 Approach Lane sleeps 10, so it's perfect for a group of golfers or an extended family. Three bedrooms are on the top floor - One queen, a full and a master with a queen bed. The master bedroom has its own bath, and there's another bath in the hall. Downstairs, a fun bedroom is decked out with two bunk beds - plus, a TV room features a hideaway bed. A hall bath and washer/dryer area round out the rooms on this floor.

This is the kind of house with tons of amenities where family and friends can spread out and enjoy themselves. One group can socialize on the deck, someone can watch a ballgame on TV, and kids can have a blast downstairs. That's not even mentioning all the fabulous activities right outside your door. The only problem you'll have at 6 Approach Lane is deciding what to do first.

Great location. The posting needs updating as there is wifi and there are 3 functioning bikes (and 1 non functioning). The posting did not list these. I called Vacasa before hand and they confirmed that there were no bikes.  So, even Vacasa didn't know about the bikes.

Otherwise everything was great.

This house is in a great location and suited our needs.  It accommodates up to 10, we had 9 for 3 days and found it sufficient room for us.  Large dinning table plus the counter.  Great deck with large table and plenty of chairs.  Only complaint was the old refrigerator and dishwasher.

This house was very clean when we arrived.  I would stay at this property again because it's close to Sharc and the Village.  It had plenty of room for all 7 of us to do our own thing or play games and eat together.  It had 4 bikes in the garage which we used to get around everywhere.  Great rental property!!!

House is in a good location and we loved the privacy of the upper deck and the hot tub. Close to Marina and SHARC to do one of the many water activities. Many Sattelites and shooting stars were viewed from the deck in the late evening. Stayed pretty cool inside too despite the outside temperature.

Had a Racoon visit us when we were using the hot tub late at night, that was interesting, and a few deer lay down in the trees next to the place in the early mornings, so that was kind of a neat treat.

Cleanliness and attention to detail of the place left something to be desired though. Alot of mold on the shower curtain of the master bedroom forced us to use the hall shower, not acceptable. Light bulbs missing or burned out around the house seemed to be odd and for no reason even though we found replacements in the utility room downstairs. One kleenex box in the hall bath had two tissues left in it and no replacement? Upstairs carpet needs serious cleaning in the dining room area or replacement, it's pretty stained up from previous guests spilling things on it, too bad.

Few things that could use some updating...the TV and DVD player..fairly old, remotes only halfway worked. Not sure if it was a battery problem or not, but had to do most things manually. No blender in the kitchen and a few essentials weren't found...sugar among them.

Not a bad place, however we expected better for what we paid and might return if the above mentioned things were taken care of.

This house has a great location just needs interior upgrade.

Nice, spacious house. 3 full beds and 4 twin. None is queen or king. For the most part well maintained and clean. We were a little disappointed by the dirty carpet and couch. Unlimited SHARC passes, well maintained jacuzzi, and bicycles are nice features. The house does not have a real fireplace - just a gas one. Otherwise it is nice and enjoyable.

If you don't mind down and dirty, this house will work for you. It does sleep 10 people and is in a great location. 3 baths is good! Walk to SHARK. It is a worn out house that needs deep cleaning. There are 6 bikes but they are worn out too but do work. Nothing fancy, furniture is cheap and dirty. Kitchen is ok,

not a lot of storage because so many of the cupboards are locked. Hot tub wasn't hot when we visited but hopefully that got fixed.

Three-bedroom home on the Deschutes with a private dock!

Take your boat and dock it at this traditional riverfront Sunriver vacation rental. This one-story, spacious home has been recently renovated, from the carpet to the windows to bathrooms. It's the perfect spot for a guys' fishing getaway or a family or two that wants to be on the river.

You're right on the Deschutes River, just steps away from the water and quiet spots to contemplate life. Downtown Bend is only 22 miles away and the family-friendly slopes of Mt. Bachelor are only 25 miles from here.

This relaxing home boasts comfortable furnishings. The living room features new carpet as well as two traditional floral couches and a large flatscreen, cable-ready TV. There's also a stereo nearby to play your tunes so you'll be vacation ready in no time.

The kitchen is roomy and offers plentiful counter space to make your vacation meals. There's a large fridge, dishwasher, stove, and a two-seat stool set for quick breakfasts. An eight-seat dining room table awaits your formal dinners.

A family room sits off to the side with a lovely leather couch and cozy wood stove. But it's the gorgeous pool table that dominates the space. One wonders how many nights you'll be perfecting your game here. Sliding glass doors lead to a gorgeous deck with a firepit for marshmallow roasting and ghostly tale-telling.

The bedrooms and baths have been updated to reflect a comfortable but elegant decor. The master features a king bed in a large wood frame, sloped ceilings, a flatscreen TV, and a rocking chair. There's a large renovated bathroom nearby.

A second bedroom affords guests a queen bed in a wood frame under a striped coverlet and a third bedroom features a twin-over-full bunk bed, perfect for the younger members of your party. There's also another full bath down the hall. With the addition of the sofabed, this home can comfortably accommodate up to eight people!

Stay connected via the free WiFi and freshen your laundry at the provided washer and dryer. Games and books are available but you'll probably be spending most of your time on the water, either whiling away the hours or exploring the river. Guests are welcome to store their boats in the large circular driveway as well.

Oregon's high desert is the perfect place to relax and unwind. You can book fly fishing tours or ski lessons or perfect your kayaking technique. There are four golf courses nearby to improve your handicap or you can plan a special meal in any of the area towns nearby. It has something for everyone.

Beautiful property and very comfortable house.  Never could hook up to the Wifi but other then that we had a wonderful time.  Would recommend to a friend and would come back.

It was pretty difficult to open the lock with the key. We are also not able to open the door of garage, so we had to park the car outside. We were not able to figure out how to turn on the A/C. It was pretty hot w/o A/C.

Old renovated manufactured home. Large living area with small pool table. Outstanding view of the deschutes river, surrounded by amazing neighbors. 10 minute drive to sunriver and 20 to Wickiup Resv. Only thing this home lacks is A/C. I was a little surprised that an eastern OR home didn't have it. We stayed here on 2, 100+ days and the night time cool off was minimal. We would come again if A/C was added.

With a chef's kitchen, private hot tub, and wonderful location in the desirable Circle Four Cabin community, this elegant three-bedroom Sunriver vacation condo makes for a particularly luxurious Sunriver getaway! The space feels perfectly Oregonian with its mountain decor, but those beautiful hardwood furnishings and Western touches are anything but rustic. Recently remodeled, the condo offers all the modern comforts and conveniences of home.

The aquatic center is just one mile away from your cabin door, a very short bike ride along one of the many paved paths criss-crossing the resort. Also within easy reach are the Nature Center, Fort Rock Park's playing fields and tennis courts, the marina, horseback riding stables, and the Village at Sunriver. In this lively cluster of restaurants and shops, you can enjoy a freshly brewed beer or cup of coffee, book a guided expedition along the Deschutes River, and even enjoy a twirl around the seasonal ice skating rink in the winter months.

All the activity in the cabin will gravitate toward the spacious great room, which has vaulted ceilings and a beautiful river rock fireplace for chilly winter evenings. Curl up on the handsome sofa with a soft throw blanket and enjoy a cozy movie night or long conversation over a bottle of wine.

On the other end of the great room, the kitchen is both beautiful and functional. It was recently remodeled with brand-new stainless steel appliances, and the cabinets are well-stocked with all the pots and pans, dishes, dinnerware, cooking utensils, and glassware you need to prepare meals for a group.

You can dine at the six-person table near the fireplace, or head out the sliding glass doors to the private deck to enjoy the fresh mountain air as you eat. There is also a gas grill for summer barbecues, and of course the private hot tub that will soothe your sore muscles after a long hike or day of skiing.

The main floor has two bedrooms and a full bath with a tub/shower combo, making the condo appropriate for guests who would prefer to avoid climbing stairs. One of the downstairs bedrooms has a beautiful queen bed, and the second has two twin-sized beds; each has its own TV set. A laundry room sits between the two bedrooms, making it easy to keep up with hiking clothes and fishing gear.

The upper level is entirely devoted to the vaulted master suite. With its queen-sized bed, cozy window seat, flat-screen TV with DVD player, and private bath, the spacious suite makes a wonderful oasis within the home itself.

The cabin also includes complimentary wireless Internet access, a nice assortment of books and games, and five adult bicycles for your use!

The Circle Four community is one of the most popular in Sunriver, mostly because it offers the unique amenity of a private on-site pool. Of course, your stay in the cabin also includes the use of eight unlimited passes to SHARC, the brand-new aquatic center with indoor/outdoor swimming pools and year-round tubing hill.

Beyond the borders of Sunriver, year-round opportunities to enjoy the surrounding Deschutes National Forest await: skiing on Mt. Bachelor, fly fishing, hiking, mountain biking, snowboarding, kayaking, and much, much more.

Whether you are planning a romantic retreat for two, a ski weekend with friends, or just a good old-fashioned family vacation, this luxury Central Oregon vacation cabin in the heart of Sunriver won't disappoint!

Our stay was amazing, the property was great, very clean and nice. There was plenty of fire wood there for the nice fireplace, private hot tub was very nice after a long day hiking and walking around the village. Highly recommended and I would book again anytime!

SHARC was great for both our families to spend time.  Playground was also great for the family...lots of fun and different toys!  We just happened to be in town for "Kids Day in May" over the holiday weekend which was also great (a little on the expensive side for activities ie. $7 for each kid to go on a bouncy house).

Overall we enjoyed the stay, but there were a few hiccups with this particular property...

Before going into the issues with the house we stayed in let me begin by saying we stayed 5 nights with four adults and 4 small children under the age of 4 (specifically 3, 2 and twin 20 month girls).  This being said being able to limit little ones access to room on the main floor was nearly impossible as 2 doors (front mud room and master) didn't latch (striker plate didn't align with latch). Additionally the room with the 2 twin beds looked like it had been kicked in at some point (missing a large chunk of wood where the latch is.

The dryer would need to be run several times to dry the clothes (thinking it needs serviced and lint removed).  Vacuum cleaner was not functional upon arrival (owner was already aware of this) but the interesting thing is that it was FULL of pet hair (No pet allowed in this unit..and I have pet allergies)!  This was important factor for us having 4 small kids and carpeting under the dining room table.  The jets only seemed to work on half hot tub.  There is no fire escape ladder/device for the upstairs bedroom in the event there was a fire on the main level.

The shared pool key for the community pool (not the SHARC) was not there.  A Vacasa employee was able to find out why and apparently the last people to rent the house didn't return the key (so we were just out of luck).  We were not able to use the community pool (listed as an amenity of the vacation house).  Only one washcloth in the entire house...lacking some linens.

Very enjoyable stay. Beds are comfortable. Pleasant community. It should be noted, however, that cabin is much smaller then it appears in the photos. Still a great place to stay, but "cozy".

I've stayed in Sunriver many times over the years and this cabin was just okay. It had the basic amenities and on the upside was close to SHARC and the Village Shopping Center. However, this cabin was very small and is probably best for one family not two. This Cabin could also really use the carpets deep cleaned or totally replaced. Please keep in mind I'm probably fairly picky about this since I have a small child. We also tried to use the BBQ but it never got hot enough to cook the meat which was disappointing! I think this Cabin could be improved but adequate for someone looking for some place very basic to stay.

Overall the house functioned well and worked well for the # of people advertised and the beds were comfortable.  We did have a problem with the cleanliness of the house.  Basically it needs a good 'spring cleaning'  with surfaces wiped down, carpets cleaned and ceiling fans that have never been dusted.

The home itself was lovely. Nicely decorated, a beautiful kitchen, and a great setting. The staff at vacasa put us off, delayed our move,  let us wonder how long we would continue to freeze and let us sit in a freezing cold house in coats and boots way too long. And there response to my complaint was " thanks for your input hopefully we can do better" evidently not their problem they ruined a scarce chance to get away for the weekend!

We were happily surprised to walk in to such a beautiful and modern cabin. It was both cozy and very welcoming. Plenty of room for our group and it came with all the bathroom and kitchen amenities you would ask for. Only suggestions is for Vacasa to provide more firewood. We were told upon arrival that we only got one bundle as a starter.  This was not enough for our 5 day stay and the local store was out of firewood for sale almost everyday. The pics show a huge stack of firewood next to the cabin so it is a bit misleading.  Other than this, we had a great experience. Just plan ahead and bring the firewood you think you will need for your stay.

We really enjoyed staying at this cabin!  The fireplace and hot tub were both nice at the end of the day.  The kitchen was well equipped.  We were close to the swimming center which was nice also.  We will definitely stay here again in the future!

This cabin was great for our family get away.  Kitchen was well equipped.  Great for families that like to cook together, hangout and have some privacy sleeping.

This was a perfect get-away cabin.  We truly enjoyed this cozy cabin for our weekend of skiing!  We will most definitely  stay here again!

Had Christmas Eve dinner at Lodge. Food was excellent. Two people had steaks, one salmon and one specialty dish. The service was excellent and the Lodge was beautifully decorated inside and out with Christmas lights. We all enjoyed the

beautiful display of very unique Gingerbread Houses on the second floor of the Lodge.  We anticipated snow and there was none.  But I hired Doug from Sunriver Photography to take photos and he did an excellent job with a wonderful variety  of pictures at Caldera Springs. Pictures from the unique bridge, the dock with frozen lake behind it, and the blazing fireplace in the lodge will bring memories for years to come.  It was a great vacation for my son and friend from Newport Beach, CA and my other son from Portland. Although there was no snow the fireplace provided a warm, cozy, relaxing vacation for all.  Thank you for sharing your  home with us. Would love to go in the summer when we can walk the trails, bike and kayak.

Nice place, sleeps 8 but only seating in the living room for 4, had to bring in out side chairs.  Comfortable beds and bedding.

Came or a conference and had a great time

We brought our boys over for Spring Break and Easter...had great fun finding Easter eggs.  We went up skiing one day, went to the Shark center several days, went bike riding, enjoyed the hot tub and also just hung out and relaxed :)  Thanks for a great experience and happy memories....

We have stayed in #30 for at least the last 10 summers. We enjoy the remodel of the loft with the solid wall and window and door. It makes the loft much more soundproof and private than the other units. Also appreciate the new blinds for the inside loft window; blocks the early morning sun. Love the kitchen slate, new appliances, and pot hanger that were done a couple years ago. There are a number of bikes in the garage which are great for a true Sunriver experience.

Our trip was wonderful.  We also enjoyed the bikes

Our stay at 30 Circle 4 Lane was so wonderful. The cabin is in a very convenient location; a 6 minute bike ride to the SHARC, which is so much fun. Circle 4 has a pool that is shared with the other cabins in the circle; it was very nice to have a pool to swim in other than the SHARC. We were always alone in the pool; probably because we were there the week after Labor Day which is significantly less busy. The cabin itself was very nicely furnished with pots, pans, silverware, dishes, coffee maker, blender, etc. the kitchen is also very nicely stocked with spices, cooking oil, etc. Bikes are provided which is such a nice bonus as we didnt have to rent them. Dealing with Vacasa was incredibly easy; they were wonderful. My family will definitely be back to this cabin; we are already planning our vacation for next summer.

Four women enjoyed a pleasant two-day stay at this cabin.  We wish we could have stayed longer to fully take in the Sunriver experience, but our time was limited.  This cabin was very well designed in terms of utilization of available space.  The master bedroom, which occupies the upstairs area, was roomy and nicely decorated, and it has a bathroom adjoining it.  Downstairs are two other bedrooms -- one with a queen bed and one with two twin beds.  It was convenient to have a washer/dryer located in the hallway between the bedrooms, and the bathroom at the end of the hallway was clean.  We enjoyed the layout of the kitchen/living area.  The table was perfect for playing games, as well as for eating.  The hot tub was very nice, and is located in a private deck area between the house and the garage.  The day we checked out, we saw the hot tub maintenance person cleaning it and getting it ready for the next renters, which was nice.  The neighborhood where the house is located was quiet.  An enjoyable stay for the four of us!

The rental property was very nice and had every amenity that you could want, such as cookware, DVD players, wifi, hot tub, etc. However, there was a tv that wasn't working and the living room tv remote did not work. Other than those minor inconviences, it was very nice and we would stay again. Sunriver is a beautiful resort and there are many great adventures you and your family can go on. The hot tub was a very nice touch as well. We had fun, and most importantly, the kids loved it. We recommend this vacation to anyone who is thinking about going.

We stayed for a week while attending a wedding in Bend.  The property is excellent, well furnished, roomy, clean, etc...  We enjoyed the location as well and look forward to another visit.

I rented cabin #30 for my wife's 40th Birthday. My wife and I really enjoyed it. The rooms were beautiful, clean and spacious. We enjoyed the spa on the deck. The bike trails were truly enjoyable. We can't wait to rent it again.

We had a great stay in #30! There were 5 of us - and the 3 bedroom 2 bath was a perfect size for us. The hot tub was an extra treat too. The upper loft was a terrific space and I highly recommend renting this cabin for a family. Good great room environment while at the same time everyone has a room to retreat too for their own space. Enjoy!

We loved our stay in this cabin!!! It was so relaxing and comfortable. It was my first stay in a cabin so i was a little worried about the cleanliness but it definitely left a positive impression and was kept very clean! I would highly recommend this specific cabin to family and friends.  My only complaint is that the hot tub was set at 80 degrees, so it took a night to heat up to the right temperature before we could use it but overall it was no big deal considering everything else was great!!

Within a few minutes you have access to all that Sunriver has to offer, including golfing, restaurants, shopping, and more!

Wildflower #66 is is a beautifully shingled home tucked into this well manicured golf course community. Head inside and you'll find a spacious living room complete with a fireplace for chilly nights indoors, a flat screen television, and lots of board games for the ultimate in a family fun night. The sliding glass doors lead onto the deck where you can bask in the sun on summer days or use the gas grill for a picnic of burgers and hot dogs. Settle in to one of the comfortable sofas and enjoy the sunshine trickling through the windows or page through a foodie magazine looking up new recipes. With unique touches throughout the space, you will feel right at home.

Right off of the living room is a dining table with room for six. Enjoy a big dinner of steak and asparagus or play a late night game of cards. From there, you'll have easy access to the kitchen where you'll find a handy double oven, stovetop, full size refrigerator, and all the equipment to cook up a big Sunday dinner or bake some yummy chocolate chip cookies.

Head to the master bedroom when it's time to rest after a long day of kayaking on the Deschutes River. Here, you'll find a comfortable king sized bed, deck access through the sliding doors, and a fireplace for quiet nights in.

The kids will love having their own room where they can hang out and relax. This second bedroom has a queen sized bed and a twin, so the only thing they may fight over is who gets the big bed! This condo has 2.5 bathrooms, which means no one will have to wait long to use the shower. This home has a maximum occupancy of 6 and comfortably sleeps 5.

Staying at this home means you'll have access to all the fun to be had at SHARC: swimming pools, hot tubs, and the ever-popular lazy river! Not too far away, let yourself indulge in one of the Village's spas or peruse the boutiques; maybe when you're feeling adventurous, you can take a trip to the Deschutes River on a kayak or with a fishing pole; or you may choose something more leisurely like renting a bicycle to explore the nearly 40 miles of paved bike paths spread throughout this gorgeous resort destination. Of course, once the snow begins to fall, Mt. Bachelor's ski slopes are about thirty minutes away, while the ice-skating rink at the Village is just a quick walk!

Whether you stay here for the cozy atmosphere or because of its easy access to all the fun that Sunriver has to offer, you and your family will have an unforgettable stay.

We can't complain too much. We enjoyed our stayed very much so. We would love to come back very soon.

We LOVED staying at Wildflower 66...attractive, restful and comfy! Very impressed with the recent updates. Definitely would like to enjoy it again. G&D Alberts, Sammamish WA

Wildflower 66 is a nice place, although it is very near the main road and was fairly noisy with car traffic. It is located near the village and very close to SHARC, so if you are looking for lots of action and don't mind the hustle and bustle of Sunriver, it's a great place to stay. There were some minor cleaning issues that needed to be addressed (unmopped floors), but overall the place was really nice and very comfortable and had nice views of the golf course.

Our family of 4 thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Wildflower #66 and would definitely stay in this unit again.  It is the last of the Wildflower units so it is situated right next to Abbot Dr BUT the road noise is not an issue AND you don't have anybody walking or biking past your unit!  The unit offers a lovely view of the golf course out the back patios and we enjoyed seeing deer, coyotes and a woodpecker tending her nest of chicks.

Great space for the family. Walking distance to many amenities. Right on the golf course.  It is clear that the owners car for the property.

We decided last minute to stay in Sunriver.

This cabin was the perfect choice for a small family, with its 2 bedrooms.

If you appreciate elegant decor and top notch appliancess, this unit has it all.

What really appealed to us was the wood burning fireplaces.  During our stay, it was cooler in the area, and even thoug the unit is equipped with central heating , the fireplaces adds a special touch and warmth.

Conveniently located on the end of the fairway, it is very quiet wit easy access to the walkways, a short stroll to the village and the communit center.

for a quiet, romantic getaway, this unit  certainly exceeded our expectations.

This was a darling condo.  It was decorated great and very clean.

Great stay at Wildwood 66. The place was very clean , spacious and just right for our family. We enjoyed the puzzles, games and books provided.The cupboards had everything you needed to cook and bake with. I recommend that the frying pans be replaced as the teflon was chipped.  Very close to SHARC, Village and on Meadows Golf course. Sharc passes included with stay was an asset.

My family and I have stayed in this unit twice and have been very happy with our stay both times. This unit is newly updated and all of the beds are comfortable and it has a full size kitchen with everything you need . This unit has an open floor plan upstairs which allows for a lot of light and a spacious feel. It is a very close bike ride or walk to the Sharc and the village. Things that could be better: the furnace is outdated and there is no air conditioning. We had the door open with a fan blowing cool air only to have cigar smoke blow into the house on two separate occasions. Also, if you stay for a week , they do not accommodate you with a weeks worth of soap, towels, garbage bags ex. If you have 5-6 people staying here, you will be washing a lot of towels and there are no spare sheets for the queen or king bed. Overall , I highly recommend this unit because it is clean, updated, quiet and conveniently located to everything. We will be back!

Sunriver rental agencies tend to have 5-6 day minimum stays, which on this occasion exceeded what we could commit to. Vacasa's flexibility and offer of shorter minimum stays was greatly appreciated and enabled us to take a much-needed, albeit short vacation. The online reservation system was easy and allowed us to go directly to the property and bypass paper work at the rental office.

The property itself was fine. The picture and description on the website are a little misleading since it appears to be a single house, rather than a split-house. The updated features and uber comfortable beds were uncommon in our rental experience at Sunriver, and greatly appreciated.

We had a very fun trip to Sunriver. It was the first time I had been during the summer since I was a kid. The bike trails were as awesome as I remember. And the pool at the SHARC is fun for the whole family. This unit was the perfect spot for us. It is nicely updated and we loved the open dining/kitchen/living room upstairs with the big windows and patio overlooking the golf course! I would definitely stay here again. Other than short showerheads in the 2 full bathrooms, we had no complaints at all.

I would stay here again in a minute.  Close to the SHARC and village.  Very clean and everything you would need to cook a big meal.

This single level home offers three bedrooms and two full baths for six guests and one furry friend for an additional fee! The three bedrooms are sunny with decorative quilts, large windows, and calming accent colors. Guests will sleep easy in this home's king, queen, and full beds.

The fantastic back deck overlooks over a wooded acre along the Deschutes National Forest and a sprawling lawn for Fido to roam. Take a nap outdoors in the lounging patio furniture or look for deer, elk, and rabbits that commonly walk the grounds. Fire up the gas grill and serve a summer barbeque around the bistro table with seating for four, then watch for shooting stars at night!

Book a mountain bike tour to waterfalls with The Paulina Plunge, or discover local flora and fauna on the Trail to Benham Falls. Mt. Bachelor is a short drive away for winter skiing and the golf courses at nearby Sunriver Resort are a great afternoon activity when there's not snow on the ground.

The outdoors are just waiting to be explored at this lovely Central Oregon vacation rental! Whether curled up by the fire or navigating the unruly Deschutes River, this charming home is an ideal high desert getaway.

Everyone comes together to relax in the cute living room, with its comfortable furniture, stone fireplace and new TV. The airy teepee feeling extends to the walls, which divide the rooms but don't reach up to the ceiling - except in the bathroom, of course! You can cook in the convenient kitchen, and eat your meals in the dining area, or head to the deck for a barbecue and outdoor dining. Outside, you also have the chance to soak up the woodland setting as you soak in the hot tub.

For sleeping, you'll find two bedrooms - one with a king bed and the other with bunked twins and a queen.

This unique vacation rental is located close to bike paths, stables, a marina, and the fun stores and restaurants in Sunriver Village. Best yet, it's minutes away from SHARC, the fabulous new aquatic center. Your stay includes six free passes to enjoy the center's pools, play areas, all-season tubing hill and much more.

This is a cabin that offers a twofer: you not only feel instantly at home, but you also have the huge array of Sunriver activities right outside your door.

We really enjoyed our stay. As mentioned before, the walls are thin and the entire ceiling is open so privacy might be an issue for groups but for 1 couple it is a great value when you compare the inn at the 7th mt. Great kitchen and nice private hot tub. The train is loud.

close enough to everything and still having privacy.

These houses are extremely close to one another and have no privacy. There are train tracks 50 ft out your back door and the wall shaking freight train went by 4 times a day on the weekend. Bring lanterns or at least candles for hot tub as there is no lighting out back on the house or in or around the hot tub. There is no privacy other than the bathroom even with paper thin walls as the walls don't reach the ceiling so you hear even whispers from the next room. Arrive during day light or beware very hard to find at night. ok for a couple but you really get what you pay for which is cheap so just keep your expectations low.

We stayed  4 weekday nights, played in Mt. Bachelor snow, hung out in Sunriver.  Great experience, would do so again.  Only drawback were the train tracks in the backyard.  After first night this was very little of a problem.

We were able to walk most places from the house. It was very quiet except for the train, which was no big deal except it startled us out of sleep one night. The swim passes and washer/dryer were great!

We had a good stay here. My parents came to visit and had a nice time. Their only request would be to build some stair railings (to from carport to deck) - right now you have to balance your way down.  We would come again with this improvement.

Clean property, close to SHARC, also right next to railroad track.  No fancy furnishings, not many amenities but livable.

The only thing we missed was the laundry sopa so we could not start the towels when we left, otherwise we were pleased and delighted.

12 Juniper is a rustic accommodation. We decided it was a cross between a yurt & mobile home. Its got all the basic covered, but no dishwasher. It was fine for a weekend of running around & evenings in the hot tub.

My husband, 1 year old baby and I stayed at this home for a birthday celebration weekend. We had stayed at 13 Juniper the year before and thought this house looked fun. It is. The shape is unique. The reviews had warned about sound control being none due to the walls not extending to the ceiling. That was good to know. This was perfect for our family- we could be quiet when we put the baby to sleep. It would not have been good with 2 families. The hot tub was wonderful! Also it being pet free was an added bonus as I am allergic. Decore is from the 70's/80's but adds to the charm. For a couple or a family with one child this place is great.

This place is very charming and great romantic getaway with the hot tub and fireplace but there is definitely some maintenance issues that need addressed and be prepared to bring your own kindling if you are planning on using the fireplace.  The staff left an okay amount of firewood but no kindling or fire starter and no way to make kindling.

Maintenance issues to be addressed are:  replace bed, couch, pillow as very old and uncomfortable.  Fix or replace dining room and kitchen chairs as they are wobbly.  Get functioning light switches and/or lamps.  Fix hot tub light or install outdoor lighting so can see in the dark.  Fix fireplace face plate so can open and close grate and doors without moving the whole thing.

We would go back if they made the minor repairs as it was in a good location even with the train and a charming place overall.

We had a very relaxing and great experience! Hot tub w/ great view, bike rides, hanging out on the couch next to a wood stove playing board games. Comfortable king size bed. Home owner was also very friendly and helpful ! Would recommend  this house to any couple that wants to get away and enjoy sunriver.

Small, comfortable cabin located almost in the center of all activities - 2 minutes drive to almost everything you need (except mountain). Everything is good but beware!!! there are no actual walls (except restroom) but only high partitions. I was really happy with it but the people staying with me not really because of my night time snoring :-). I still feel myself guilty a little bit.

The house is a bit dated, but was very clean.   I would stay here again because the price was cheap.  We paid $75 a night.   There is a train that goes through the back yard.  It's probably about 15 yards from the house.  We actually loved watching it.  It would also go by once during the night.  It never bothered us though.  This is way better than some house that have the back yards facing a road.     The only really issue with the house is that the walls don't go all the way up to the ceiling, so the sounds carries.   This is only an issue if someone is trying to go to bed and others are staying up.

Excellent value. Trains very loud and property very close. I'd go back.

Great spot, especially if you like to sit and have peaceful environs, and if you like to watch the occasional train up close! We thoroughly enjoyed our time there.

This house had the basics, and for the price, was a good deal.  unfortunately, the location is very near the railroad tracks, which are very loud at night.   also, during the summer if it is real hot, the lack of AC is a challenge.  But this is only an issue a few days a year....   we have stayed a lot in sunriver, and while this house was not a favorite, it had all the basic needs.

Good location to SHARC & passes included. Clean home for the price. Teepee like roof with no ceiling makes noise carry and there is very little privacy. Train behind property is noisy.

We loved this place!   The house was great and close by everything!

I have stayed in Sunriver many times and just needed a place for 2. If you need an inexpensive place to stay this will work. They should warn you that it is within feet of the railroad. Dangerous with small children.

We loved Sunriver. So much to do. We were only there for a couple days but will go back next year and spend at least a week. The home on Juniper was very comfortable and served our needs. Cute Tee Pee style. A few things to note, the walls do not go all the way up except in the bathroom. So if you want total privacy from kids or friends it might not work for you. Also there is a train running through the back yard. Even though it did wake us up at night briefly it was surprisingly quiet. No blaring horns. It was not a real problem at all. My husband and son loved to run out when it came by. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and for the price will definitely go back again.

We loved this awesome cabin at Sunriver and highly recommend this to anyone interested in visiting Sunriver. Absolutely a fabulous get away!

what a great place; plenty of room to roam around!  3 bathrooms!!! big nice bedrooms!  beautiful landscaping.  we hope to rent it again sometime.

Home has a great layout with a full bathroom with each of the three bedrooms. Nice laundry room. Televisions in each bedroom. Great outside space with deck, tables/chairs, bench seating. Quiet loop. Nice to see the deer browsing and quietly moving through the area early mornings and late evenings.

Location, size & cleanliness were all acceptable & as described. Unfortunately the mattresses were very old and flat. The pots and pans are all small & flaking peices comng off so most were to undesirable to use for obvious health reasons. There's bikes but they are locked and there's nowhere to store food you buy because the cupboards are full & large pantry is locked. I would stay here again if the above all changed otherwise on to a different home. It has great potential if the owners spent a little money on the basics comforts of a home for vacationers.

We loved the spacious and comfortable accommodations.  Each bedroom had its own full bathroom and there was extra sleeping space in the loft that 1 of our granddaughters cheerfully occupied.  Wonderful!  The living area has the most cushy and comfortable sofas and chairs.  Large dining table.  Kitchen fully equipped with dishwasher and large refrigerator/freezer as well as numerous eating and cooking dishes, utensils, and supplies.  We would definitely stay here again.

We stayed for the weekend really enjoyed our stay. The house was definitely sporting a late 70's to early 80's vibe, but not in a cheesy way. The number of rooms and the fact that each bedroom had its' own bathroom was a definite plus. The house was very clean and everything was explained well and easy to use (except perhaps the pots and pans - need some upgrading there for sure). All in all it was a great place and fun trip back in time.

The kitchen was adequately stocked with pans and utensils but has absolutely no storage area for things brought by the guest.   All our food had to be stored on the surface if the counters.  Also the home has no hot tub.

We liked floor plan and that each bedroom has its own bathroom. We liked that we could use the garage...we stored our canoe and bikes in there. The location is good and there was plenty of parking.  The house was clean. It worked very well for 3 couples.  We would definitely stay there again.  Homey and comfy.

Great location near Fort Rock park. The layout of house was perfect especially for three families and kids.

My family recently attended a baseball tournament in Bend and needed a place for 4 adults and 3 kids. This house was perfect, 3 masters down and a loft with two twin beds. Kids shared one bathroom and adults had their own bedrooms and bathrooms. The place is cozy, not fancy, big table in dining area for games (dominoes) and meals. Living space is open for watching TV, reading, etc. Would rent there again, but would bring more things for cooking and a couple bikes.

22 Camas was very comfortable and we enjoyed our time there very much.  The cookware is in rough shape and I'd recommend it be replaced.  Otherwise, terrific!  Wood-stove was nice on cold evenings:)

Hello, every summer I come to Sunriver for the Pacific Crest race weekend. I usually bring family and friends. The house we stay in -22 Camas is perfect for a larger group!! The deck outside is nice to relax on and the dining room table is large enough to seat everyone!! The house is a great deal for the price. I will be back.

When we stayed here, the pots and pans were in terrible shape. There were not many cleaning supplies available either, so it was difficult to clean up the kitchen after the meals we could have there. If you're looking to cook, I'd choose a different place.

We had a great time in Sunriver. The house was great, and Sunriver was a great place for the whole family. I especially enjoyed taking our daughter to the rec center for a swim!

I rented this house for a girls weekend. Prior to my arrival the staff answered all of my questions every time I called. I changed my mind on a few things and every time I called VACASA they were friendly and very helpful.

This house is a great value for groups of 7-10. We really loved the fact that it had 3 bathrooms. It was a great floor plan. The living/dining/kitchen is very open and super bright with all the shades open. Even though our trip was rained out for a whole day we managed to enjoy the patio area which is really nice with lots of seating.

We cooked every meal in the kitchen and no one complained that there werenâ€™t enough tools to get the job done. I really liked the large table so that everyone could eat together.

It was nice to have shampoo/conditioner in the showers. There was laundry soap and the kitchen had enough bags and paper towels. The whole house was nicely stocked with  cloth towels. Bring beach towels if you plan to visit the SHARC facility, they donâ€™t provide towels there.

The house is a little older and maybe it could use a few upgrades but honestly we had such a great time that no one complained about any of that. I would suggest to the owners to consider putting on low flow shower heads. While it was nice to take a hot shower with tons of water, I was afraid that the water heater would run out. It never did even with 7 ladies showering each day-whew!!

I would definitely stay here again with the same amount of people. A huge thanks to the owners for making their home available to us!!

Sincerely,

Lisa Engel

needs better beds, another tv, and it would be nice if everything was functional upon arrival.

The house is in a quieter area with families. It was perfect for us (group of 5). It only has one television (which should be a plus - but for us it was not). The deck wrapped around the side and back of the house. Deer all over the place. In a word, serenity. Thank you for letting us stay at this lovely home.

The home needs an update with at least one of the matteresses. The King size bed was comfortable but one Queen bed needs some TLC.

The TV in the big living room is made for a bedroom and needs a big screen. No bikes the one that was there was locked and was only for the family that own it. Would be nice to be able to use the closet in the kitchen for more space to put our things but it again was locked. The dishwasher is built right next to the refergerator what ever construction company did that should be ashamed you can't open both at the same time. I did like that the home was very clean. Had lots of beds, blankets, and the kitchen was stocked well with everything needed to cook.We did end up walking to the mall a nice mile + walk but it was closer than we thought. I would recommed this property to a group, but for the price it's too expensive for just one family a night. Split with a group it's not so bad.

In other homes we've stayed in in Sun River, there are usually some condiments (sugar, salt, etc.) and other items to use in the kitchen, in case you forget them.  If you stay here, remember to bring EVERYTHING you need, including sharp knives.  There are some pans and other items, but not a lot of options.  They padlock the kitchen pantry, so you won't have access.

Very nice house, nice location. I think some of the furniture and appliances could updated. Just looks a little old inside. We had a great time and there was plenty of room for 6kids, and enough hot water for all 3 showers to be running. I would stay there again

Our ladies prayer group gathered at this home and it was so lovely!  The kitchen was very well stocked with all the needed accouterments and the furniture and beds were very comfortable and clean.  We would like to return at some point in the future!

Had a really good time, wish we could have stayed longer!

A few issues:

1) the code to enter was incorrect, but when I called the property manager she was very helpful- problem fixed

2) The TV did not have a remote..

3) the internet connection was not working.  I was able to connect to the modem...but it there was a problem connecting to the ISP

Restored historic cottage near the Deschutes River with AC!

This historic and pet-friendly, four-bedroom Sunriver vacation rental offers a super fun, Central Oregon experience.

Private hot tub, walk to the Village at Sunriver, SHARC!

This cute and nicely updated two-bedroom Sunriver vacation rental has everything you'll need for a memorable family vacation! It's even pet-friendly (one dog allowed) and boasts a private hot tub, along with access to all the great Sunriver Resort amenities!

This prime spot is less than a half-mile from Sunriver Brewing Company and the other attractions at the Village at Sunriver. And with miles and miles of paved multi-use trails around the resort, exploring on two feet (or two wheels) is easy, whether it's a 10-minute walk for a pint of Vicious Mosquito IPA at the brewery or a two-hour hike. You'll even have passes to SHARC (also close enough to walk!) so you can spend your days playing in the pools.

Besides a great location, this single-level Sunriver retreat at 12 Deer Lane offers a cozy, river-rock gas fireplace in the living room, along with gorgeous wood paneling, tall slanted ceilings, and plush seating. There's a flatscreen TV in the living room, as well as a DVD player (with a movie library), and cable. The decor is rustic-chic, with a bright and updated cabin in the woods theme.

You'll have a gas grill and outdoor furniture on the deck and a fully stocked kitchen inside, complete with shiny stainless steel appliances (including a dishwasher for easy clean-up). Bonus gadgets include a blender, coffee grinder, and toaster so hearty breakfasts will be on the agenda here!

Meals can be taken at the large dining room table right under the charming antler chandelier - and if some of your guests are still in the living room, the open floor plan makes socializing easy.

And don't forget the private hot tub! It's the perfect place to soak and relax sore muscles or simply lay back and count the stars overhead.

At night, the two bedrooms each have a queen-size bed, as well as a TV, and provide comfortable sleeping space for up to four guests. Both rooms continue the woodsy theme with colorful quilts, log-style beds, and hunting/fishing knickknacks on the walls. And if you do bring a dog, it's just a small nightly fee.

Other amenities include board games, a washer and dryer, two-and-a-half bathrooms, WiFi throughout, and a stereo with a CD player.

At this popular Central Oregon resort in the high desert, you'll have four golf courses to choose from, over 30 miles of paved trails to explore, a seasonal ice skating rink, and even horse stables. At SHARC you can splash around in the pools, enjoy a lazy river, relax in hot tubs, and more.

In winter, the slopes at Mt. Bachelor are just under 20 miles away. And year-round, Bend is just a short 18 mile drive from your door for more brewery hopping, shopping, and dining.

Visit this comfortable and well-located Central Oregon vacation rental  for fun in the sun, deluxe resort amenities, and family adventure!

Great place to stay! Location was great, very clean and comfortable . Would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others!

Enjoyed our two nights at Deer 12, the swing out back was so peaceful and relaxing and the hot tub under the stars was magical. The home is furnished with lots of rustic cabin dÃ©cor and the furniture was all very comfortable. The kitchen was fully furnished and there were lots of extras like board games, candles, and high end toiletries. The price, location and comfort are hard to beat.

This house was the perfect condo/hotel alternative for just the two of us.  It was nice to enjoy the deck, hot tub, and peacefulness of the property.  We stayed  here during the heatwave of 4th of July, and luckily there were plenty of fans to cool off the house in the evening.  The house is close to the train tracks but didn't bother us.  I would choose this cute house again for another trip to Sunriver.

perfect rest and get away!

We spent Mother's Day weekend here with our two small children, ages 8 and 4.  The house was PERFECT for us.  You can't beat the location.  The decor was super-cute, beds were comfortable, the kids loved the board game selection and the deck and hot tub were relaxing.  We will be back!

The lodge style feel of this property with plenty of space and many amenities made for a great 4 day stay.

We decided at the very last min to take our 13 year old twins and two other teens on a two day getaway and it had to be on a budget. This rentall was beyond reasonably priced and the vacasa staff were instantly in touch with me when I inquired. Once we arrived we (our family) had to work around our misunderstanding about the location, (we thought it was closer to the mall) and how to access the onsite facilities, but free Shark passes were a treat and greatly added to the value of our stay. We had a blast and made a memory we will treasure.

We were very happy with property location and its condishion. We had enjoied our time in sunriver. Thanks to VACASA staff.

This classic Sunriver vacation rental makes a wonderfully cozy retreat at any time of year! Spend winter evenings snuggled around the stone hearth, or enjoy a summer barbecue on the back deck, surrounded by pine trees and fresh mountain air. With a fantastic location just a 10 minute walk from SHARC, the brand-new aquatic and recreation center, there is plenty to love about this special three-bedroom retreat (including the reasonable price!).

With tall windows, vaulted ceilings, and warm hardwood walls and timber beams, the open great room is simultaneously cozy and spacious. Sink into one of the plush sofas or armchairs and spread a board game out on the coffee table for a relaxing evening around the fireplace.

Behind the living area, the full kitchen is equipped with all the pots and pans, dinnerware, and cooking utensils you need, along with plenty of countertop appliances to make preparing meals easy. Grab a stool along the breakfast bar for a quick bite, or seat everyone around the dining table for a more formal meal.

A set of double doors opens onto the wraparound deck, where a gas grill and patio dining set await your summer barbecues! The house is surrounded by pine trees and located along a quiet cul-de-sac, so you can enjoy some true peace and quiet as you sit out on the deck and enjoy the sunshine.

The home has three bedrooms and two and a half baths, making it comfortable for up to eight guests to share. The master suite has its own private wing with a queen bed, full bath, and double French doors that open onto the deck. A second bedroom has a queen bed, and the third has two twin-sized beds. The twin bedroom has a cable TV with DVD player, allowing younger guests to settle in with a movie while the adults enjoy peaceful conversation around the fireplace or on the deck.

Your stay in Sunriver includes six passes to SHARC, the resort's brand-new aquatic center with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, year-round tubing hill, and hot tubs, located just a few minutes' walk from your front door. To explore further afield, take advantage of the five bicycles provided (four adult, one child) and the nearly 40 miles of paved trails criss-crossing through the resort.

Ten minutes away, the Village at Sunriver has plenty of dining and shopping to keep you entertained, and golfers can choose from four excellent courses to book their morning tee times. Afternoons may be spent lounging by the pool, horseback riding, or kayaking along the Deschutes River. And don't forget to bring along the family dog, for a small nightly fee, you can spend the weekend romping along the river or curled up by the fire with your four-legged friends.

In the winter, of course, skiing and snowboarding are only twenty minutes away at Mt. Bachelor; furthermore, the Village offers a seasonal ice-skating rink for a romantic twirl after dinner. No matter the time of year, Sunriver is a wonderful destination for a relaxing getaway, and the lovely Central Oregon vacation home at 1 Raccoon Lane will make your stay especially memorable.

Great location among the pines and close to the Village.  Bike path is around the corner.  Lovely home.  However, beware that the flat screen T.V. is located in one of the bedrooms, so if you are traveling with small kids, that might be difficult for the adults who want to stay up later and watch a show.

Perfect location to access all the main areas of Sunriver.  Very quiet & cozy.  Had a small chihuahua & he did great!  We didn't use bikes, but saw some available if needed.  All appliances & kitchen items were of great use & quality.  Bedrooms roomy & more than enough blankets & pillows.  Only bummer, was there was no air conditioning in the 95+ degree heat.  Otherwise, all great!

Very happy with the rental.  Instructions were easy and house was well equipped.  Quiet neighborhood steps away from the SHARC and minutes away from the Village.

Be aware that the hot tub at SHARC is for over 18 only.  This was a big disappointment for our kids. There was not much reason for the parents to go in the hot tub outside of the building, while the kids were inside swimming. I understand this is beyond the control of the owners of the home, but it is a disappointment and I wish the SHARC center would have a more flexible policy.

Clean and very quiet. Great for relaxing or reading. Needs a tv in the living room.

The house was situated in a nice area. Easy to find. Close to everything. Enjoyed the bike/hike trails. Quiet and didn't mind the very occassional train as they didn't blow the whistle.

We had a wonderful visit to Sunriver. The location of 1 Raccoon Lane was great. We could easily access the bikes paths, and the SHARC was walking distance. It was perfect for our family of 4 plus my parents.

Remember this is a pet friendly place, if you have dander allergies like me proceed with caution, this place will enhance those allergies. Our hypoallergenic dog had a great time but my allergies flared up in a big way. This place is in a great location, very near to all of the cool activities in Sunriver - SHARC, village, trails, etc.

This was an excellent location very close to SHARC and the village.   We had 7 people so we loved the fact that it has 3 toilets & lots of extra toiletries. Only 1 tv in 1 bedroom, a plus for us.  Open the windows in the evening to cool the place down.  We had a good experience here.

This is a great home in Sunriver.  It's worth noting that there isn't a TV in the living room, but if you'd rather read a book by the fire, it's perfect.

very nice place to stay.  it was a nice family girl's time away with me, my mother and my aunt.  I had two dogs who had to get away from the july 4th fireworks and we only heard two fireworks go off during our entire stay there. It got very hot during the summer, but with the excellent windows (with the screen doors) and the overhead fan, we were able to keep cool throughout.

Vacasa did a great job of preparing this property for guests.  Locating the property was a little more challenging than indicated in the directions, but manageable.  Everything one might need was there.  We felt very much at home while there.  Sunriver is an excellent locale for any level of activity, year round.  Our thanks to the property owners for making this location available to the public.

It would be nice to have a television in the living room

This traditional and warm Sunriver vacation rental is the perfect place to stay while you explore fun-filled Central Oregon! With a gorgeous and welcoming interior, a private hot tub, and access to the amenities in Sunriver, this home will help you feel rested, relaxed, and ready to have adventures!

Sunriver Resort, nestled along the mighty Deschutes River at the base of the Cascade Mountains, is about 15 miles south of Bend. This particular home is located conveniently close (a short five-minute walk) to one of the main attractions in the community, SHARC, where you will find an enormous aquatic center that will keep you entertained no matter which season you visit.

Step inside this traditional-style home and you will immediately feel a sense of warmth from the gorgeous wood walls, cozy fireplace, and windows and skylights that let in plenty of sunlight. Have a seat on the soft couches and read a book in front of the lovely gas fireplace, or simply sit with a mug of cocoa or glass of wine and tell stories while the fire flickers gently.

Behind the living room you will find a full kitchen that is completely stocked with the tools and equipment you may need during your stay. Simply bring your own groceries, then enjoy preparing meals in this spacious, clean, and well-appointed kitchen. You will have no trouble whipping up anything, whether you envision a simple breakfast of eggs and bacon or a more elaborate Sunday brunch of mushroom quiche and French toast. Sit down at the eight-seat dining room table and enjoy a leisurely meal together to fuel up for a day of vacationing.

Upstairs in the loft area, a large sofa piled with pillows is the ideal place to lounge and watch some cable TV or use the DVD player to have a movie night. With WiFi access throughout the house you will have no trouble staying connected, and you could watch YouTube or stream music for an impromptu dance party!

This home has three bedrooms and a loft, and up to 10 guests will be perfectly comfortable spread out among the various sleeping places! You will also find three full bathrooms throughout the house, as well as a laundry room, so there's no need to worry about getting your clothes dirty while you're exploring the great outdoors.

The master bedroom, located on the ground floor, has a fabulous queen-size bed and a recently remodeled attached bathroom that will make you feel like you're in a spa. The two remaining bedrooms both have lovely queen-size beds outfitted with warm and soft linens. Upstairs, part of the loft area serves as an additional bedroom, and would be a perfect place for kids to sleep because it has two sets of twin bunks, a large flatscreen TV, and even a foosball table!

The inside of this home is fantastically warm and welcoming, but don't overlook the outside! A tree-lined yard area is the perfect place to let any children run around. This home allows you to bring along one dog (with a $10 nightly pet fee and a $40 minimum per stay), so your furry friend will love to sniff around the pine cones.

A patio area is an ideal place to sit and breathe in the fresh air, or you could take advantage of the nice weather to use the gas grill to cook up a casual barbecue for everyone. You will be delighted to find a private hot tub, just for you and your guests! Relax in the luxuriously warm, bubbling water and let all your troubles melt away.

Within the community of Sunriver, you will have access to a plethora of fun activities. Head down to the SHARC to use the shared pools, hot tubs, picnic area, playground, and sports courts. If you love to golf, be sure to check out the four golf courses throughout the resort, or you could play tennis at one of the 26 tennis courts, visit a park, or walk or bike around the 40 miles of pathways that crisscross the resort!

You could also book a horseback riding tour, get a massage at the spa, or visit the fitness center. For even more options, venture out of Sunriver; the Deschutes River is a fantastic place to go rafting, skiing at Mt. Bachelor is just a 30-minute drive away, and lakes such as Wikiup Reservoir are within a scenic hour drive.

Just a mile away from your rental home is The Village, a cluster of restaurants and shops, where you can grab a bite to eat or stock up on basics at the market. Be sure to visit the larger city of Bend, just 25 minutes up the highway and explore its many famous breweries, grab a bite to eat (try the Portuguese chicken stew at Mediterranean restaurant Cafe Sintra), and walk around the beautiful parks that line the Deschutes River.

However you choose to spend your visit, come stay at this inviting, warm, and cozy Central Oregon vacation rental and be rested and ready to have a fun-filled trip!

Great property, great location.  Very clean and quiet.  Would love to stay again in the future.

The place worked out really well for the 8 of us.  There is actually more room than listed in the description, as there is a bunk room with 4 beds, and three additional bedrooms with a queen sized bed.  So it was better than advertised.  The kids loved the foosball table and the location of the house was great for us.

The house actually had 4 bedroom instead of 3.

We definitely will rent this house again.

Great location

The property location and layout are great, but the place needs serious attention. The master bathroom has been recently redone and was quite nice.

1. The dishwasher has broken racks on the bottom so you can only use 3/4 of the space effectively. The soap dispenser didn't open most of the time (which we discovered after we all noticed the wine tasted funny!) so there was residue all over the dishes - we finally just left the trapdoor open and placed the soap packets inside. It is ancient and needs replacing. The  cooking range is quite old and electric but reasonably functional, though if you like to cook this place will frustrate you. The refrigerator is relatively new and very clean but has no ice maker.  The knives need sharpening.

2.  The dryer appears new, but took 2-3 cycles to dry reasonable loads of clothes. I tried clearing the vent line as it exits the home and this helped some but didn't fix the problem.

3. Not a single one of the blinds in the upstairs kids loft bunk bedroom was functional (no strings or strings did not work, blinds bent and in poor repair in general).  With only a single lightbulb fixture on the wall, it made the room quite dark to never be able to open the shades.  The foosball table is awesome, though!

4. The upstairs shower head fixture is pulling out of the wall.  The upstairs bathroom has a double sink but one faucet sprays all over the place and we just avoided it to keep the counter and floor dry.

5. One of the dining chairs inside and one patio chairs each have a broken leg, beware, one of us nearly hit the floor inside!

6. For a rental property, providing pool towels would be great! There are several in the bathrooms that are threadbare anyway and could easily be converted to pool status!

Overall the place fit our needs despite the minor cleanliness and basic maintenance issues. I think the best aspect would be location, and the master bedroom/bath.   At its current condition I think the price may have been a little high.  It was very nice to find the bikes in the garage!

Loved our stay!! Will definitely stay here again. Perfect for 8 people. Kitchen was well stocked for any cooking project! Large table, loved the living room, fireplace, and especially the hot tub!

Our only inconvenience was no TV downstairs,but this could be a plus for some renters and was not a big deal.  Master bath is amazing !!

This was a great property that slept everyone very comfortably. The kids loved the foosball table and bunk beds. The loft with TV was nice since it allowed the living area to be used for conversation without competing with the TV. Beds were comfortable and the layout was very accommodating.  Everything  about are stay with Vacasa could not have gone better.If you are looking to stay around central Oregon you must look at staying with Vacasa..

We stayed 4 nights at 8 Lofty Ln. and, as always, enjoyed our time in Sunriver.  Rode bikes, went to the SHARC, went to Mt. Bachelor, etc. We have rented several different houses over the years in Sunriver, so I have basis for comparison.  This house has a great location.  Walking/bike ride distance to the SHARC.  Quick drive to the village.  On a nice little loop too which is good for kids riding bikes, playing, etc.  The house is nice and in good shape.  Beds are comfy.  Sleeps 10 (3 queens and 4 bunks). The double shower in the master is very nice.  Plenty of closet space.  We used the BBQ several times and they provided plenty of propane (although we had to use a lighter to start it because the ignitor wasn't doing the trick).  Two HD TV's, Wifi, comfy couches, and a foosball table were all nice too.  We did have some issues however.  The hot tub did not get hot, only warm.  We turned the temp up all the way, but it wouldn't get hot enough to use.  We could not get the fireplace to work.  This was not that big of a deal, since we're not really fireplace people, but if it's complicated to operate, perhaps there should be instructions near by (unless there were and I missed them). The kitchen is lacking in  a few essentials also.  We arrived late our first night and just got a take-n-bake pizza to cook in the over when we got there.  Oven worked great, but there are no oven mits that I could find.  Had to use a towel to get the pizza out.  No pizza cutter either (although that is not really an "essential").  There was no tinfoil, ziplocks, or Tupperware to put left overs in.  That seems like something that should be in every kitchen.  Also, there was no drawer or basket with pens, pencils, note paper, scissors, etc. that I could find anywhere.  Seems like something that should available for guests.  It might be nice if there were some spare 9V batteries in the house too.  One of the smoke detectors started chirping in the middle of the night.  I had to take it apart and set it aside until I could go to the store the next day to get more batteries.  Overall, we did like the house and, with a few minor additions/fixes, things would have been perfect.

This is a great house for a large or small family and was perfect for the 7 of us.  The only complaint is the lack of insulation between the first and second floors which makes the downstairs very loud.  Close to most attractions like SHARC and the Village.  Comfortable beds and cozy furniture to curl up in.

Beautiful home with private hot tub, space for eight guests

You'll hear lots of "wows" when you and your guests step into this Sunriver lodge-style home and view the beautiful Western interior. From the impressive living room with its large stone fireplace to the state-of-the-art kitchen and gorgeous dining set, this home offers every amenity you can imagine.

The Western theme and wood accents set the stage for fun and relaxation in this handsome setting. You can play Ping-Pong, soak in the hot tub, or sit back and watch a movie - there's a TV in every room!

The home sleeps eight people in its four bedrooms, and everything is on a single story so you don't have to bother with stairs. The master suite features a king bed with elegant bed coverings and lovely rustic furnishings, and a second king bedroom is equally well appointed in rattan. The third bedroom has a queen bed with a colorful quilt, and the fourth has a twin over twin bunk bed. The house features 2.5 baths - all tastefully decorated, too.

In the spacious kitchen, you have the facilities to prepare any kind of cuisine that strikes your fancy. Eat at the large, elegant wood dining table, or head to the deck for a meal overlooking the woodlands.  The attractive patio furnishings and the hot tub will keep you out on the deck even longer.

The house is located at the north end of Sunriver, a more private area that offers easy access to Hwy. 97. Zip down the highway to Bend for world-famous breweries, a fine variety of restaurants, and shopping galore - or stay in Sunriver to enjoy everything from hiking and kayaking to golf and tennis. Another perk when you rent this fine home: 8 free passes to SHARC, the fantastic new aquatic center.

9 Wallowa has it all, from exceptional decor to a wonderful setting close to skiing in winter and the wide array of summer activities. This is the kind of vacation home you dream about, whether you want to bring a large family or a group of golf buddies. Book 9 Wallowa now to turn your dream into a reality!

This house was in a great location.  The house had everything we needed and then some!  Even though some people cheated in ping pong, we had a great time enjoying the house and its surroundings.

We will definitely be back!

Located about a 15 min bike ride from the village. House has comfortable furnishings and loved the western decor.  Bikes were enjoyed by all! Loved having 2 master suites.

Sun River is a great place to stay! Lots to do. Biking, hiking, skiing nearby, sight seeing, brewery's to check out, good food everywhere! Can't go wrong here anytime of year.

The house was excellent. We especially enjoyed the fact that there were Christmas decorations up, including a tree.  It made our Christmas vacation with our family very special.

The only thing I would suggest is that a note be put in the other wise excellent instructions, that if you use the hot tub, make sure at least one door is unlocked.  We got stranded in the hot tub one cold evening. We had no key, and no phones with us to call anyone, and it was cold outside. Fortunately, the neighbor was home and had the on call number.  The on call people informed us of the location of the extra lock box.  Phew.

Otherwise, the entire stay was brilliantly wonderful.

Nice little house that's cozy and has all the amenities.  The ping pong in the garage was the surprise hit.  You could say that it was a little far away, but SR is so big now that if you want newer, like we did, that's just the way it is.  It makes for a great morning coffee walk and with no set time frames, the bikes got us where we wanted to go with no problems.

The lay out of this house was perfect for us! With two master suites, an open living area and a hot tub made for great quality relaxing time around the house. It was fairly close to the village where our event was and good restaurants. We will be back next year!

This place was very clean, great layout and close to everything we were interested in.  Every time you looked around inside there was something new to see.  Very interesting western themed decor.  We hope to come back in the winter.

We have stayed at many homes in Sunriver over the years, and I will say that this home was very cozy and well maintained.  We are a family of 6 and the home fit well with all of our needs.

This is a very nice place if you like a western theme. It was very clean and we enjoyed our stay! Can't wait to go back again!! We loved the  big fireplace!

Beautiful, comfortable home for all, had everything we needed. Enjoyed the hot tub, ping pong with grandkids, biking. Sharc was a blast. There is a small store near by (walking distance). Road noise when out on the deck BUT this would not stop us from renting this house again. We all had a great time, should have stayed longer!

Great little home with lots of character.  Kids enjoyed the antlers, animal mounts, and cowboy theme.  Would rent here again!

We had such a wonderful time.  The house was clean.  The area was peaceful.  Loved seeing the wildlife walk right through the yard.  Bike trails were fun and not too difficult.  The beds were very soft and very comfy pillows!  We really enjoyed this house and I'm currently looking at renting this house again as well as a couple of people we came with.

Very pleased with the location and cleanliness of this house.  The home was well stocked (including a coffee grinder).  Can't wait to stay here again.

I especially liked the layout of the house. Having 2 en suite bedrooms was nice.  The house was well stocked with items that are too big to bring or that you wouldn't necessarily think to bring. Even had shampoo and conditioner.  Would have been nice to have basic supply of spices, etc. Fortunately, I brought my own. The house is nicely furnished with exception of mounted animal heads and fur-backed chairs and pillow. This is just personal preference. Nice to have a hot tub. Some used it several times. I didn't like the location as it was somewhat close to Cottonwood which is the main North entrance and it is also close to the railroad tracks. Unfortunately, it was very busy at Sunriver (July). I might come again, but at a different time of year.

This was our first visit to Sunriver, and we loved it. So much to do and see, we will return. The house was perfect. The size, layout, and location were perfect for our two families. Thanks!

This is a property that feels like home away from home and can accommodate a group with the need for time together and time to be alone.  The kitchen is very well stocked and easy to cook with friends.

Great property for what we needed.  Plenty of room for the family to visit and spend time in various parts of the house.

Vacasa is one of my favorite companies to deal with when renting homes. The reservation process has always been helpful and willing to work with my needs. When I have run into problems in the past, which have been minor they have always been quick to respond. Thank you

Overall we really enjoyed the house, its location & amenities.  The layout up stairs is a bit awakward. The bonus room turned into Master is pretty but there is nowhere to put clothes, no closed or dresser.  The A/C was awesome!! Overall really nice.

Lots of sleeping space, large kitchen and deck that accommodates a larger group.

Nice house in a quiet street. Very spacious. The back bathroom had a noisy drip in it and the house could use some TLC. But generally it was a nice place to stay.

They house had good hang out area for adults and kids.

The home is nicely decorated with a rustic feel. Large grill and outdoor deck. Upstairs master bedroom is newly remodeled with huge walk-in shower and lounge area w/large flat panel TV. Kitchen has everything that you would need for your stay. Might want to bring your own bikes though as there are only 2 operable adult bikes and 2 very small bikes.

The rental was nice and clean and having the sharc passes and several bikes available was an added plus.  The hot tub was a nightly ritual.  Everything was so nice and clean my family is already planning next summer's vacation back in Sunriver!

The property was beautiful and had everything we needed for the weekend. Thank you so much.

The master bedroom or more precise the Master Suite was the best including the 9 shower head shower! This home is very private. No bike paths within view. That is a PLUS! Short 5 minute bike ride to SHARC, Village, Marina, and the North Pool. Very GOOD location! Vacasa customer service was the BEST!

The house was amazing! A lot of amenities very spacious!

Nice house, roomy enough and a good sized dining table for all to gather around for food or games! The deck was relaxing and very peaceful. The bicycles were in good operating condition - so that was also nice. We didn't use the spa - but it looked fine.

No one checked to insure home utilities I.e. air conditioner, are in good working order.  the privacy shutter blinds need replacing.

Comfortable family condo close to SHARC, trails, and more!

Enter the great room of this gorgeous two-bedroom vacation home and you'll swear - from the rough-mill Forest Service furniture with beautiful southwestern patterns, the lava rock wood fireplace, and the luxury, lodge ambiance  -  that you're in an upscale resort in Phoenix or Taos. No, you're in pleasant and colorful Sunriver, where the high-desert climate makes it a perfect place to get away no matter what the season! You'll be centrally located to hiking, biking, golfing, and every manner of winter sport!

44 Tennis Village will be your perfect home-away-from-home while attending your Sunriver Conference!  You are just a short walk to the Main Sunriver Lodge as well as Sage Springs Spa. You are also less than a mile from shopping at Sunriver Village Mall, the links at Sunriver Meadows Golf Course, and about three miles from Fort Rock Park where you can have a picnic and a game of tennis or horseshoes. There's fun in the water, too, at SHARC, the nearby aquatic center, with swimming pools and hot tubs. This home comes with unlimited use of 6 SHARC Passes.

Spacious and comfortable, the flood of sunlight through the floor to ceiling windows and the lovely contrast of rough-hewn woods against the white walls gives the place a warmth and intimacy belying its ample, 1400 sq. ft. of space. When it's chilly, throw a log on the gorgeous lava rock fireplace and catch your favorite show on the 42 inch flat-screen TV, watch a DVD, or dig into that magazine article you've been wanting to read. If you've got some business to do, head up to the loft, where you'll find a mini office with a desk, phone and free wireless high-speed Internet.

If you're looking to dine out, check out one of the seven restaurants in Sunriver. For many more options, make the half-hour trip to Bend. Otherwise, you'll do just fine with this fully equipped modern kitchen. Its white appliances and stone-tiled floor blends nicely with the rest of the home's decor. Your chef will be able to cook just about anything in this kitchen, complete with microwave and dishwasher. When dinner is served, sit down at the rough-hewn dining set with room for six that looks like it's been taken right out of a fairy tale!

44 Tennis Village will accommodate 6 people comfortably. The master suite is on the main floor. You'll not only have plenty of room in its big king bed, you'll also appreciate the adjoining full bath and another TV for late-night viewing. There are two queen beds, another bathroom, and yet another TV in the bedroom on the upper level. Up in the loft, there's also a day bed with a trundle.

Sunriver is flanked by the Deschutes River to the west. Throw a line in the river, ride the rapids, or take a leisurely kayak ride through the river's meandering beauty. Cyclists, bring your bikes! There are 33 miles of paved bike path leading to both pastoral beauty and shopping and dining in the Village. Deschutes National Forest is less than 10 miles to the east. That, of course, means plenty of places to hike, rock climb, or just enjoy scenic vistas. Closer to home is the SHARC aquatic center with its outdoor and indoor pools, water slides, tot pool, lazy river, and year-round tubing park. Come winter, skiers will find world class skiing at Mt. Bachelor, about a half-hour to the north. There are also sleigh rides, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, ice skating, and bonfires in the snow!

So make your next trip to Sunriver  comfortable and memorable. Stay in this beautiful condo close to all the activities and sites in the Sunriver/Bend area.

Very clean, comfortable,  had a well  stocked kitchen.

Great place, well equipped, quiet, and close to the lodge/great hall for the conference.  Comfortable bed, great kitchen, and other comforts.  excellent value.

Tennis Village 44 is a great place to stay, we really enjoyed it!  The condo has had lots of updating and is in great shape. Loved the log-style furniture throughout the unit, and all the bathrooms, kitchen, etc. had modern fixtures and appliances in working order.

Ours kids especially loved going up and down the stairs, and having their own rooms on the second floor, though at times it was hard to pry them away from the TV in the upstairs bedroom - a luxury we don't allow them to have at home.  :)

Only a few downsides - it can be a bit noisier than some places in Sunriver, being right next to Circle 1. However, this location is very close to the Village, so that's a plus - only about a five minute walk.  Also, the bed in the master bedroom is pretty hard, and I say this as someone who normally likes a firm bed. Hopefully this  is something they can address in a future update.

Enjoyed stay at Tennis 44.  Very comfortable and relaxing.  Loved location as was attending conference in Homestead.  Kitchen well stocked with utensils and dishes.  Would stay here again and hope others can join !!

We Loved our stay! We will be back ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ƒ

Very nice, clean and spacious.  We were in and out for a Wedding.  Wish we could have stayed longer and enjoyed the property and area.

We were in town for a wedding and found the condo to be very comfortable and conveniently located. It is a quick walk from the village shops, the Great Hall (where the wedding was located), and beautiful walking paths. Great place to stay!

We stayed here in early August. We are a family of 5. The condo accommodated all of us just fine.

Loved the nice towels and little hotel-like bathroom items (soaps, shampoo etc). Kitchen has all pots and utensils you need to make a meal. Having a washer and dryer is always nice.

The Sunriver area is lovely and makes a nice quick trip (we came from Portland-area).

There is no view, but the condo is in a quiet location that is conveniently located to most everything. We were fine without a view.

The couches are very comfy and it was nice to watch a movie there.

Nice loft area.

My husband and 2 of the kids visited the SHARC. It's fun but very crowded. Just an FYI, if you have a particularly shy child--one of my kids is very shy.

We didn't interact much with Vacasa staff. I booked online and received my confirmation email a week advance. It all went quite smoothly.

Overall, I thought this little home was a great bargain and we were satisfied with our stay. I would recommend it.

Our group of three adults and three children (ages 3, 6 and 7) had a wonderful stay. We appreciated the details like plush towels, matching dishes, nice glassware, a well-stocked kitchen, and a dining table that seats 6 comfortably. The high quality TVs and DVD players (awesome sound system) were perfect for movie night, and we enjoyed having board games and LEGOs available too. The kids were able to ride bikes/scooters in the circular parking lot next to the condo - it was much safer than the long parking lots by other buildings.

The location is great - right off the walking/biking paths, it's a short walk to the convention buildings (which is perfect if you're there for a convention like we were), the lodge and most importantly, the village. It's an easy bike ride to the SHARC, which the kids loved. Having SHARC passes included with the rental was ideal. Finally, the management company was superb - extremely responsive and courteous. Thank you for a wonderful vacation. We hope to be back!

This house is very clean, the kitchen is well stocked, and it is a great location.  The staff at Vacasa Rentals was especially helpful!

House was great, clean, and priced right. Everything we needed was in walking distance. Great place to go for people who like to be active and outdoors!

Tennis Village 44 was a very spacious rental.  It is a little dated, but nice.

The home was clean, and the carpets were really thick and warm.  The heating system heated the whole house, no cold spots.  The kitchen was clean and had everything we needed.  The rental fee also includes 4 passes to the community pool, which we did not use because it was winter when we stayed, but we would have used them every day in the summer.  We accidently locked the keys in the house one day and Vacasa was right on it, helped us locate the spare and we didn't miss a beat.  We will DEFINATELY stay here again.

Overall, a very nice property. We enjoyed our stay at Sunriver and took advantage of the bike trails and the SHARC Center. While in the area, we also rented kayaks and took a day long whitewater rafting trip on the Deschutes. The property was clean. We took advantage of the grill and enjoyed dinner most nights in the condo at the large wooden table. The large TV with surround sound and subwoofer in the living area was nice. Each evening we watched a family movie and had popcorn. The bedrooms are large and have TV's with cable. The kids enjoyed the WIFI on their tablets. The location is good with decent access to the more scenic biking trails in Sunriver with close proximity to SHARC, the shops, lodge, and golf. We had a good experience at 44 Tennis Village & would recommend this property.

Good location next to spa and exercise center.  Easy walk to village and SHARC.

My family of five (two adults and three older teens) had a great time at this condo. We went skiing and to the SHARC pool. The condo was spotless and very well furnished and had plenty of room. There were also several deck/patio areas that would be nice and relaxing in the summer or fall. We cooked several meals in the well-stocked kitchen and had plenty of space to relax and enjoy family time. The location is great - walking distance to the village.

I would definitely rent here again. The rental management were great - very responsive to all my questions and were able to offer us early check-in. Great condo and a very good value.

The fun at 3 Aspen Butte starts in the spacious great room, where everyone can gather to watch TV or sit around the fireplace.

If you like something more active, you are just across the road from Fort Rock Park, where you can play on the tennis courts, the basketball courts or the playing fields.  The home is also close to other action, including the new amazing aquatic center SHARC.  (Passes will be available in 2013).

Back at the house, prepare your meals in the well appointed kitchen and eat in the handsome dining area, or use the barbecue and dine al fresco on the fabulous deck. You'll love the unscreened hot tub that offers a view of the wooded surroundings - a real treat because most hot tubs in Sunriver are screened off.

This two-story home includes three tasteful bedrooms and two baths. Two of the bedrooms feature queen beds, and the third  one has a double bed and a twin.  The layout offers privacy and is convenient for any guests with limited mobility.

3 Aspen Butte has room for everyone  - and you can even bring your family dog. Whether you come here for a winter getaway or for fun in the sun, this will quickly become your favorite vacation home!

Great spot! Thanks so much

If you have small children, the house is a great location to Fort Rock Park.  It's a good location to just about anywhere in Sunriver since it's right in the middle.  It's not a private location however, there are houses close by on all sides.  The furnishings are nice, but the beds need new mattresses and towels need to be furnished in all sizes -- all we had to use were big bath towels and there were only 4 that matched and the rest of the towels were borderline rags and pool towels.  The hot tub was in great condition and is private.  Overall, it's a cute and cozy place.

This home was very comfortable for three couples and one toddler.  Appreciate that a high chair and safety gate is provided.  The kitchen is large and well equiped.  Location is perfect: close to the park, quiet street, and easy access to aquatic center.

the home is clean, bright, comfortable and well appointed. We would definitely stay here again.

This house is far from fancy but great for families and near Fort Rock Park which has playground/basketball/tennis. We enjoyed our stay!

We had such a wonderful Christmas at this house--it is so homey and warm, especially with the great fireplace!  Lots of amenities, fully stocked kitchen, and great furniture.  We recommend this house 100%.

The house had plenty of room for our family group of 8.  Enjoyed the backyard patio and hot tub.  appreciated the numerous trees close to the house which kept it somewhat cool during the 99 degree weather.  Had a large selection of bikes for the entire family.  The house was very well stocked with everything you might need in the kitchen or bathroom, etc.  Fans are a must in the summer at sunriver.  The house came with 3 fans.

We had never been to Sunriver so had no expectations and when we got to the house we were very happy with it! It was clean, lots of space and it did have AC! We will defiantly book this house again in the future!!!

Our family had a wonderful experience at SunRiver.  3 Aspen Butte was very accommodating, clean and well equipped.  The SHARC is a great place for all ages, we had a 1 year old and 2-4 year olds and the variety of swim areas pleased everyone.  Can't wait to go back next year - Yikes, that would mean 1-2 year old and 2-5 year olds.  Gpa & Gma had better stay in shape!

We were in Sunriver for a wedding and turned it into a week-long family vacation.  The house was perfectly situated to access all of Sunriver activities.  Golf courses were terrific; bike path access right off the patio, and trees kept the house cool and comfortable.  Overall, 3 Aspen Butte met all of our needs and enabled us to enjoy a terrific family vacation.

We decided last minute to take the kids to SR for Spring Break. Didn't expect much in the way of housing as we were last minute but we were pleasantly suprised by how well kept, clean, and comfortable this home was.  The place is well stocked in the kitchen.  The floorplan was very open and this made it easy to enjoy hanging out with the family in the common area.  We really enjoyed our time.  The back patio and the hot tub were in great shape.  Also, we were impressed with the large array of bikes available.  This home came with SHARC passes as well.  The only down side we could come up with is the other homes on the street.  One was going thru a remodel so the construction truck was permanently parked out front.  All in all I think any family would enjoy their experience with this rental.

This spacious Sunriver vacation home has amazing outdoor decks, a private hot tub, and a fantastic location near Fort Rock Park and the Woodlands Golf Course! Perfect for sunbathers in the summer and skiers in the winter, the home is a wonderful year-round destination.

With 2,100 square feet of living space spread across three floors, there is plenty of room for up to eight guests to share this sun-drenched home. The main living areas are on the middle floor, with beautiful windows overlooking the pine trees in the yard and skylights set into the beautiful exposed-timber ceilings. On chilly evenings, a large gas fireplace surrounded by leather sofas is the perfect spot to relax and watch a movie on the cable TV with DVD player.

The great room also has a large dining table for six (with plenty of space for extra chairs), perfect for sitting down to a special holiday meal. For casual occasions, the fully-equipped kitchen has a bar with two stools and overlooks a breakfast nook with seating for four. On the south side of the home, a sunroom with cozy chairs will beckon bookworms, and the desk with computer provides a nice home office for those who need to stay connected while away.

On the first floor, a master suite has a queen bed and private attached bath. There is a large open room that can be used for a second living space (with its gas fireplace and TV) or as an extra bedroom, since it has both a double bed and a twin. This floor also has a second full bath.

Up on the third floor is a delightfully cozy queen bedroom for one lucky couple, with a sliding glass door leading out to a private deck.

The south side of the house has a sunny barbecue area with a private hot tub, and outdoors lovers will adore this getaway. The spacious decks, proximity to Fort Rock Park and Sunriver's fantastic bike paths, and tree-lined yard will keep any family busy on pleasant summer days. In the winter, the cozy mountain decor and space for up to eight guests makes it a fantastic ski getaway! And, of course, your stay includes eight unlimited, complimentary passes to SHARC (the resort's lavish aquatic center).

House was nice. Deck could use some hammer work as some nails were sticking out (not a big deal). About 1.25 miles from sharc was a good ride for our 7 and 4 year old. Nice cool basement for hot days. Bikes were good but glad we brought our little kid bikes. Very happy overall.

What a wonderfully comfortable home. I have already recommended it to friends. I will return .

If you have guests who have trouble with lots of stairs another choice would be better. But if stairs are no problem , very nice place. Well furnished, beds a little firm though.

Plenty of room for everyone. Two private rooms. Note...the top level room can hear everything going on main level. Great view from private deck though. Surprised to find another bed (trundle) under one of the beds downstairs. Bikes for this location would have been great. Easy to rent at the village but a good ride back to the house. The hot tub was perfect and great to see all the stars at night.

The checkout process was quick and easy, appreciated that we didn't have to strip the beds!

Condo on golf course near SHARC with shared hot tub!

With two outdoor decks, a jetted soaking tub, and an unbeatable location right on the twelfth fairway of the Meadows Golf Course, this pet-friendly, two-bedroom Sunriver vacation condo offers something special for every member of the family! Within a few minutes, you can walk to shopping, dining, and galleries at the Village of Sunriver, or stroll over to SHARC to use your 6 complimentary passes to the new aquatic center, with its indoor and outdoor pools, spa, and tubing hill. And, of course, world-class golf is right outside your door.

With its central location near all the activity of Sunriver, there are plenty of ways to spend the day (whether you are a golf enthusiast or not!). Visit one of the Village's spas or browse the boutiques; head to the Deschutes River on a kayak or with a fishing pole; or rent a bicycle and explore the nearly 40 miles of paved bike paths spread throughout this forested resort destination. Of course, once the snow begins to fall, Mt. Bachelor's ski slopes are only twenty minutes away, while the ice-skating rink at the Village is just outside your front door.

The two-story condominium is part of a lovely shingle-sided duplex that makes a wonderful retreat at any time of year. In the summer, step out onto the log-hewn decks to enjoy your morning coffee in the fresh mountain air, or spend the afternoon watching the golfers on the course below. When chilly winter air blows in, curl up by one of the wood-burning fireplaces (that's right, there's two) and enjoy a cozy night in with the family.

The condo's great room and main living spaces are on the second floor, with plenty of windows allowing the sunlight to flow in and exposed timber beams for a delightfully rustic atmosphere. At one end, a cozy sofa and loveseat sit before the wood-burning fireplace, with the nearby cable TV with DVD player for movie nights.

Just past the inviting living area, a full kitchen offers everything you could need to prepare meals, including a dishwasher for easy clean-up. Choose from a perch at the breakfast bar, or gather the family around the six-person dining table for a home-cooked meal. On warmer evenings, head out to the deck with its gas grill for a barbecue!

The lower level of the house contains two bedrooms, one of which is a beautifully appointed master suite. A king-sized beds sits before a romantic wood-burning fireplace, with sliding glass doors leading to the spacious deck. The master bath has a relaxing soaking tub, the perfect spot to soothe sore muscles after a day spent whitewater rafting or swooshing down the slopes of Mt. Bachelor.

The second bedroom has two twin-sized beds and a futon, although the living room's sofa doubles as a sleeper if extra guests prefer to have a little more space. The closets are stocked with plenty of fresh linens and towels, and a washer/dryer is available for your use, as well. The house offers wireless Internet for working vacations or browsing restaurant reviews, and you can even bring the family dog along for the trip (a $10 per pet, per night fee does apply along with a $40 minimum per stay).

When you stay here at Central Oregon vacation rental, your only problem will be choosing the day's adventure!

We loved this cabin. It has a cute, rustic charm about it. It was located close to everything, which was a huge plus. My kids loved the jetted tub in the master bath and played in it for over an hour each night we were there. The roof top deck provided amazing star gazing at night. My only reservation is that our youngest is 20 months and there are a lot of stairs in the cabin, some of which did not have backs to them. We were initially concerned that she might fall through if she tried to squeeze her way through the stairs. Ultimately, she did fine and we never had any scares, but it's something to consider if you have very small children. Otherwise, we had a wonderful time and the cabin was great!

Booked this place for a weekend with friends. The location was awesome, but everything else was bad. The oven & stove are both 25-30 years old, and don't work properly. The freezer melted Ice Cream that we had put in. We found some weird sewing needle that had been rubber banded to a pen cap in the couch. One of the two toilets was broken when we showed up. Vacasa prides themselves on fixing things right away, and being this was our first stay with them, I didn't get that impression. You should probably choose another place to go with your hard earned money

I would highly recommend this property and I would rent it again.

Location is EXCELLENT.  Right across the village, 15 min walk to the SHaRC, 10 min walk to the lodge. Basically you don't need a car if the weather is decent.

The house was great, clean and had all that we needed. We had the 2 fireplaces on. Plenty of logs at the entrance of the house.

My only 2 complains are: coffee maker was not working (even though I called Vacasa we never got a new one) and there was not a dish sponge to clean those pots that don't fit in the dishwasher.

Besides these minor situations everything was great.

We had such a great weekend here and already can't wait to return. The location is brilliant for access to the shops, SHARC, and main Sunriver entrance. The unit had everything you could need which makes packing really easy, and was super comfortable. We really appreciated being able to bring our dog, however I would mention to other small dog owners that you may want to pack a gate or barrier. There are lots of gaps between steps where a little dog can get through, and ours unfortunately fitted through the top floor balcony railings and fell about 15m to the ground. Thankfully no broken bones and that is certainly not the fault of Vacasa - just a word of caution to small dog owners.

Great location close to the village and SHARC. Nice place with all amenities.

The Wildflower was perfect for what we were wanting. The location is prime, the cleanliness was beyond and it was supplied just as described. We had four adults, 2 kids and a dog and was perfect. You can't go wrong with the price either. Going to book again soon, only this time for a week.

The space was wonderful and had everything we could've wanted. The village store was a nice and quick walk away even in the snow, and there were plenty of paths to walk our dog. The kitchen had all the space and tools a cook could want and the dishwasher was a nice treat. And Mount Bachelor is only a 20 min drive away, we would recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and quiet retreat.

Hardly anyone around this time of year.  Had great birthday celebration for my wife with just our young girls and dog.  Comfy fireplaces, an older but relaxing jacuzzi tub, family games, movie, tubing and swimming at sharc, and a nice breakfast at Meadows to cap off the weekend.  Great time.

We stayed at Sunriver for 3 nights.  The unit we were in was very nice and spacious.  It had everything we needed.  There are many walking/bike paths which we took advantage of.  The Village shops were not as pricey as I thought they might be.  It was a great break from home.

This is a no frills house but it is also very reasonably priced. Would not recommend it if you are not up to climbing the 20 steps between the entrance and the kitchen/dining/living room. Most houses we have rented have a few spices. We only found some salt. That aside the location right across from the Village is perfect. Our two dogs enjoyed strolls in the pathways and it was fun to see deer right under our deck. The jacuzzi tub is heaven!

Great place to stay!  Our family enjoyed our vacation and especially loved the SHARC center.

Wildflower 5 was so close to everything! We were very pleased with our first visit to Sunriver and will be back again for sure! The condo was larger then we imagined and had plenty of room for our family of 7. Very clean and quiet!! Would stay here again!!

Overall my experience along with my families was outstanding and the value was incredible!

very relaxing. thank you.

Spent a 4 day weekend in Wildflower Condo #5.  It was comfortable; the king bed was nice and firm and we slept very well.  The jetted tub was fun after a long day of skiing.  You could walk across the street to the Village Mall with restaurants, grocery store and an ice skating rink.  We had passes to Sharcs but were skiing all day so did not get to use them.  Would definitely stay here again, and our dog liked it too!

The location of this condo is great.  Very close to shopping, SHARC & bike paths.  Condo was clean and well maintained.  We would stay there again.  That being said, if you plan on cooking in the kitchen, you will need to bring your own plastic wrap, foil, ziplock bags & pizza cutter, as these items are not provided.  In addition, the 190 degree water tap (for tea, coffee, etc) in the sink puts out cold water.   Really though, these are my only complaints.  We had a great stay and would return again.

vacasa people are great to work with, the house was exactly what I was looking for. Subscriber was a blast, ice skating within walking distance. Store, shops, pool- everything you need and you don't need to leave subscriber. Awesome!

This condo is very well equipped.  The kitchen had everything you could possibly need (except a corkscrew).  It was spacious and the furnishings very comfortable.  There is a large 'step down into' jacuzzi in the master bath with twin shower heads.  My husband and I opted to shower in the other bathroom as this one seemed a little tricky operating and getting out of.  (we are 60 and 65).  Condo would be great for a family.  The location is PERFECT and Vacasa folks are so helpful!

Great location within Sunriver. Condo has everything you need. Enjoyed our visit.

The pollen was bad when we went the week of June 11th. We could literally see the yellow pollen blowing in the wind. If you have allergies you might want to choose another month.

Blue Goose is the kind of Sunriver vacation home you dream about, with its tasteful lodge decor, well appointed kitchen and panoramic windows overlooking a peaceful woodland setting and filtered river view. Best yet, when you walk out your back door, yor're right on the banks of the Deschutes River. This make Blue Goose a rare treat, because very few residences in Sunriver back up to the water.

The gorgeous, roomy home easily accommodates up to 10 people, plus pets. The great room is a main attraction, thanks to its impressive stone fireplace and plush furnishings. You and your guests can watch cable or a DVD on the new flat screen TV, listen to music or throw your own karaoke party right on the spot.

At mealtime, you'll have no problem preparing any kind of cuisine in the full gourmet kitchen. Enjoy meals around the handsome wooden table, or slide open the deck door, cook on the gas grill and eat al fresco. After dinner, there's room for everyone in the large outdoor hot tub.

Blue Goose features two master bedrooms, both with king beds and top-of-the-line bed coverings. One master is on the main upper floor with both a walk in shower and a jetted garden tub, and the other one is downstairs. That floor also features a bedroom with a queen bed and wood accents, and a room with two sets of twin bunks, so four kids can have a ball! A pack-n-play is also provided. For more relaxation downstairs, you'll find a roomy, comfortable lounge area with an entertainment center with a new flat screen TV and a sleeper sofa.

When you're ready to explore the area, hop on one of the bikes in the garage or take a short drive to Sunriver Village for shopping and dining, as well as ice skating in winter. For summer fun, you can also enjoy the nearby golf courses, tennis courts, stables and marina.

As an extra treat, you receive 10 free passes to SHARC, the amazing aquatic center. Children and adults alike will love the tubing hill that's open all year, plus the pools, play areas and so much more.

This place is great.  Large and comfortable, plenty of room to spread out.  The evening river view from the deck is great.  The kitchen had everything we needed (except waffle iron). The place was just right for our two families.

The house was very comfortable.  Scenery was beautiful and the stay was quiet and restful

Enjoyed our stay at this house. Surroundings were beautiful!!  Everything was stocked in the house, no need to bring your own cookware, linen or grilling supplies.  Bedrooms were very private from each other and best of all, it was quiet and peaceful around the property.

This was a great house, very nice and quiet location.  We were located a little far from SHARC and the village  so we ended up driving  to those  attractions.   Tons of room for all ten of us. I would stay here again.  Something to remember,  there were plenty of bikes for us  to use but only one helmet.  Oregon State helmet law for children 16 and under, we did not know of this law.  Yes, we were stop by the  police bike patrol and given a warning.

We loved the location of this house- so close to the river and to the biking paths.

It felt isolated, which we appreciated.  The layout of the house was perfect for our group.

Year 2 for President's Day Ski Adventure - House performed admirably for a group of 8 adults and 5 kids...Plenty of room for everyone!  2 entertaining spaces made for easy separation of "church & state."  Well equipped for any eventuality.  Minor inconveniences (trash compactor, bathroom fan, some jets in Hot-tub, bike maintenance,  knife sharpening) were easy to overlook with ample activities to occupy our time (blue skies, skiing, BEER!).  We'll definitely be back.

We haven't been to Sunriver for several years, and I really enjoyed the ability to make the reservations online, print the PDF Home Guest Book prior to arriving to the site was great!  Customer Service was great, as well, when we added 2 days to our stay.  Thanks for the great experience!

Nice layout and space for our family of seven. SHARC passes were convenient and a bonus of the house. Do bring your own bikes until the bikes there are replaced or fixed. The bike paths are throughout Sunriver. The house is 2.4 miles from the village and a nice ride or walk.

This home was ideal for our vacation. The weather was up and down like a yo-yo (snow, sunshine, rain) but the house made it enjoyable no matter what the weather. Having wood for the fireplace was a real plus on those snowy and dreary days. Sunriver is a neat place to stay but is like navigating a maze for driving. I'd recommend the "Circle 8" app for your iPhone to help find you way around the resort. It cost $0.99 but is well worth it. Other than our issues with the grill, we have no complaints.

BIG - 4 bedrooms with 2 master SUITES (no fighting for the little bed) in the North End of Sunriver - Close to Golf, relatively close to Sharc, but a good distance from the village (not walking distance)  Easy jaunt to Mt. Bachelor and Bend.  Home was in great shape...Kitchen is well equipped for cooking for a big family.   2 distinct entertaining levels that makes Adult and Kiddo separation easy!  Hot tub was new(ish) and super well maintained, plentiful bikes for use.  We will definitely consider using this property again!

Location, location, location.  This is a nice home centrally located in Sunriver.  I choose homes in this location frequently and have never been disappointed.  Great home for a reunion or large group.  Thank you.

The home and surrounding area were awesome. The home and all of the amenities were as advertised. I would highly recommend this property to my friends and family. We had a great time.

We had a wonderful stay in Sunriver, and 11 Blue Goose St. was the perfect home for us. The owners of this property had thought of everything and we didn't really need anything beyond our clothes and food. The house comes with bikes, karaoke machine, games, firewood, a ping pong table... you name it. My daughter had a stuffy nose because of the dry air and, lo and behold, they had a fancy humidifier in the house. That's paying attention to detail! We can't wait to come back to Sunriver and 11 Blue Goose St. will be the house we look for.

Overall we enjoyed the house and would consider renting the house again.

Nice home with many amenities. Close to the river, great for XC skiing. We liked the setup  and walking for an inter-generational family.  We would rent again if the cost was lower.

This home made us feel like we were "home". Everything was well apportioned, kitchen was well stocked with lots of plates and utensils. The beds were very comfortable and sheets were soft. We will be back again. What a great house and friendly staff! Thank you.

Great place. Our family has stayed here before and would do it again.

We enjoyed the rental in Sunriver.  Everything was great and it made it easy to meet up with family from Boise,and really felt like a get-away.

We just returned from 4 nights at 11 Blue Goose.  The house is very comfortable with plenty of space for folks to spread out.  The kitchen had plenty of cooking utensils and dishes to easily accommodate 10 people. I appreciated that upon check out there wasn't a long list of things to do/clean and that I was getting my money's worth from the cleaning fee.  To say it has a view of the river is a bit of a stretch.  The river is very close from the back of the house, but is not actually visible because of the trees.  The only other criticism is that several of the loaner bikes don't work well.  So if you like to bike ride, you should take your own.  Otherwise we had a great time and hope to return some day.

This luxurious home is one of the finest  Sunriver vacation rentals - perfect for families or corporate gatherings. With giant timber framing, a two-story stone fireplace and distressed hardwood throughout, it feels like you're staying in a classic mountain lodge.

The house, which overlooks the second fairway at Woodlands Golf Course, sleeps 14 and features amenities for all generations. You can enjoy a game of ping pong, play on the fabulous pool table trimmed with rustic logs, or check out the touch screen for entertainment controls. Use this screen to access thousands of songs - and to adjust the heat and air conditioning as well!

This home is great for entertaining, with a gourmet kitchen featuring two dishwashers and two sinks. It has a full serving buffet and a custom granite table that seats 14, with four more chairs at the kitchen island. You can also enjoy eating on the patio right next to the golf course. After the meal, stay outside and soak in the new eight-person hot tub, or head to the stunning living room to watch a movie or gather around the fireplace.

When you're ready to venture farther afield, you can use the seven adult bicycles to ride the miles of bike trails crisscrossing Sunriver. You can also take a short walk to the Deschutes River for fishing, floating or other fun. As another plus, the home comes with 12 free passes to SHARC, the incredible new aquatic center. You and your guests will have a blast at SHARC's pools, play areas and year-round tubing hill.

Back at Vine Maple, you'll find five bedrooms, five full baths and two half baths. Three of the bedrooms are master suites that include king beds, TVs, DVD players and mood lighting. The downstairs master suite features heated floors, a jetted tub and a touch screen for music. A queen bedroom and a bunk room with six twin beds round out the sleeping accommodations.

Vine Maple is in north Sunriver, a beautiful area that features easy access to Highway 97. The home is near a major tennis facility, a quiet pool area, and The Marketplace, which sells everything from groceries and liquor to souvenirs.

Guests who stay in this luxurious Central Oregon vacation rental lodge rave about its gorgeous design and amazing amenities, and they call it the best place to enjoy a family vacation. Why not give your family and friends a treat and find out for yourself?

Excellent place !  You will not be sorry, it is well worth the money spent.

A lovely, well supplied and well maintained home with plenty of room for a big group to share space comfortably.

It truly is a wonderful and beautiful home and the kitchen has everything you would ever need.  However, the descriptions lists 7 adult bikes...this is not correct.  It's more like 3 adult bikes and 4 kid bikes.  The advertised 7 adult bikes helped make the decision of renting this property...needless to say biking was not an activity our group was able to do.  Other than that...it is an amazing property.

We had such a lovely time  staying at your home! Relaxed, enjoyed, had a beautiful Christmas!

This home is absolutely stunning! Beautiful furnishings and gorgeous views. Accommodated a large group very comfortably. Highly recommended!

I truly believe this to be the best house in Sunriver!  It's quite new, massive, and the finishings are all extremely high end.  Plenty of room for our family, and plenty of space to spread out.

This house was perfect for a family vacation.  Very spacious, wonderful furnishings, and very warm and inviting environment.  Everything we needed was right there from the laundry room, kitchen, bedding etc.  We had a great experience and would highly recommend to anyone visiting this area.  Thank You!!

It was a pleasure to stay at this property which met or exceeded all of our expectations.  Despite a weather caused power outage, this well maintained and appointed home was a highlight of our trip.

Our organization rented this house for a work retreat.  We had 11 employees there and there was plenty of room for everyone.  Four of the five bedrooms have king or double beds and the other room has two beds with two bunks and a trundle.  We ended up taking some of the mattresses from the trundle and bunk beds and using them on the floor for people to sleep on.  One bunk bed in particular was very rocky and putting adults in the beds could have been dangerous.  One downside to the house is that it is very electronic and we had a hard time figuring out how work get things to work.  The television is a big problem.  With Monday night football and baseball games determining who would go to the would go to the world series we had some unhappy campers.  With two people working on the TV using remote controls and the electronic wall panel we finally got the TV on but it needs to be made so everyone can use it.  The hot tub seats 8 people and was enjoyed by many of our staff.  One of the best things about the house is the 5 full bathrooms (one in each bedroom) and the two half baths.  We had a problem with one of the shower/tubs, it didn't drain very good and the two people using that bathroom had to turn off the water and let the tub drain before they could continue with their shower.   All and all it's a great house, we would absolutely stay there again.

This home is incredible, down to the very small details.

Our stay at Vine Maple in Sun River was three days of action, feasting, and fun.

We fly fished on the Crooked River, golfed the Woodlands (awesome), hiked green lakes, biked all around SR, swam at SHARC, played ping-pong and pool and topped it off with a soak in the spa at the end of each day.  Sweet!

This is the best home we have ever stayed in.  It was wonderful.  There was so much to do and enjoy in this home we hardly left the property. Great place!!

Our family had a wonderful time at this residence  in Sunriver.  The children were so happy with the space and amenities this enormous, beautiful home had to offer.  The mothers were extremely happy to have a great kitchen, and a working washer and dryer!  The home had many high tech things that we were not familiar with how to operate, but the instructions next to the panel was very helpful.  Thank you very much!

We love 13 Vine Maple.   It really is the best place to have a family vacation.  There is something to do for all ages and just a great house to spend time with your family or friends.

This lovely three-bedroom Sunriver vacation home is tucked away among the pine trees on a quiet cul-de-sac, yet still close to all the action of Sunriver! Walk to Fort Rock Park or to use your complimentary passes at SHARC (the brand new aquatic center with year-round facilities), take the provided bicycles out to explore the 37 miles of paved paths, then return to your Conifer Lane retreat to soak in your private outdoor hot tub.

This shingle-sided vacation home feels very laid-back and relaxing, yet offers plenty of amenities to make your stay extra-special. In the open living area, a wood-burning fireplace is built into an exposed brick hearth to make movie nights especially cozy on winter nights. Settle into the overstuffed sofa, loveseat, or armchair, each with an excellent view of the flat-screen television with cable and DVD player; or, gather the family around a board game at the coffee table.

Just beyond the living area, a dining table sits near the tall windows so you can enjoy the peaceful forest views as you share meals together. The adjacent kitchen is fully stocked with all the pots and pans, dinnerware, cooking utensils, and dishes you need to cook for a larger group, and there is even a gas grill on the spacious outdoor patio for summer barbecues.

The house has three bedrooms and two full baths, with the spacious master suite on the ground floor. Here, a king bed sits below windows overlooking the pines, and an attached bath has a walk-in shower, making the house comfortable for guests who may have mobility issues or want to avoid stairs.

Upstairs, the second bedroom has a comfortable queen bed for a second couple, and the third bedroom has two extra-long twin beds. Down in the living room, the sofa unfolds into a queen-size sleeper to accommodate extra guests, with plenty of fresh linens and fluffy towels for up to eight guests.

When your group is ready to head out and explore Sunriver, the house comes equipped with a few extra amenities to get you started! You'll find eight unlimited passes to SHARC, the resort's brand-new aquatic center with year-round facilities, and a collection of bicycles for adults and children (please bring along your own helmets) to explore the labyrinth of trails snaking through the resort. You can pedal to the Village at Sunriver, with its coffee shops, restaurants, brewery, boutiques, and galleries; each of the four Sunriver golf courses; and any number of grassy parks. The closest, Fort Rock Park, has a baseball diamond, picnic tables, and playgrounds, and lies just a few minutes' walk from your front door.

Sunriver's summer activities are well-known and nearly endless (hiking, mountain biking, golf, whitewater rafting, fly fishing, and more); but in the winter, the resort becomes an excellent playground for skiers and snowboarders. Mt. Bachelor's powdery slopes lie just twenty minutes away, and the surrounding areas are full of sledding hills, cross-country trails, and the beautiful Sunriver ice skating rink even closer to your home away from home, with plenty of hot chocolate to please the less active guests. Although, with a fire crackling in the hearth and that private hot tub waiting just inside this Central Oregon vacation rental, a quiet night in may prove irresistible!

This home has been recently updated and it shows.  The kitchen and bathrooms are beautiful.

The living room has a great view (set back from the biking trail a bit for privacy) we saw 4 different sightings of deers casually walking by.

The location is perfect, with a quick and easy walk to the park and bike trail.  And a short bike ride to the SHARC and Village.  Definitely central to the best of Sunriver.

Recommendations to future visitors: Bring or rent your own bikes.  Although there are several in the garage, most are out of commission.  Also, if you have little ones you might want to bring a stepstool, some of the counters are a bit high.

This was a very cute house. Older but very clean and cute. The new hot tub was awesome, it was very close to fort rock park, which was great for letting the older boys ride there bikes down to play basketball. Very quiet, and relaxing. It was a little cozy for 2 families of 4,  but doable. We are planning a trip next summer and will most likely stay here again.

Love the deck and the spaces work nicely.  The location is great near the Park.  very quiet with a beautiful wooded view.

I really like the location here.  It provides a lot of view and privacy.  The only one thing that was not pleasant was that we were locked out for 4 hours.  There was only one key in the lock box.  We went out to buy grocery and after unlocking the door, we accidentally left the key on the kitchen counter.  After trying to get more groceries in, we suddenly realized that we were locked out due to the feature of the double lock.  We were not warned ahead and were only given one key.  It was Monday morning 9:30.  We arrived previous night, so this was our first day and we didn't carry the property management's phone number.  We had to find neighbors to help.  We kept calling for the property management office but only got the answering machine.  We left a few messages and still no one called back.  Our neighbor gave us their management office (Sunset Lodging) to help, they were extremely helpful.  They sent an email to our property management Vacasa.  We didn't hear from them and had to hire a locksmith from AAA but the guy was not able to unlock it for us (    ).  He decided to phone his wife and asked her to keep calling Vacasa for us.  After 4 hours they arrive and open the door for us.  We didn't have breakfast and lunch till 3:00.  We were hungry and tired.  They were only willing to refund $90 (half of the day) but our plan for golf was ruined.  We only stayed for 4 nights.  On the 3rd night our internet was suddenly logged out while we were enjoying our dinner watching neflix.  Vacasa told us they would take care of it the second morning.  They second day they told us we had to call the broadband company because it was their problem and nothing Vacasa could do.  We explained to them how important it was for us to have internet and it would be our last day here and we didn't want to spend a day trying to get through the line with broadband, etc (we did cal and only got the answering machine).  We pleaded Vacasa to help fix the problem and they showed up right away and reset the machine and on we went.  After all had happened, I must say that, although I was not happy about them not answering calls, but Vacasa immediately fixed the problem-  they answer the call immediately after all that had happened.  Obviously they care about their business and I am happy with that.  They are trying to do things right.  Internet breaking down was not their fault but I had a feeling that they would do better in the future in informing their customers what to do.  I respect people who is willing to correct their mistakes and make their customers happy.

We really enjoyed our stay at Conifer Lane. The Fort Rock Park is within walking distance which was great for our 3 year old son. The house is also within walking distance to the new Sharc water park and the Village (if you walk along the bike path). The Sharc passes that come with the home are a huge bonus as well. It costs $25 per person for admission to the Sharc center so it was nice to have the passes included. We will definitely rent from Vacasa again. My only recommendation would be an upgrade to the old King mattress in the master bedroom, it was very uncomfortable.

There are 10 or 11 bicycles of varying sizes located in the garage.  The conditions ranged from very good to barely rideable.  There is a tire pump, but no tools to adjust seats, tighten wheel nuts, etc.  One of the three speed bikes had only one operable gear. There is one small helmet.  Renters should be alerted to the fact that children 16 and under MUST wear a helmut, and that no helmets are provided.

This lovely home is loaded with amenities to entertain a whole group. Bring your extended family (including the family dog), come with a group of golf buddies or friends from work, and you're guaranteed to have a great time!

The fun starts in the spacious great room, where everyone can gather to watch TV or sit around the fireplace. Speaking of TVs, there's one in every room in the house so all generations can see what they want, or golf fans can watch a tournament while baseball lovers cheer on their team. One bedroom even features PlayStation for kids of all ages.

If you like something more active, you'll find foosball in the garage, plus bicycles to explore all over Sunriver. 7 Awbrey Lane is just across the road from Fort Rock Park, where you can play on the tennis courts, the basketball courts or the playing fields.  The home is also close to other action, including the new amazing aquatic center SHARC. You get 10 free unlimited use passes to SHARC, with its pools, play areas, year-round tubing hill and much more.

Back at the house, prepare your meals in the well appointed kitchen and eat in the handsome dining area, or use the barbecue and dine al fresco on the fabulous deck. You'll love the unscreened hot tub that offers a view of the wooded surroundings - a real treat because most hot tubs in Sunriver are screened off.

This single-story home includes four tasteful bedrooms and two baths. The master bedroom has a queen sized bed and an attached bathroom.  Two other bedrooms offer queen sized beds, with bunk beds and a trundle bed in the fourth bedroom. The layout offers privacy and is convenient for any guests with limited mobility. You're also welcome to bring up to two dogs with you, though be aware that a $10 nightly, per-pet fee (with a $40 minimum per stay) will apply.

7 Awbrey Lane accommodates your entire gang in style. Whether you come here for a winter getaway or for fun in the sun, this will quickly become your favorite vacation home!

Awesome time with family.  Open floor plan was great for family time.

Family and friends had a great time for my wife's birthday celebration. Large, clean, quiet (except as noted below), very nice overall, with one or two minor exceptions:

The hot tub area has *no* lighting, at least as far as I could find. (I hope I didn't just miss something, but I'm pretty sure!) Eventually we left the blinds open in the master bedroom, which is right next door, but that was kind of weird. And this darkness actually led to my sister-in-law tripping over the stair to the tub and breaking a tooth and hurting her shoulder! (Before we figured out about the bedroom light, that is.)

Also, with the hot tub immediately next to the master bedroom, the noise was rather bothersome. At times it was *really* loud. If you have problems with this kind of noise (I don't but my wife does) then you may not want to stay here. I couldn't find any way to turn the thing off - I'm guessing that you can't, which makes sense - and even considered popping the circuit breaker for it, but instead my wife slept on a couch for one night, till she could get to sleep.

That makes things sound bad, but we totally would consider staying here again!

My experience was excellent the property was great and so was Sunriver as always!

Great floor plan.  Awbrey 7 was adequately equipped and would easily handle 10 people.

Worked well for ten which included four children, My two adult children and spouses, my wife and I.  Large enough so that other family members staying nearby spent most of their time in our cabin.  Nearby Fort Rock and Bike trails were great.

We were more than happy with renting this house! It was big enough for our large family and we were so pleased it came with bikes and a ton of games! The kitchen is well equipped and the overall house was very clean!

Quite, relaxing, The kitchen  was very well equipped  and nice  to work in.

The house was great.  Exactly as advertised.  We were a group of 3 adult couples and 1 dog and there was plenty of room for all of us.  The living area was very comfortable with lots of good seating for everyone.  Our visit was a little disappointing because there was no snow - but that had nothing to do the house or Vacasa!  Our only recommendation about the home would be to replace the frying pans - the non-stick coating is chipped and starting to come off into the food when used.  Otherwise, the home was extremely well equipped. We would definitely come back.

We had a wonderful time weather was perfect. A very happy and memorable thanksgiving.

Great place for family stay. Lots in the area to do. It was nice to be greeted by the deer every morning and evening.

The home was spacious and comfortable for family of six (two adults and four teenager). Close to Fort Rock park where the kids could walk and enjoy plus just a short ride to the SHARC center. The only negative that I have is the nails to the deck kept lifting up which could be a potential toe getter.

The house was perfect for our stay. There were 7 adults and 3 dogs with us. There was room for everyone. The beds were very comfortable. There were plenty for all of us. Great house, good location.

Great layout, comfortable furniture, SHARC passes were nice to have, and we appreciated the games in the closet and the extras in the kitchen (popcorn popper, espresso maker and crockpot) as well as the sleds, bikes, and foosball table in the garage.

great home,had everything we needed.Really liked the overall layout of house

We appreciated finding a dog friendly place that didn't require a full week's rental during Christmas week. We had a very nice time and would highly recommend 7 Awbrey Lane to others. Thank you!

Great house! We loved our stay at 7 Awbrey and will be staying there again! The layout of the house was fantastic, the furnishings great and the hot tub warm and toasty.  A perfect home away from home for our group!

Our group had the best time at this house! The open layout with the huge fireplace made us feel right at home. The hot tub was great too! I am counting the days until we can book this home again, best one I have stayed in yet in Sunriver!

This house is located just around the corner from a park and is quick drive to the Sharc Aquatic Center.  We enjoyed the quiet of being located on a

culd-de-sac and the hot tub was a big hit and we were greeted by a family of deer every morning. On the upside, it has plenty of space for a big family, has 4 bedrooms and enough beds for all 5 of my kids to have their own beds!  Unfortunatly, the master bedroom mattress is very hard and uncomfortable. I would still recommend this house to friends, with that one concession.

What a great getaway! One of the best vacation experiences the family has had. Great accommodations, great location to activities and shopping all around INCREDIBLE. Looking forward to coming back again!

The house was very clean when we arrived, complete with fresh boquet of flowers. The house was well equipped with all the comforts of home.  We like ranch style house. Terrific location, next to Fort Rock Park and quick easy ride to SHARC.  Appreciate all the SHARC passes.

Escape to the serenity of Central Oregon and enjoy this beautifully appointed house in the woods. Situated on a private, one-acre slice of the Deschutes National Forest just outside Sunriver (approximately 4 miles south) this lovely home is perfect for a large family or smaller families vacationing together.  The home is on the way to Mt. Bachelor, so it is 10 minutes closer to the ski resort than the average Sunriver home.

After a complete remodel in 2012, the single-level house includes loads of amenities for all generations. You'll find a movie theater sound system, more than 50 DVDs, a Nintendo Wii with 10 games, a poker table with cards and chips, and a large collection of books and board games. Indoors, there are flat panel TVs in every room, or you can head outside for the seasonal campfire pit, hammocks, and tree house.  Please note that no pets are allowed at this home.

Relax in the welcoming living area, and make delicious meals in the fully stocked kitchen. You can eat in the  dining area, or go on the deck to barbecue and enjoy your food at the patio table overlooking the trees. After dinner, luxuriate in the seven-person hot tub and watch the deer and other wildlife pass by.

With three bedrooms and two full baths, the house comfortably sleeps nine. The queen and king bedrooms have new pillow-top beds and handsome wood accents, while the third bedroom features a triple bunk bed plus a trundle bed for two.

With all these fabulous amenities, it can be hard to leave the house, but you'll also want to explore the recreational activities nearby. You're just 500 yards from the Deschutes River, and the home comes with eight bikes for kids and adults. Ride a quick three miles, and you'll be at The Village, with its delightful shops, restaurants and even an ice skating rink in winter.

This wonderful home really lets you feel at home. You'll want to return often to enjoy all the fun possibilities indoors and out. **Please note - SHARC passes are not included with this rental.

The home is very nice, clean, modern.  Hot tub was nice and clean, right off the master bedroom.

We rented this home as a last minute getaway for myself, my husband and our toddler. It was better than what I was expecting. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. The house was spacious and the hot tub was AWESOME! Definitely appreciated that it was located right outside the master bedroom. So glad we rented this house vs. going with a hotel. We had everything we wanted and needed for a relaxing getaway.

The house was spacious, very clean and comfortable.  We had 6 adults (2 couples and 2 singles) and the space worked very well for us.  The patio was very nice to enjoy the surrounding woods.

If you are looking for a great place outside of Sunriver this is it. Our two families (4 adults, 4 kids) had a great time relaxing and visiting near by attractions. The only potential down side to be aware of that this is outside of Sunriver so easily biking from here to Sunriver biking trails is not achievable with safety in mind with young kids. You will need to drive a few miles with the bikes to get to the trails. That said I did not ding my rating for this because I have been to the area enough to know this before I even booked the house yet something for others to be aware of.

Hot tub, tree house, fire pit, bikes! And indoor games galore, including Wii. Very thoughtful people. Plenty of supplies:) cool triple bunk bed. Beautiful rooms.

Our family loved this vacation home. It had everything we needed and also many things we didn't know we would need. Thank you for having so many entertainment activities geared towards families in the home.

Everthing was very clean, stylish, and comfortable!

We will definitely stay here again when we come back to visit Sunriver.

Me and my wife came here as a retreat and we loved the place, it is beautiful on the inside and lovely outdoor setting from the Xterior. We really liked being so close to band, we went there to shop for the day and then we came back after we shopped and enjoy the comfort of the hot tub since it was raining. Perfect place for couples as well as families

Great service and happy people to deal with. Great property. Would stay again for sure.

This house is very nice and clean! We had a great weekend with fun in the hot tub and relaxing in front of the woodstove! Thank you for a great stay!

I've stayed in a few homes around Sun River and this one by far is my favorite. Since the home is surrounded by trees and quiet neighbors, you definitely get the feeling that you're "away from it all" while still being close to downtown Sun River if you need to get things. The house is surprisingly well stocked for all your needs (no need to bring your own olive oil or aluminum foil!)  and nicely labeled. The hot tub is HUGE and very clean. I had a couple questions during my stay and it was very easy to reach the staff at Vacasa and they were quick to find a way to solve my problems. Talking to the owner directly was also a very nice added bonus. Six adults slept comfortably although there's room for 8, plus cushions for the floor--great place for kids too, lots of games and videos/TV/Wii. I will definitely be renting here again!

The house is very comfortable and neat. Definitely would reccomend!

Actually liked that this wasn't in the resort area. It was clean and well organized and an easy place to stay at.

We had a great time at this home. It is peaceful and beautifully decorated and has everything you need. We loved the location and privacy as well. Thanks very much!We will return!

This was a fantastic property. My husband and I planned a last minute getaway. We definitely plan to return with family to enjoy the property more. It is on the outskirts of Sunriver, which we enjoyed.

Overall, this is a great home and well priced.  It does sleep nine and we had 8 people (two families).  It was comfortable but a bit small for two families of 4.  The deck was nice and the kids loved the hammacks.  The distance to the resort bike trails is not bad, however we drove to them versus riding because Century Drive is just to busy to ride bikes. This was not a big deal for us as it is such a short drive.  The owners have done a nice job with the decor the home is very welcoming.

This was our first time renting a vacation home.  It was a wonderful way to spend a week.

We enjoyed our stay, the house was very clean and it had everything we needed.

We enjoyed our stay at this home. Newly remodeled and fully equipped kitchen.  There we several deer that showed up and hung out every morning and evening.  The kids enjoyed the tree fort.  The distance to sunriver village was a bit too far for a bike ride and also too busy a street to ride with kids. Otherwise, a great house!

It was an wonderful place.  Very quiet, very comfortable and good supplies.  I like the fact that there we condiments there so we didn't need to buy salt, etc. Even had bikes (we didn't use) but if I would have had my grandkids that would have been a nice extra.

So relaxing and fun! We're not even home yet and know we'd love to come back. We'll be booking again real soon!  - Julie Goodman , Sherwood

We had an absolutely wonderful time at SunRiver last weekend! Your home was cozy and comfortable and spacious enough for all 7 of us. It was so well equipped that it felt like home and we would love to come back soon.   Thanks again for the great vacation experience.

Huge home w/private hot tub and sauna, space for 12, pets ok

With five bedrooms and over 2,200 square feet, there's room for the whole family (including the furry, four-legged ones) to relax and enjoy a Central Oregon retreat here! This Sunriver vacation home is located on the first fairway of the Woodlands Golf Course, offering great views and numerous resort amenities.

The large and open downstairs is bright thanks to lots of large picture windows, and nicely decorated with colorful throw rugs, comfortable leather furniture, a slanted wood ceiling, and a wood burning fireplace for keeping warm on chilly, snowy evenings. Read a book while sitting on the cozy window seat or set out snacks for everyone on the coffee table, after a long afternoon hike. There's a wall-mounted, flat screen TV with cable for watching movies or the game, a surround sound stereo system, and WiFi for researching restaurants or checking email.

This open space includes a large dining room table that seats eight and extra seating right at the breakfast bar. In the kitchen you'll find everything from a refrigerator, stove/oven, and dishwasher, to a coffee grinder, a mixer, and a toaster. As easy as it'll be to go out for meals at one of the resort's six restaurants, you can just as easily prepare as many vacation meals as you'd like, right in your own kitchen - be it toast and granola to start the day or a make-your-own taco party for dinner!

Right off the living room and dining areas is a large deck overlooking the golf course. Settle back in one of the comfy Adirondack chairs and watch the action on the fairway, sip some ice tea, or enjoy a glass of wine after dinner, while enjoying the cool breeze. For an extra dose of relaxation, there's an outdoor hot tub on the deck as well. Let the water soothe your muscles while you gaze up at the stars after a full day cycling or snowshoeing on the trails at Sunriver. On nice evenings, fire up the gas grill for a steak and vegetable skewer dinner.

Two of the bedrooms are equipped with twin-over-full bunk beds, each with bright bedding and comfortable accessories. The other three bedrooms each have a king sized bed,  providing a snuggly space for everyone in your group. All of these bedrooms have stylish details and two of the king rooms even have their own have deck or balcony access. This home will comfortably sleep 12 guests, including two dogs with a $10 per day, per pet fee ($40 minimum per stay).

Additionally, there are three full bathrooms, including a Jacuzzi tub and a private sauna. Other amenities include a laundry room with a full sized washer and dryer, and a VCR, as well as a ping pong and foosball table. Everyone in your group will find something to entertainment them here, whether it's a family ping pong tournament, spending afternoons walking on the trails near the house, relaxing in the hot tub, swimming in one of the many pools, or just staying up late each night reading in bed. Also Vacasa provides 12 complimentary SHARC recreational passes, as well as North Pool passes for the maximum occupancy of this home.

Sunriver is a family friendly resort community located in the stunning Oregon high desert. With amenities like horseback riding, swimming pools, miles of paved trails, and world-class golf courses, it's no wonder that the resort is such a popular family destination!

While this home is right on the Woodlands Golf Course, the resort boasts three others - Meadows, Crosswater and Caldera Links, all offering challenging play against a scenic, high desert backdrop. Additional activities include horseback riding and sleigh rides around the holidays, miles of paved trails for biking, hiking, cross-country skiing in winter, or just walking the dogs, and the Sunriver Homeowners Aquatic & Recreation Center (SHARC), with its outdoor and indoor pools, a lazy river, two water slides, shared hot tubs, and more.

Just off the resort grounds, Sunriver is near a number of outdoor adventures, including guided outdoor tours of caves and volcanos, whitewater rafting, waterfall mountain bike tours, paintball, rock climbing, skiing at Mt. Bachelor, and fly fishing on one of the many scenic lakes and rivers in the area.

For a memorable family vacation or a getaway with friends, this comfortable five bedroom Sunriver home has it all! A great location within the resort, amazing amenities, and it has an easy commute to skiing, shopping in nearby Bend, or just exploring beautiful Central Oregon.

In a sentence, we didn't want to go home!  The snow arrived Dec 24 giving us the white Christmas we desired and the kids were thrilled to have sleds provided in the garage.

While due for updating and minor repairs (ie a doorframe got into a tangle w/ a previous dog guest), the house was clean in the right locations:  most notably the kitchen and toilets.  Would prefer no carpet in the master bath, especially around the commode, and the caulk around shower doors could use a bleach pen, but I did not doubt the cleanliness of the shower itself.

The kitchen is well-appointed with a nice variety and amount of tools and dishes.  Appreciated the provided firewood, laundry soap, dishwasher detergent.  Nice also to have bikes, ping pong, and foos ball in the garage.

Layout of bedrooms worked well for our party of nine (6 adults, 3 kids).  Please note, that the blue bedroom w/ bunkbeds is on an end of the house apart from other bedrooms.  While I'm sure this would work well for older kids or braver ones than my own, my three (ages 7-12) opted to room together in the bunk room across from the master.  I could understand their reticence to use the downstairs room as I would not have been able to hear them if they needed me during the night.

House is nice and light with many windows.  The two window seats were a favorite.  View of golf course and pine trees was lovely.  Overall house was homey and cozy and we would return in a heartbeat.

Even though the house needs some updating, I think the size, location,  layout, hot tub, fireplace, and dinning room table, made this house worth renting.  I would consider it again in the future.

Property has a lovely deck on the first hole of the golf course.  The weather was perfect - the Village has been remodeled and is a lot of fun to walk through.  Lovely place for a little getaway.

This home was in very poor condition.  We had issues with the BBQ, the carpets are so dirty you never want to remove your shoes, there was food all over the couch when we arrived, we had to was dishes that were crusted with old food, the shower head in the downstairs bathroom was broken, there was a missing blind in the master bedroom that let in the morning sun, the hot tub was broken and unusable our first night there.....  I could go on, but you get the picture.

Great location with lots of amenities. The private sauna and hot tub are excellent features along with bikes and ping pong available for personal use at the house.

we stayed at this house to celebrate the holidays, since some of our family was ill during the holidays. it was my family, my parents, my parent-in-laws and my sister-in-law family. altogether there was about 8 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 toddlers. we choose this house cause it was supposed to sleep 12 people, but this house was in poor condition and i would not recommend it to any large groups. many of the beds creaked every time anyone moved, making a good night sleep rough. some of the sheets were in poor condition and the kitchen left room for lots of improvement. the basic features of the house, like the big fireplace, hot tub, dining room table were nice. it was the little things, like pots, pans and sheets that need some upgrades.

when we arrived at the house, we realized the microwave was not working and the living room had popcorn kernels all over the furniture and floor. We have toddlers, so we had to pick these up so that no one choked on them. i called the property about the broken microwave and they told me someone would be by the next day. Later that day we were not able to get any hot water out of the bath tub, for my toddler's bath. the property suggested we turn up the water heater. After we turned up the water heater, the water was warmer in the house, however, there was nothing in the instructions for the house stating that we needed to turn it up to begin with. the pots and pans in the kitchen all need replacing, they are old and there was only 1 large frying pan, which makes cooking for 10 people difficult. all of the frying pans have the teflon peeling off them. the oven had a temperature probe sticking down in it, that was so low, it was almost touching any tray we put in the oven. the gas grill outside only had one tank of propane, but since the kitchen was in such poor shape, this was how we cooked most of our food. after day 2 at the house, no one had come to see the microwave so i called the property again. it was later that day when a guy came out and after looking at the microwave, he determined it was broken. he came back with another microwave shortly and left the broken microwave in the garage. the curtains or blinds in the whole house need some attention, one of the bedrooms the curtain wouldn't go down all the way and all of them didn't work so great.

list of complaints:

-popcorn kernals on floor upon arrival

-broken microwave

-oven had probe that hung down low in food and was not well vented

-stove top took a very long time to heat any pots of water, etc

-pots and pans were very old, most had teflon chipped and there was only 1 large frying pan available

-water heater had to be turned up all the way to get warm water in the house

-there was only 1 propane tank for gas grill, which is where we had to cook most of our food, since the kitchen wasn't properly working

-most of the curtains were broken, one of king bedrooms the curtain didn't go all the way down

-a few doors near laundry room had been chewed in the lower corner, like someone locked their dog in the house

-most of the sheets were in poor condition/torn

Compared to the condition of the property in previous years, this was a great improvement.  For fear that the barbeque was the same old one,  I went out and bought a small one to use before we came up.  Was I glad to see the new one.  The new dishwasher was a pleasant surprise.  The old router for the internet was so slow.  The new one operated quickly.  We had planned to look for a new place on this trip but didn't because of the property's improvements.  Will schedule again for next year once we figure out our schedule for next summer.

Quiet home with private hot tub and near golf

When you stay at 14 Cherrywood, you instantly understand the meaning of "location, location, location". This vacation home is situated on the quiet, peaceful north side of Sunriver - just a stone's throw from the Woodlands Golf Course and the North Pool and Tennis Complex.

The house is surrounded by bike paths, so bring bicycles or rent them and enjoy a short ride to all the amenities of Sunriver. Check out the Village with its shops and restaurants, and Fort Rock Park, which features everything from sports fields to basketball courts. You also get 8 free passes to SHARC, the extraordinary new aquatic center. You and your guests will love the pools, play areas, year-round tubing hill and much more.

After your hours of fun, you'll appreciate the comforts of this reverse living home, recently upgraded with new carpeting. Relax in the great room with its vaulted ceiling, large windows and wood-burning fireplace - and head for the connecting the kitchen to prepare your meals. You can eat in the dining area with its large table, or step out onto the deck to barbecue your meals and enjoy them outdoors. Don't miss a soak in the hot tub to end up each day.

Upstairs, you'll find the master bedroom with a queen bed, a handsome bathroom and a powder room. Downstairs, there are two bedrooms - a bunkroom with three sets of twin bunk beds, and another bedroom with a queen and a twin. A hall bath plus a washer and dryer round out the conveniences on the ground floor.

14 Cherrywood is a prime place for family and friends to relax, but when you're ready for action, it also offers easy access to Highway 97 and nearby Bend. Enjoy the "big city" for nightlife, dining and retail therapy, and then come back to your Sunriver retreat.

Great location, very clean! Would rent again. Very happy with our choice. Bunk room was perfect for the kids!

A great stay for our family over the holidays! On the positive side the couches/seating in the living room are very nice. Having a wood burning fireplace with lots of wood was awesome, kitchen was well equipped, bikes to use were great, hot tub is in good condition, layout of the house with the living room and master up was nice-great views out to the trees. Big dining room table for everyone!

Some things could be improved: The beds weren't too comfortable. Linens are older and mismatched. Location is 10 minutes from Sunriver Village, could be closer. Not too big of a deal when weighing the reasonable cost.

Deck furniture was scarece, dirty, and cheap. And the design of the deck made enjoying the property while sitting not possible. Wooden tables and chairs inside were old and the finish was constantly sticky. The floors creak, there is no AC (it was 95+ inside every day), carpet is dingy and every single knife is DULL. Add all this up and this house screams at you that the owners and managers are only concnered about rental revenue and not providing a rental experience that matches what they charge.

Loved the stay was a little warm with the partial ac but the windows felt awesome! Thanks again for everything would def stay again!

Overall the place is great - hot tub, lots of bikes, abundant kitchen supplies, clean. Older folks may not like the beds - my parents and older siblings found them hard to sleep in. And the yellow bike carriage did not come with instructions on how to attach it to a bike, which was a bummer. We wanted to carry our little ones around but could not figure out how to attach it ourselves  -  it seemed like it didn't attach to any of the bikes there actually. So one of us had to walk around pulling the carriage, which of course the person grew tired of very quickly. Otherwise the rest of the bikes were fun and we appreciated having them there. Overall, very nice house. My second time staying here.

The good;

Location was great and the size of the property was perfect. Lots of room. Hot tub was hot and clean. A little dated but good. Kids had a good time.

Needs improvement;

The beds need some work on softness. Get an HDMI cable for the TV. HD tv and stuck in the 90's.

For the price point it was perfect and would definitely stay again. Thank you!

14 Cherrywood is a lovely place , well-located, decently appointed, beautiful views, bathrooms/plumbing very convenient.  Very nice layout, convenient beds downstairs for kids. With those tough stairs, it sure would be nice to be able to park in the garage though.

I also loved the comfy chairs in the living room, and nice big table.  Me and my 3 kids were there to ski at Bachelor, and it was so nice to come home to Cherrywood Lane!

I would highly recommend this home to anyone coming to stay in Sun River.  The home was perfect for our family, kitchen was stocked with what we needed and the home was very clean and comfortable.

Lots of beds (7 singles and 2 queens I think) and space for large families.  The price was very reasonable.  The hot tub was not huge but 4 fit comfortably.  Lots of wood for the fireplace and several bikes that were not listed in the ad.  Unfortunately most of them had flat tires and the bike pump didn't work or we would have spent some time riding the numerous bike paths around sun river.  Several golf courses within easy walking distance, one surrounding the group of homes on Cherrywood.  Hope to stay there again sometime.

We loved our stay at this home.  Home had everything we needed and was clean.

Very nice house, hot tub is a nice touch! This property had everything we needed plus bikes in the garage. We had a terrific time this weekend, thank you!

Enjoy this cozy vacation rental condo in one of the best locations in Sunriver. You'll be staying right next to The Village with its fun shops and restaurants - and even an ice skating rink in winter. You're also just down the road from SHARC, the amazing new aquatic center. The vacation rental condo comes with six free passes so you and your guests can enjoy SHARC's pools, play areas, tubing hill and anything else that strikes your fancy.

You receive great value with this two-bedroom, one-bath vacation rental condo that's recently been renovated. Relax and watch TV in the comfortable living room, and cook your meals in the updated kitchen. You can choose to eat at the dining table, or barbecue your dinner and dine out on the deck.  This ground floor unit provides accessibility for everyone.

At night, you have the choice of two bedrooms - one with queen bed and the other with two twins - plus sleeper sofa in the living room.  In any event, you'll sleep well in this fun condo in the middle of all the action Sunriver has to offer.

One of a group of beautifully decorated vacation rental condos, 3 Abbot House is part of a the Sunriver community that includes amenities like swimming pools, two championship golf courses and more than 30 tennis courts.

There are two adult bikes and one child bike included.

Clean, everything we wanted except no AC but found closing everything up in the day and opening at night worked just fine. Nice deck, bikes and the location was perfect for anyone who doesn't want to spend the day driving. We are not athletic so being able to walk to the store, restaurants, art galleries in just a few minutes was wonderful.

We loved your location, easy to get in and out but still had access to all  attractions in Sunriver!

Very outdated property, but as close as you can get to the mall as possible which is very convenient.

If you plan to spend much time biking you should bring your own bikes.

The location was great.  The grocery store, shops and restaurants were across the parking lot and easily accessible.  The SHARC facility was not at a walkable distance, but was easily biked or driven to.  We LOVED that we had unlimited access to the SHARC facility during our stay.  The condo itself is very old and does not have air conditioning, but it is clean and comfortable.

Great location:  right next to the village, biking trails, short walking distance to the SHARC.  This was our first time here and if we visit again, we will definitely stay in one of these condos for the convenience, quietness, and furnishings--loved the bikes that were provided.  The check-in/check-out process is awesome:    only takes seconds and you are on your way!

Nice place to stay and located near all the important things.  Real close to SHARC and the Village and the Store.  Makes for an economical stay in a not so economical Sunriver.

Beautiful accommodations and great weather made for an excellent weekend!

We have stayed at the Abbot Condos before and really like the affordability and convenient location.  This was our first experience with Vacasa and I will go directly to them the next time I'm looking for a rental.

Our unit was very clean and the check-in/check-out process was amazingly convenient.  I loved not having to find the office to check-in. We had easy access to everything we wanted to do.  Very much appreciated the SHARC passes.

We got a great chuckle out of the check-out instructions reminding us to take our cell phone chargers - which we probably would have but for the reminder!

Thanks for being part of our best Christmas ever.

Abbott 3 is a great value.  The condo is very well equipped with many extra amenities.  The location is excellent. Steps to the village and adjacent to biking paths as well.  The condo itself is older but well maintained.  The only complaint we had was that the beds were quite "squeaky"  but that can probably be easily remedied.

Abbott House 3 was very well equipped even including sporting equipment, golf clubs, tennis rackets and balls, and other things.  The unit smelled fresh and clean when we first opened the door and the location is perfect, the village is right next door.

Very nice clean,quiet,close to everything,place to stay.

very conveniently located, small, cozy, clean, well maintained condo - enjoyed the stay

My husband and I have stayed in many hotels and vacation homes over the years. More often than not I feel like they are not quite as clean as they should be. To our surprise this condo was beyond our expectations. Attention to detail is an understatment!!!!! Everything was spotless. How nice not to have to worry about "cooties". (smile)

you can't go wrong with this property nor the property management service!  very clean, well-stocked and amazing location and the management is quick to reply and offer any help needed.  this unit has it's own self-enclosed deck which isn't specified and is really nice.  the kitchen had everything we needed and the beds were super comfy with nice sheets and pillows.  i'm very picky about cleanliness and it was very clean even though it's dated in some areas.  we will definitely visit sunriver again and stay with vacasa rentals.

This condo is not big. It felt very cozy for 5 persons. However the price was right. Furthermore, it is located right next to the Country Store. Finally, it was equipped beyond my expectations: SHARC passes, wi-fi, grill, bikes, games...

The only issues that we ran into were fairly minor. There was no extra toilet paper only what was on the roller. Had to go buy extra. Also could never get the locks on the garbage areas to open so had to leave it in the condo when we left. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay very much and will visit Sunriver again.

Sunriver is a great place to take a family on vacation. The village has everything you could possibly need. The atmosphere of Sunriver is outdoors and recreational at its best. We rented boats from the Village and the staff was very helpful to insure we had a great time. The area around Sunriver is loaded with new and exciting things to do and see. We stayed for 4 days but I would recommend at least a week so you have time to enjoy everything.

With a large outdoor deck overlooking the forest, a cozy old-fashioned wood stove, and a fully-equipped kitchen, this two-bedroom Sunriver vacation rental offers a wonderful resort getaway!

Only two blocks away, beautiful Fort Rock Park has a children's playground, tennis courts, and softball, sand volleyball, and basketball facilities. Guests have six unlimited passes to the SHARC facility with indoor/outdoor swimming pools, water slides, and lazy river is just over a mile from your door, and you can take advantage of six unlimited passes that are included with your reservation! Within two miles of your front door, you can play a round of golf and access all the dining and shopping of the Village at Sunriver.

With an open floor plan and a set of double doors leading to the sunroom and outdoor deck beyond, the main living areas of the home are always bathed in natural light.

The warm and cozy living area has an old-fashioned wood stove set into a romantic stone hearth, and tall shelves stacked with books and games. Select a title and settle into the sofa for a quiet afternoon, or grab a board game to spread out on the coffee table with the whole family. There's also a TV with satellite cable for laid-back movie nights.

Through the living room, a warm hardwood-covered solarium offers a nice break between the indoors and outdoors, with an expansive deck just beyond the ample picture windows and sliding glass doors.

The kitchen overlooks the living area, and is fully equipped with all the appliances and supplies you could need to prepare meals (including a dishwasher for easy clean-up). The six-person dining table sits beneath a lovely stained glass lamp, and there are a few additional stools at the breakfast bar.

The lower level of the home has one bedroom, furnished with one queen and one twin-sized bed. The adjacent bathroom has a door to the bedroom and the living area, for both privacy and convenience.

A staircase leads up to the spacious loft, where the second bedroom has a queen bed and private bath. While the house comfortably sleeps five adults, two to three children could easily bring along sleeping bags and bunk in the solarium's loft.

This spacious vacation rental is ideally located in the geographic center of the Sunriver Resort, allowing for plenty of peace and quiet right around you, but still close to all of the resort amenities. You can spend your days biking the nearby trails, splashing in the resort swimming pool, or hiking in the surrounding national forest; in the evening, return to all the comforts of home in your own private retreat, quietly nestled among the trees in the heart of the Sunriver resort.

If you prefer not to drive at all during your stay, you'll be able to reach everything on the resort by foot, or hop on one of the bicycles furnished for your use (including five for adults, one tandem, three children's bikes, and a bike trailer) on the resort's nearly forty miles of paved trails.

In the winter months, Sunriver is less crowded but just as lovely to visit! Of course, Mt. Bachelor is only twenty minutes away, with world-class skiing and snowboarding (not to mention some truly impressive sledding hills).

The Village at Sunriver has a seasonal ice-skating rink for magical winter nights, and you can top it all off with a hot chocolate or glass of wine in front of a crackling fire at your own Central Oregon vacation getaway.

It is a good location and a great architecture for a 2 BR condo/cabin. Property is old and has no updates that's something to keep in mind before you rent it. Everything works and well maintained.

Perfect weather!  We enjoyed sitting on the deck enjoying the birds and breeze.  Comfortable home for my friend and I who came down for a wedding.  Each had our own bath and privacy.  We enjoyed the great selection of books (Curious Customs was very fun!)  And had fun riding the bikes!  Thank you.

Very appreciative of the call about leaving two bicycle helmets and bike lock although they weren't ours.  Nice to know people care about others personal property.  :)

Enjoyed our time in sunriver and surrounding areas. The Rental was ok. Good location,but some cleaning and heating issues. They provided several bikes, one tandem, and firewood. Very hot upstairs and cool downstairs. The Deck is nice with chairs and picnic table. Must see the Newberry volcanic monument.

We had a good time in Sunriver.  This was a nice place to stay and it was well represented by the pictures.  The only issue was getting the keys.  The code provided did not work on either the front door lock box or the lock box on the garage.  We had to call Vacasa to get an alternate code.

We had a wonderful stay. The house was very clean, very cozy, and its definitely a place we would stay again. The only issue we had was when we got to the house around 1130pm, anxious to get inside we found out that the lock box code that we were given was incorrect. Other then that we had an amazing time in Sunriver.

This property was more than adequate for a couple and their adult daughter for the weekend.  The layout was very odd with a master suite upstairs that you entered by a stairway from the patio.  Windows were very small so the house had many dark areas.  The resort was very crowded with wait lines at all the restaurants but that is to be expected in August at Sunriver.

We enjoyed our stay and wish we had stayed a day longer. We enjoyed grilling out on the deck, taking multiple bike rides and tons of swimming. The weather was very warm, with the house having no ac it would have been nice to have a third fan for the living area. Thankfully the nights cooled down so we all slept very well.  Will definitely be back again.

Overall we were satisfied with our experience.  The house has an odd layout but for a few days it was fine.

We had a great little family getaway.  The place was perfect for what we needed and the Vacasa staff was great to deal with.  Thanks for everything...

Sunriver is a place for a family needing quality time together!!

Nice cabin close to Fort Rock (children park). The heating system appeared to have been retrofitted. Coupled with thin windows, it made for cool spots. The open floor plan also caused the upstairs to be significantly warmer. This open floor plan also means that there is no sound barrier between the master bedrooms and both the kitchen and the living room. On the other hand, the kitchen is very well stocked with pots, pans and other tools. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

Not a bad place but could use a little maintenance.  Some energy efficiency improvements would also help, especially for those winter stays.

Very cozy house, we stayed in the winter and it stayed very warm with the fire place.  Has all the basic ammenities and centerally located.

About an hour after arriving we managed to lock ourselves out and left a "Help" message on the Vacasa recorder.  Within 20 minutes they called us back and had us back into the cabin in no time.

Loved that this house had all the basics and all I needed to do was bring clothes and food! Easy breezy!

This place is dark and has poor layout. Bathrooms are very outdated. It was extremely hot on the loft area in the afternoon when the outside temperature is around 70's. We can't imagine how hot it will get when the temp is around 80's. No wireless is bummer. We can't say enough to describe how disappointed we are. We likes Sun River and come here every year for vacation. We would not stay in this place again.

What an amazing little cabin in the tree's. My two children 10 and 11 spent the week here before Christmas. We had a fire every evening, made amazing dinners, went sledding and played games (provided). The house was very clean and comfortable.  We will for sure rent this place again. Excited for the new pool and slides. Thank you for letting us enjoy your cabin!

Melissa, Thomas and Samantha

We loved that there were bikes for many sizes, including a trailer for the young ones!

Absolutely loved our trip!  Can't wait to return! House was immaculately clean and full of charm. Thank you!

Went here for a two night stay, Had a great time. The bike trails were fun and the setting was beautiful. I rode quads at East Fort Rock which is only 50 min away. Much more enjoyable than a hotel. Had a wood fire stove, and could play cards at night. Very satisfied

You'll love this well appointed, centrally located Sunriver vacation rental.  Not far from all the action - Fort Rock Park, the shops and restaurants in The Village, and the marina with fishing, float trips, kayaking and canoeing, this beautiful three bedroom vacation rental home with room for up to eight is not far from SHARC, the new amazing aquatic center. When you stay here, you get  8 free passes to SHARC's pools, play areas, year-round tubing hill and much more.

This spacious vacation rental home features the split-level floor plan that is classic Sunriver. Upstairs, you'll find an inviting great room and a large deck overlooking the woods, which gives you the feeling of a treehouse. In the living room everyone can relax around the TV, and at mealtime, you can cook up anything you like in the well appointed kitchen. You have your choice of where to eat - at the kitchen island or the spacious dining table, or on that wonderful deck with gas barbecue.  And, of course, the hot tub is just down the stairs of the lower deck.

The home includes three bedrooms and sleeps 8, so it's perfect for a group of golfers or an extended family. The Master bedroom is located on the top floor.  The master bedroom has its own bath and a cozy king bed in moose and bear-themed bedding. There are two bedrooms and a bath downstairs, with two twins and a king bed.

This is the kind of roomy and comfortable vacation rental where family and friends can spread out and enjoy themselves. One group can socialize on the deck and someone can watch a ballgame on TV.  That's not even mentioning all the fabulous activities right outside your door. The only problem you'll have at 2 Tan Oak is deciding how to enjoy this Central Oregon resort first.

we are easy going folks so of course we had a great time, but somethings that would have really made me give this place two thumbs up and make it want to rent it again,  is...  fixing the large burner on the stove, more water and less chemicals in the hot tub, better lighting on the stairs to the front door and an easier to use door knob, also a new shower curtain in the down stairs bath, and the advertised tee-pee for our kids to play in was no where to be found.

We loved this house; it was a nice size for 5-6 people, well laid out, but lots of stairs. The fishing theme in the living room was fun.

The dishes were plentiful and lovely. The hot tub worked nicely. The beds were comfy. No partying neighbors, so it was quiet. The steep driveway made it a bit tricky to get in and out of the car, but it wasn't icy when we were there.

We would stay here again!

We had to buy portable fans to help cool the house and we ended up throwing some of our food out that went bad due to poor refrigeration. To keep the food cold we alternately froze some  items then placed them back in the fridge to help keep the other items cold.

Overall was a good time and nice facility.   But seriously you need to either have more fans or install Air Conditioners. .    They have this new Ductless system that works great or since you already have a duct system in place just need the A/C.

We had a great time during our recent stay at sunriver and 2 Tan Oak was perfect for our needs. The location was great - close to all the main facilities, the setting beautiful and very peaceful. The house was clean, very well stocked and the beds comfortable; but we did feel that it could do with some modernizing and the decor refreshing. That said we would definitely recommend the property and stay there again.

This newly remodeled Sunriver vacation rental has something for everyone in the family to enjoy: a spacious outdoor deck, two romantic master suites, and even a kids' bunk room packed with toys and games! And, of course, your stay includes 10 unlimited, complimentary passes to SHARC (the resort's lavish aquatic center), multiple tennis courts, and miles upon miles of biking and walking trails. If your trip falls during the winter months, you'll find world-class skiing and snowboarding only twenty miles away on the slopes of Mt. Bachelor, and a magical ice-skating rink in the Village at Sunriver.

The spacious four bedroom vacation rental sits on an over-sized wooded lot tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac, so you can enjoy a considerable amount of privacy and solitude while still being in the heart of the Sunriver resort. In the summer months, the most popular spot to kick back and relax in your new home-away-from-home will certainly be the expansive outdoor deck. Gather around the patio set with umbrella for a game of cards or to enjoy dinner in the fresh air.

When the air grows chilly, the beautiful great room offers a warm and cozy place for everyone in your group to gather together. Sink into the plush sofa or recliner, put a movie or the big game on the 50" flat-screen with cable and DVD player, and build a toasty fire in the handsome wood-burning fireplace. With one wall of floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the pine trees, you can still feel as though you're in the great outdoors even while cuddled up by the hearth.

On the other end of the great room, a dining area and fully-equipped kitchen make it easy to prepare and serve meals, even for a large group. The kitchen is nicely stocked with all the pots and pans, dishes, cooking utensils, and dinnerware you might need, as well as a dishwasher for easy clean-up. The table, perfectly positioned by the sunny windows, seats six to eight guests, and there are three extra spots at the breakfast bar.

With four bedrooms and four full baths, the house has been designed to share with multiple families or several couples traveling together. Younger guests will make a beeline for the brightly-painted kids' room with a bunk bed, additional twin bed, and plenty of toys and games. The lower level also has a comfortable queen bedroom, and the living room's sofa unfolds into a sleeper for extra guests.

On the upper level, a laid-back family room separates the two master suites, each with its own king bed and private bath. Sharing the space is even easier with a washer/dryer, and each bedroom has its own TV to avoid disagreements on which movie to watch at night. There is plenty of space for up to twelve guests, with room for everyone to spread out and do their own thing, or gather together for a board game marathon or hearty breakfast.

And you'll need that breakfast! Sunriver and the surrounding area are famous for outdoor recreation of all kinds. From your front door, it's a quick walk to Fort Rock Park's playground, basketball court, or baseball diamond; meanwhile, golfers will find four courses to choose from. The resort has miles upon miles of trails for bicycling or walking, with many more challenging hikes in the surrounding national forest. Kayakers, rafters, and fishermen will love the proximity to the Deschutes River, and skiers will be in heaven with Mt. Bachelor only 18 miles away.

Less outdoorsy types can enjoy a leisurely stroll to the Village Mall for a relaxing day of browsing boutiques and art galleries (just over a mile and a half from the home) and there are two grocery stores close by for those last-minute items. And of course, kids will adore spending the afternoon at SHARC, with its indoor/outdoor pools, lazy river, and water slides.

The house was big enough to not be tripping over our two 2 year olds and 2 four year olds.  And the toys that were at the house were a pleasant surprise and fun for the kids.  The SHARC was totally awesome and we would plan to come back just for the fun that both our families had playing there.  Overall this is a great value.  The property is pretty 'well loved' but for the shoulder season price and the space we'd definitely do it again.  And for the record the listing says there are no bikes but there are 5 kids bikes and 3 adult bikes and there are instructions and keys to the hot tub that is on the porch.  Not sure why the listing says that the hot tub is 'shared'?  Enjoy!

A couple of cleanliness issues but nothing that would prevent another stay.  We had a wonderful weekend for 3 sisters and loved our stay.  Location was great, so quiet and peaceful.  Nice, large house with plenty of room.

We did some serious cooking and found every dish, pan, bowl and gadget needed. There's a highchair in the closet, bikes in garage including two for small children. Toys and legos kept the baby and four year old occupied while inside. Nice, private yard, big deck with comfortable chairs. Dark sky at night. Comfortable beds, lovely house but not too fussy. What more could you want?

Loved 6 wikkiiup!!!!  Would definitely stay here again. Great floor plan for 3 families. Well stocked with towels, to, soap, shampoo, etc. Thank you for sharing your family home with ours. Fun memories were madeðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜Š

Great for place for 4 older gentlemen to stay. A bathroom for each!

We rolled the dice on an early October golf outing.  One would normally expect a frost delay pretty much every day.  We were blessed with lows in the 40's and highs in the eighties all four days.  It could not have been any better.

The food and the service in the Village was excellent.

The rental property was "as presented" on the web site.  There were no surprises!

we enjoyed the spaciousness... not too large, not too small.  we did not get to enjoy the deck due to weather, but the ones who went skiing had a great time.  shopping in Bend was a fun time as well.

Great layout for multiple families! We had the best time! :)

We loved our stay at this VaCasa rental home! It was very comfortable, had all the amenities needed! We loved the on-site hot tub, and the bicycles for touring around the Sunriver bike trails. The 2 Master Suites were great, and provided plenty of privacy. This house is located on cul-de-sac and we didn't have any street or traffic noise at all, its a very quiet area.  We would definitely stay at this house again! VaCasa Rentals made renting this house super easy, all reservations were made online, we didn't have to go to a main office to pickup keys, just show up at house and open key lock-box  for house key, and that's it!

We chose this home because it was large enough to Sleep our large group and had an excellent price. We were not one bit disappointed with our decision. It was perfect. Equipped with everything you need in the kitchen and plenty of books and games and movies for the kids. It's in a great location in the middle of sunriver. We will surely stay here again.! Thank you to the owners for such a beautiful home to vacation in!

Our family stayed at the house and had a terrific experience.  The house was fully furnished.  The surrounding neighborhood was extremely quite.  Lots of deer.  Hot tub was outstanding.  Air conditioning could be improved (air set at 65 degrees during heat of day but didn't notice a change) but it cools off at night so its not a major issue regarding cooling the house.  Family enjoyed the new hot tub.  Overall wonderful time.  We will return in the future!

We really enjoyed our stay here... plenty of space for 3 families (6 adults and 3 kids, ages 4-7).    Our only recommendation would be to include instructions on how to best use the a/c... we had a difficult time keeping the house cool, especially the second floor.  But overall, we loved the house, and would love to come back!

We loved staying at 6 Wickiup. We had three generations all stay at the house together (grandparents, parents, and three kids ages 2-5). The house had ample room, furnishings and things to do. The hot tub was a great touch at the end of the day and we could enjoy the stars from the warmth of the tub. The only thing we would have changed was that a couple of nails were starting to pop up on the deck and the littles ones stepped on them in their bare feet. Otherwise, the house was great!

Wish we could have stayed longer!  Nice house in quiet area.  Only problems listed above.  Would definitely stay again especially if the A/C is repaired.  Very easy to book with Vacasa.

We are planning to come back very soon. We had a baseball tournament, so we really didn't get to experience sunriver like we would have like to. Can't wait to come and have the time.

This home is located in a great location, everything is easily accessible by bicycle. Also, there are bathrooms for every bedroom which is a major plus. The extra family room came in handy for an extra get away space for kids and adults. We will definitely be staying here again.

The house is comfortable and plenty big enough for the whole family. It's a little far from the activities, bring bikes or rent them so you can ride around and don't have to drive. WIFI would have been nice.

Overall we enjoyed our stay in this home, the amount of space very much met our needs. We would likly look at staying here again if certain things were changed.

Thank you ! We loved your home!

Very nice home. Large bedrooms with small but complete baths. There is no wi- fi so bring a hotspot if you plan to work. This home is excellent for families. There are family rooms on both levels.  This home is hard to find. It is off circle 4. You will need a map if you do not know the area. I would recommend this home.

This home is a great place for a large family gathering.  We had 3 families in the home and the separate bathrooms were greatly appreciated.  Loved the two deck table and chair sets...we were able to be outside during the heat of the day and find shade.  Really appreciated the 10 passes to the SHARC center...the kids loved that place and could have spent entire days there.  The location of the home in the  Wickiup cul-de-sac was perfect for our young bicycle riders...there was very little traffic.  It was a great find.  Thank your for sharing your lovely home.

The house was actually better than I expected. The separation of the bedrooms, plus 4 baths, was a huge plus and provided sound sleeping for 8 people (5 adults, 3 kids). The layout would be hard to beat. The immediate environment was also great, providing a nice woodsy feel.

Although it is not next to any of the popular sunriver locations, it is close enough to not be a problem. Furnishings were nice, and the rooms are all a nice size. Extras included numerous books and maps, games, videos, TVs in every bedroom, plus family room and loft. Overall the condition was good. Unexpected extras included fishing poles and golf clubs (not tested for functionality). The spa was nice as well, the patio furniture was very comfortable. Excellent washer and dryer.

The negatives were:

No wifi. This was a serious issue for three of us, so I made numerous trips to Fort Rock park to use the public wifi. I knew it didn't have wifi, but still found it more of a problem than I expected.

Condition of the bikes. My son is able to fix almost any bike, but we were hard-pressed to get any of them functional for our use, and ended up borrowing two adult bikes from friends, and renting two bikes for the 8 and 11-year olds. Bike issues included shredded tires, wobbly axles, and many dangerously worn brake pads. Maybe others would find them useful, but we didn't. I'd suggest either fixing those that can be repaired or locking them up to avoid potential accidents.

Finally, the kitchen: silverware was of poor quality and the biggest problem was no sharp knives for cutting. We found no knives that were useful for cutting.

Regardless, we greatly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to rent again, especially if the wifi was added. Having the Sharc and tennis passes was a big plus, and the area offers endless opportunities for enjoyment.

We enjoyed our stay. With a few fixes identified in the property condition section of the review, this place would be very desirable. Although I knew from the description that internet access is not provided, that would be a plus if added.

The house was great and had  everything you could possible need,could use a cutting board and wi-fi. Great location with easy access to everything.Would highly recommend it.Thanks we had a great stay.

I've been to SunRiver many times and this is by far the best house I've stayed at.  Loved it. We're planning to come back next year and stay a week.  Very little clean-up to do before departure as well.  Thank you!

The house was very comfortable for 10 people.  The outdoor setting with the pine trees was very relaxing.  There were plenty of bikes provided for riding the trails.  The younger set appreciated the swimming passes.  Everyone enjoyed their stay in Sunriver!

Found the house a little run down and truly cared for.  Will not rent again.

Overall a cery positive rental, two negatives, though: too dark and not air conditioned.

We had a wonderful time. The home was very cozy and was stocked well for a large group of children and adults.

This was the perfect place for our family of 10, including a few young children.  The deck is a great spot to sit and visit in the shade during the warm afternoons.  Loved having two coffee pots which we used daily.  Beds are soft....beware!  Lots of towels for the showers.  It would be wonderful for the next guests  if everyone would be nice enough  to burn off the grease they produce while barbecuing.  The maintenance crew for this house are right there if you need them for anything.

This is a GREAT place and  our family plans to return.

We recently filled every bed in this house with a large family gathering!  Bedrooms on main level are spacious and nice.  A couple of the upstairs rooms didn't have window coverings and had a lot of early morning light. Main areas are comfortable although could have a bit more seating .  Difficult to have everyone sit at main dining table but could split part of the group outside.  Kitchen was well stocked and large, making meal times enjoyable. Location of house is excellent.  Very close to main village.  Bike paths in backyard.  Large, open backyard great for kids and dogs.  The back deck/patio area was wonderful for adults to sit and enjoy beautiful weather. Overall it was a great house with only minor issues.

3 PInecone was a perfect house for our large group.  We were pleased with the house - the photos are a good representation of actual.  The open space behind the house was great for horseshoes and other yard games.  The hot tub was clean and ready to use.  Overall, we had a great time and didn't long for any other amenities as this house had it all.  will definitely recommend to large families and groups.

The house was amazing.  It was fully stocked - which has not been our experience with other homes we have rented.  We had a wonderful time and would rent this home again.

Great set-up for two families.  Perfect loft and rooms upstairs for teens.   Kitchen was very well stocked.  Loved the pantry and fireplace and hot tub.  The beds were very comfortable and the whole house has a great feel.  The only suggestion for improvement would be to add additional lighting  to the master bedroom with the walk-in closet.  A bright floor lamp in the corner would be great!

Excellent property for a lot of people that enjoy sleeping in their own good bed.  Well stocked kitchen and bathrooms.  Really impressed with how clean everything was.  SHARK passes a wonderful thing.

We had a group of 9 for a conference at the Great Hall and the house was within walking distance of this.  The house was in good condition with everything you would need on a visit.  The house is a little dark as most houses are in wooded areas, but very nice.  It would have been nice to have a larger variety of cable on the TV as we just received basic local channels.  Also, was a little challenging with 9 people and two bathrooms, but nothing major.

Overall, and very nice place to stay with no problems.

Our family has been renting vacation homes every Spring for 12 years.  This was the best experience we've ever had.  This was the first time that there were actually enough rolls of toilet paper, paper towels, and enough garbage bags provided to get us through the six days.  The kitchen was exceptionally well stocked with everything needed for a large family meal and the two refers were a godsend.  I could go on, but suffice to say we will be staying again and will recommend wholeheartedly.  Thank you.

We stayed at 3 Pinecone during Spring Break. We absolutely loved the fireplace and had lots of fires in it! The house is fantastic, the kids had a blast upstairs! Fully enjoyed the hot tub and the jet bath! As a mom, I really appreciated the washroom, would love that size in my house :-)

The horse shoe game in the back was a big hit with the family too! The 5 year old could safely bike around the circle in front. This house is fantastic for a family to stay at. We will certainly stay here again.

My family gathered here to celebrate our Christmas together early.  The home was just what we wanted.  It was a lovely home with lots of room and all the little extras to make our stay great.  We loved it and would highly recommend it!!!! We will definately be back.

We loved this house. Had some minor issues with the hot tub, but maintenance was really responsive. Great for large groups. Can't wait to visit again.

We have vacationed in a lot of different places in Sunriver. So far this is our favorite. We would have used the bikes that came with the rental but we didn't have a key to the garage.But we founds lots to do and had a great time. We are thinking about renting it again next year.

we were very happy with this property. It's was a good location, clean, kitchen well stocked and all at a good price.

If you're looking for a cozy Sunriver retreat in a great location, 13 Juniper is the vacation home for you.

This fun house is close to all the action in town. Bring your own bicycles - or rent some - and within minutes you can pedal along a bike path to The Village for dining and shopping - or even ice skating in winter. You can even bring along your pets, though please note that a $10 nightly, per-pet fee (with a $40 minimum per stay) will apply.

You're also a stone's throw from SHARC, the amazing new aquatic center. You get eight free unlimited passes to SHARC's pools, play areas, year-round tubing hill and so much more!

The home is decorated with country touches and offers your family a comfortable place to relax and enjoy. The living room features a vaulted ceiling and a nice wood-burning fireplace where everyone can gather. As as you sit around the fire, you can even hear the quiet rumble of the train like it used to in the early days in Central Oregon.

The convenient kitchen is downstairs, too, and so is the dining area. Step out onto the deck to enjoy the mountain air, have a barbecue or soak in the hot tub.

You'll find a bedroom with a bath in the hall on the ground floor, so guests with limited mobility don't have to maneuver stairs. On the second floor, there are two bedrooms: One has a queen, and the other features a queen and a bunk bed with a double below and a twin above. There's also an extra queen tucked under the eaves.

This cozy home is perfect for a family vacation on a budget. You get all the fun of Sunriver without breaking the bank!

**Please note, this home is by the active railroad tracks**

Pros:

This home has a wonderful feel!

The layout is nice with tons of sleeping space!

A large living room, plenty of space to take in a movie.

It was really cool to sit in the hot tub at night and have the train go by! (the train is about 30 feet away!)

We really were not bothered by the train, rather we thought it pretty cool, also it did go by at night but we were not woken :)

The warm tub (104 max ) was large and clean.

I loved having use of the washer and dryer, there was even saop!

The kitchen was fully stocked for cooking wear.

All of the wood that you want to burn is there for you already chopped.

Cons:

Bring your own Batteries, there were only enough for one remote.

If you want to use the fireplace you will need a lighter, as the one there is long d.e.a.d. And for some reason when we used the fireplace everynow and then smoke would fill the room.... We checked the visitor book and there was nothing in it about using the fire place.... I am sure this was user error?!

The beds are really hard! All of them!

All in all this home was the perfect spot for the girls getaway! Close to the shops and the  SHARC and Bend! Yet with the rail road right there it gives Tons of privacy! We will be going there again!

I made a reservation for Sunriver with another company and didn't realize I booked the wrong weekend until the morning we were supposed to leave. So I frantically Google somewhere else to stay and stumbled upon Vacasa. I called them up and there were very helpful to get me exactly what we needed, for the same day! The two ladies I talked to were so helpful! I will definitely be choosing vacasa the next time I travel to Sunriver.

With regards to the rental we stayed at, 12 Juniper, it was great. Clean and cozy! We would definitely recommend it.

Thank you for the great weekend!

We enjoyed our stay here. The place was comfortable and clean. The little boys loved the bunk beds. The home is near a railroad track, and I actually chose it because of that. We have a train obsessed 2 year old and he thought that was the greatest thing seeing a real train go by. It was loud of course, but not bothersome. Only about 2-3 went by per day while we were there. The hot tub wasn't super hot and the temperature was set to 104, I don't think it got that hot. We would def stay here again, but I do hope that the hot tub would be hot! Overall a wonderful place with a lot to do around the area!

We loved our stay at this property! We had a gaggle of folks with us, and though not a huge house, the separation of space worked perfectly and we we're very comfortable. This wE our second Vacasa experience and I really appreciate Vacasa and their responsive staff.

Stayed here over 4 th of July weekend. Overall not too bad. Bring your own bed linens as theirs are old and don't stay on the bed. Bathrooms weren't very clean.  They need to give this place some TLC. Had a very musty smell. We did enjoy the hot tub. But not so much the trains that go by. Scared us to death the first nite. Sounded like s plane was crash landing in the bedrooms. Lol. Overall not bad. Will stay again.

I was highly disappointed in the rental because I was not informed before I rented the property that the BNSF railroad has tracks less than 35 yards away from the back of the building.  We were awakened each morning at approx. 1: 00 am and 7:00 am each day. With the tracks being located so close to the home the entire house would shake when the train passed by. The train consists are very long just so you know!

I also wanted to let you know that I kept hearing strange noises outside my downstairs bedroom wall. I kept hearing what sounded like knocking on the walls and scratching and thumping noises. I would get up and look outside and see nothing. I walked around the house on and I noticed a big hole in the outside exterior wall where it appears birds have made a â€œbird houseâ€ out of the home. You can see the hole as you face the home. It is located on the right upper portion of the wall. This was the source of the noises I kept hearing. Having to hear this also kept me from getting sleep. The inside walls are probably a mess from the birds. Prepare to hear the noises from the creatures during your stay

I have written twice to Vacasa to lodge my complaints however they have not tried to contact me! Maybe they will now, who knows!

Needless to say, the above problems ruined our weekend  in Sunriver!

Overall, the home could be maintained a bit better.   Hot tub was actually a warm tub, never could get the wifi to properly work and could not get the cable to work downstairs.  Dishwasher did not work well.  Additionally, the train runs very close to the house and is very loud.  This would not be that big of a deal except it ran 4 times each night.

This is a great affordable place to stay! :)

We had a great time exploring Sunriver and all it has to offer (hint: it's a lot!).

The rental process was easy and smooth, the email communication was clear and timely, and the checkout was simple and easy.

The house is plenty big enough for a family of 4-6.

We had a lot of fun and ate planning to return next summer!

Love the location, love the price. Train tracks were great, our kids loved putting pennies on it and Hunting them after the train went by, they had so much fun doing that! The sound of the train is comforting to me, it wasn't super loud. If I had one little negative  thing to say about the home, is the bathrooms are very small, but that was not a big issue, they were very clean. I would most definitely stay here again!

WE enjoyed our stay very much.  There were 7 of us. 5 Adults and 2 children.  The property was clean and comfortable.  Beds were a little uncomfortable for us but they were clean and in good condition.  There were plenty of towel, linens etc.  We could have used a few more glasses and cups.  Hot tub was clean and great.  The opening in the deck around the hot tub is open and a little dangerous.  Have to watch your step Especially in the dark.  Overall we had a great time and the house was great.  We would recommend staying here to anyone.  We are planning to come back next year.  We  will probably be staying in a little larger house as we may have more people join us.  We have not decided yet.  We stay here again if our numbers allow it.  Thank you very much for making our vacation very wonderful.  We have used Vacasa twice now and everything has gone without a hitch.  Thank you.

Cozy home with fireplace and hot tub.  Great neighborhood near SHARC center.

Bonus: Home came with SHARC passes!

This is not the biggest, best, most well appointed house in SunRiver.  But it is an inexpensive, clean, cozy little place on a quiet cul-de-sac that we would come back to without hesitation.  We loved being near the train tracks as it allowed us a much higher level of privacy and made our back yard much more fun.  Vacasa people were friendly and easy to work with.  From this experience we can't help recommend both Vacasa and 13 Juniper, they will be our first choice on our next SunRiver excursion.

This was our 2nd year staying in 13 Juniper...really enjoyed it. Peaceful and cozy. Sunriver is a vacation we will take every year and 13 Juniper was perfect for our family.

We spent five nights at 13 Juniper in June 2013. We really enjoyed the property, the amenities were great, the SHARC passes were awesome. It would be nice if there had been a couple of bikes, but we did bring two so the teenagers (and hubby) got in plenty of riding time. The weather was lovely and we really enjoyed our time. Sunriver's on our must-visit list for next summer!

Friends and I stayed here for the beginning of our spring break and we loved it. It's not super close to Bend, but close enough where we could drive in for the day. The house was cute and fun. The kitchen was small and kinda awkward, but other then that it was a great trip!

Nice little house, but understand that it is only 75 feet from the train line, and four trains a night go right past the house.  If you like trains, then you will love this place.  If you have young children I recommend staying someplace else.

We booked this last minute, and Vacasa was great in assisting us to do so.  This is an affordable place that has enough room for everyone to sleep and enjoy themselves. We like that it is on a quiet circle, so our kids could ride around the circle without worrying about too much traffic. The train seemed to come late at night or in the morning, so we didn't worry too much about it.  The hot tub  was clean and ready to use.  The Sharc passes are wonderful to have--you only need them for kids ages 4 and up.  This is conveniently located to all the kid's activities!

Great space for your money and the hot tub was nice. Came with 8 SHARC passes and we loved the new pool. It's also super close to SHARC as well. Nice location in the middle of Sun River. Kitchen is small but functional and house could use some updating but great layout for kids and great value for what you pay for and the number of bedrooms and beds. Can easily accommodate 2 families. Backyard with picnic bench, BBQ, and hot tub was also nice.

Hot tub was nice and peaceful sitting out back. Train scared me a bit the first night but kids didn't even notice. It really wasn't that big of a deal unless you are super picky. Can't beat the price and feel it was adequate for what we got.

Our family of 4 stayed at 13 Juniper for a week. The property is in good condition, and Vacasa was professional and responsive to our needs. The house is VERY close to the train tracks, which was cause for concern with our young children, but with proper supervision they enjoyed watching and hearing the trains go by (about twice a day). The location is good, and a quick bike to the park, village and SHARC. The only negative to this property is that you must bring your own bikes, and there isn't a secure storage area for bikes and bike gear. It would have been lovely to have lounge chairs out back to stargaze, but the picnic bench and hot tub were quite enjoyable. We all loved our Sunriver vacation!

This is the best value we've found in Sunriver! Our family had a wonderful time enjoying all Sunriver had to offer. It was so nice having enough SHARC passes for all of us. We biked, played sand volleyball, played tennis, swam and enjoyed some great family time. Great location, great accommodations, and great price. We do hope to come back ... soon!

This was a great place to stay. It felt like you had more room and privacy. The house was well maintanied and you didn't feel like you had to clean when you first arrived. This was almost perfect with evrything you needed except bikes. Our family would do it again

Only complaint that we had, was that there were no bikes available on site. That was my fault because I assumed that most homes had bikes. Other than that, was very nice.

Close to SHARC and Fort Rock Park.  House is in good condition and kitchen is well-equipped.  Good for kids.

The house was perfect for our family of four. We were on the go all day but had a nice place to relax, watch movies, and play cards at night.  A large park, tennis courts, SHARC, and the village are all within walking distance or a very easy bike ride. Great location!

We had a great stay at 17 Diamond Peak Lane. It was our first trip to Sunriver and the location was perfect! The house was clean and the beds were comfy. We were a little disappointed in the floorplan and the outdated kitchen but we would stay again...so it couldn't have been that bad!

We stayed at 17 Diamond Peak with another family for a weekend while our daughter had a softball tournament in Bend. Sharing this home cost less than each family staying in a hotel room, and Sunriver is so much better!! The online booking process was quick and easy, and I received a confirmation phone call from a very friendly Vacasa worker. Our stay was wonderful too - just not long enough. We only rent homes with SHARC passes included, and this was a great house for us. Both couples had our own room and the kids shared the loft. It is a cute house in a great, quiet location. The only thing we needed that we couldn't find was some pot holders to take the lasagna out of the oven, but there were plenty of hand towels, so we made do. Everything else we needed was available. We would recommend this home to others and we hope to stay again!

Everything was clean, hot tub was great. Nice place to stay. Good value. Especially liked the fireplace and wood supply.

Everything about our stay was just what we were hoping for.  Booking was so simple on line and the check in instructions were clear and concise.  The property itself was easy to find, private and close to features important to us- the pathways, The Village and SHARC (although we did not go there).  When we arrived the home was exceptionally clean and tidy, with pleasant decorative touches.  It was so nice to walk in and feel immediately comfortable and at home.  We are looking forward to booking this property in the future.

The house was cozy and the location was great! It is walking distance to SHARC, but with little kids we ended up driving. Great biking area for kids and paths that seem to go on and on if you like to walk :-)

Myself and a couple girlfriends from the area spent 2 nights here this past weekend. We had a wonderful time! It was the perfect cozy house for 3-5 people. Cute decor and equipped with everything we needed for a nice, relaxing weekend. The massive TV was a nice surprise for watching some movies. The hot tub was clean and worked well and made a nice addition to the trip! The king bed was the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on!  Making the reservation, check-in, and check out was so easy thanks to Vacasa. We found this site through VRBO and this is by far the best and easiest experience I've had. I'll definitely use the site again as well as will remember this house so we can come back again next year! Thanks again, guys!

This is one of the nicest vacation condos I have stayed at, especially with a very well stocked kitchen (including some staples/seasonings) and wood and kindling for the fireplace. Having the hot tub was super nice extra and we used it just about every day. All the beds were very comfortable and lots of extra bedding and towels. The space is great for one family (2 bdrms and the loft space had 2 beds). Probably not big enough for multiple families.

We would come back for sure!

This was a quick trip but we really enjoyed our stay.  The hot tub was nice, the beds were so comfortable and although the house is not terribly spacious, it was the perfect size for our group.  Great for one family.

Great property, just the right size for our family of 5.  Close to SHARC which was nice for the kids. All the amenities of home. The number of remote controls required to operate the TV was a bit intimidating at first, but we managed :) Overall, great place to stay.

We love all of what Sunriver has to offer. As much as you want to fill your day or simply kick back and relax and enjoy your surroundings. The summer brings the float down the Deschutes River, swimming, and golf. The winter brings skiing, warm fires, and of course a nice soak in the hot tub.

This house is located close to the Sharc Center and the Village. Great for a nice walk. We had 8 passes to the Sharc Center which was AWESOME! The house was clean and had all the essentials. The "boys" were super impressed with the fancy TV (it was college football bowl season- bonus!). There were 4 adults and two children. It was comfortable, but the upstairs being loft might pose an issue had there been an additional couple- not a lot of privacy. The house was nicely stocked with lots of blankets, pillows, towels, cleaning supplies, garbage bags, and utensils. Also- there was tons of wood for the fireplace- nice touch! The hot tub was well maintained. Overall, I don't think you can beat the location and amenities for the price! Great deal, great house! Vacasa is friendly and easy to work with.

Loved this home! Perfect for our family! Great location...especially loved the private hot tub and wood burning fireplace. We will definitely be back! Have never rented from Vacasa before...very impressed! Thank you for a wonderful vacation experience!!

We had a fantastic time.  Property was better than anticipated and was very conveniently located.  We would highly recommend to anyone interested in visiting Sunriver and we would definitely stay here again.  I had not previously used Vacasa but  would also definitely book through them again.

Thank you for having an affordable home on your site.  This place was lovely. The beds are very comfortable with very nice sheets.  The location is easy to all activities without getting lost.  The coupon for All Season's Bike rental was a nice bonus.  We explored all of Sunriver with the bikes.  Thank you for the SHARC passes.  We really enjoyed the Lazy River exercise class. We look forward to staying at 17 Diamond Peak many times in the future.

While the property is not super high-end, it had nice furnishings, comfortable beds and a great living room area with a really nice flat screen TV.  Having the SHARC passes included was a definite bonus.  It fit two families with 4 adults and 3 young kids pretty easily.  We would stay here again.

Great and very comfortable home. With so many places to choose from - quit looking and book this place!

This house was absolutely perfect! Very clean, great location, amazing hot tub, comfortable bed, relaxing lighting, well stocked kitchen, private outdoor space, and to top it all off, the atmosphere and charm of the house are absolutely perfect for Sunriver.  I felt relaxed and officially on vacation the minute we opened the front door. Check in and out couldn't be any easier.  We're already looking for another weekend to go back.

Kitchen was great!  Plenty of silverware, cooking utensils, etc. Slept great in the master.  Had two adults upstairs which worked fine, though the staircase is pretty tight.  Overall a great stay!  Thank you!

This home is very nice, clean, and perfect for our family get away it so close to the village we were within walking distance to everything.

We enjoyed a wonderful weekend staying here along with exceptional service from the Vacasa staff,  we will definitely stay again next year.

One of the most perfect cabins in sunriver.

A simple, but pleasant house where we stayed two mid-week nights in October. Antelope street is about 100 feet from a busy road; not the best for real countrified quiet. I liked the Ponderosa pine forest surrounding, simple and unadorned with city trappings like lawns. I saw deer one morning, and coyotes yipped at night

What a great house.  Full of character and nicely styled.  The location is primo, easy walking distance to the SHARC center, and even easier to the Village.  The private sun deck with hot tube was nice for a relaxing soak during the cool mornings.  The only thing this house needs is a set of blinds in the down stairs bedroom.   Other than that, I would certainly stay here again.

The house was beautiful. Had a nice layout and was well maintained. Very happy overall with our stay.

We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  The only drawback for us is that it is very close to the main road but there are also advantages to that as well.  Really though this place was perfect for our party of 2.

We were pleasantly pleased with the location, condition and cleanliness of this property. Very cozy. Checking in and out was very simple. We will stay here again.

This modern Sunriver vacation home is packed with amenities, from a well-stocked game room to complimentary bicycles to a private hot tub on the back deck. There is plenty of space for up to ten guests, and your group will love the special touches in this home like custom-built accents, exposed timber beams, and grand vaulted ceilings.

Tucked away in a wonderful location near Fort Rock Park, you're a short drive (or bike ride) to SHARC, Sunriver's best aquatic center -- and ten free passes are included with your stay!

The home at 17 Camas Lane has two stories of living space, with four bedrooms, three full baths and one half baths! The living area has soaring ceilings and plenty of windows to let in the famous Central Oregon sunshine. The kitchen is nicely stocked, and there's room for eight people at the dining table for special meals or hearty breakfasts before a day of exploration.

Younger guests (and the young-at-heart) will especially enjoy the game room, decked out with air hockey, foosball, Ping-Pong, and plenty of board games for rainy days. There's also a cable TV with DVD/Blu-Ray for movie nights, and wireless Internet for those who need to keep up with email -- or search for that perfect hike in the nearby national forest!

In the evening, four bedrooms include three queen beds and four twins, making it very comfortable for up to ten guests to share the space. With a house this size, it's easy to spread out and enjoy plenty of elbow room; in fact, feel free to bring along sleeping bags for the youngest guests and invite a few more friends -- guests under five years old don't count towards the maximum occupancy in Sunriver!

The home is pet-friendly, but there is maximum of two dogs over a year old that are very reliably trained, and a $10 nightly fee per pet will apply (with a $40 minimum fee required).

The home has a spacious deck, nicely furnished and offering a private hot tub for leisurely evenings and a gas grill for afternoon barbecues. Grab one of the bikes from the garage and explore Sunriver's miles of paved paths, or head to the Village for a little window-shopping or a frosty pint at Sunriver Brewing Company.

Of course, the area is close to skiing and snowboarding at Mt. Bachelor in the winter, with the Deschutes River nearby for kayaking and rafting during the warmer months. The resort has swimming pools galore, tennis courts, parks, horse stables, and world-class golf courses to choose from.

However you choose to spend your Sunriver days, you'll adore calling this modern beauty your home-away-from-home during your stay!

This was a great house to take a family.  The upstairs playroom with its own sink and refrig was perfect!  The house also supplies fans and has ceiling fans which was great.  Keeping the upstairs bedroom doors closed during the day and the blinds shut, helped keep the rooms cooler at night.  The bike selection was awesome!  Hottub was very well kept.  Overall, great!!

17 Camas is spacious and well located to access the north entrance to Sunriver.   It is on a quiet  cul-de-sac.   A store is convenient about a mile away.  The kitchen is well equipped and the house is too.  Bikes and the game room are a real plus for all.  Not an inexpensive vacation week.

Our rental experience with Vacasa was the best we've ever had & we've rented many homes for family gatherings.  Everything was done by email, key at the house, instructions amazingly clear.  We will definitely use Vacasa again!!

The house itself was great with nice decor and adequate furnishings.  It had lots of entertainment for the kids (foosball, airhockey, ping pong table, board games, toys).  However, the whole house was filthy dirty (had not been vacuumed or mopped) with animal hair/human hair on bed linen, blankets, pillows.  The carpet needs deep cleaning.  The bottoms of our feet were black after walking around the house bare-footed.  Management did not do a satisfactory job in tending to our needs and complaints promptly.

This was a perfect rental for a couple of families looking for an easy, convenient, vacation.  The location was ideal for Fort Rock Park and the house had all of the amenities we needed to entertain the kids and cook at home.  We will definitely be back!

We were very pleased with this house. Lots of space, beautiful great room with spacious, well stocked kitchen, and large table for meals, games. It's in a perfect central location, close to Fort Rock park. It worked really well for our family get together.

Frequent travelers expect to find something missing. Here, absolutely nothing was missing, and every age from baby to 84 was delighted to find more. A closet full of toys and puzzles, a pack and play for sleeping, ping-pong and foosball (and table hockey too), enough furniture in the living room for everyone to interact together, a super-comfortable easy chair in both the living room and master bedroom, dressers in every bedroom, plenty of bathrooms,  a kitchen better equipped than any rental I've every seen, delightful decor with "knickknacks" that completed the at-home-in-the-woods feeling, pretty art, a spacious garage with a few helpful items (too many groceries? Use the cooler in the garage OR the second refrigerator in the playroom.) Too many football fans? Assign 3 of them their own big screen TV's. Want to listen to your favorite CD's? Bring them and enjoy the wonderful sound system. We all--baby to Great Grandpa, toddler to grandparents, had an amazing vacation to remember in a home filled with love and amenities by its thoughtful owners.

We were incredibly pleased with every aspect of our Vacasa/Camas 17 vacation.  The house was immaculate and well equipped.  The closet was filled with so many amazing toys for our grandchildren.  We felt so comfortable and well cared for.  As a family we have decided to book this house every year if it is available.  We will also refer to Vacasa in the future because of they are customer friendly. Thank you for our wonderful family time!

17 Camas is a delightful place for a family vacation.  We had 3 generations here and the downstairs suite proved ideal for grandparents.  Parents and kids all enjoyed the upstairs with the recreation room.  Our World Cup Soccer fans cheered their hearts out for the USA and saw every move on the large screen TV up there.  Great!!

The home is so cozy and clean. Love the location and the privacy it offers.  And so appreciate that it's pet friendly.   As far as amenities, this place had a better equipped kitchen than any other place we've ever rented.  Even had a  Cuisinart and salad spinner!   The only thing I would like to see different is the mattress in the master bedroom.  It was very  firm and not so great for older bones.  But that is so minor in comparison to the plusses.

Very happy with vacation Rental.   House was very clean and well appointed

We had a great 2 nights in Sunriver.  The sun was out but it was a little cold at night.  The hot tub was great and we had a fun time in the rec room playing ping pong and putting puzzles together.  Cant wait to come back.

We had such a great time as a family with son and his wife and daughter, son Inlaw and granddaughter.  The house is so well equipped with everything you could need.  The weather was very wet and windy so we were unable to do a lot of outdoor activities, but house was so comfortable to just hang out and play games or just relax.  We will definitely try to go next year and reserve Camas 17 again.

This is a fabulous place to stay!  The rooms are large and there is plenty of space for everyone.  The kitchen is well stocked, and the decor is unique and comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay very much.

We had the pleasure of staying at 17 Camas for 5 days in July. There were 8 family members and plenty of space for everyone.  The game room and large screen television were a big hit with the younger members!  We all appreciated the Sharc passes.  It is a lovely home, well maintained and stocked. Highly recommend it!

This wonderfully decorated three-bedroom Sunriver vacation home is just waiting for your family vacation, holiday getaway, or quiet high desert retreat! Just about 15 miles south of Bend, Oregon, Sunriver is a family-friendly destination resort boasting over 35 miles of paved biking trails, a state-of-the-art Aquatic & Recreation Center (SHARC), a spa, holiday sleigh rides, ice skating, and four world class golf courses.

When you step inside, you'll be greeted by an abundance of natural light streaming in from the many windows, as well as a pleasant Americana/Folk Art decorating scheme. The large open space downstairs is light and airy, with comfortable furnishings that will make everyone in your group feel right at home. In the living room and dining area, you'll find beautifully framed Sunriver Music Festival Posters hung up high on the walls, taking advantage of the tall ceilings.

After a day skiing at Mt. Bachelor or biking around the resort, come back to your Sunriver home for a night of movies, everyone gathered around the TV on the cozy living room sofas. In addition to a DVD player and cable, there's also a VCR in case you want to bring old school video tapes from home. A large coffee table can hold snacks, drinks, and even board games or a puzzle.

An open kitchen and dining area feature a lovely wood-burning, river rock fireplace for cozy meal preparation and dinner feasts. The galley-style kitchen has a range/oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave - all you'll need for preparing everything from bowls of granola and fruit in the morning to a French-themed meal with coq au vin at night. There's even a coffee grinder for freshly ground beans in the morning.

Right off the dining table, sliding glass doors lead out to a patio for cookouts on the gas grill, sitting out in the afternoon sun, or even an after-dinner glass of port, everyone all bundled up against the chilly evening. In summer, you can sit outside and listen to the birds and in winter, the patio can still be enjoyed with mugs of hot cocoa and warm mittens.

On the main level, you'll find two bedrooms - one with a queen bed and one with two twins. Both have lovely quilts, comfortable beds, and nice accessories like reading lamps, bedside tables, and wooden dressers. Between the bedrooms is a downstairs laundry room, for keeping clothes clean and dry after days out exploring the area. A full bathroom with a shower/tub condo is also located on this floor.

The master suite is located upstairs in the loft. With tall, vaulted ceilings, this luxurious area has a TV, a small sitting area, and a private bath with shower (no tub). It's a beautiful retreat for relaxing at the end of a fun Sunriver day! This home will comfortably sleep six guests - if extra space is needed, consider also booking nearby #30 Circle Four Cabin for an additional eight guests.

At only a mile away, SHARC is close by for swimming in both indoor and outdoor pools, a lazy river, outdoor hot tub, and even water slides. And when you stay at this home, six SHARC passes are included with your stay. Also an easy bike ride away, is the Village at Sunriver for dining and shopping, the stables for horseback riding, tennis courts, and one of three golf courses - Crosswater, Meadows, The Woodlands, and Caldera Links. There's even the Sage Springs Spa for a day filled with well-deserved pampering.

The resort also has a number of recreation partners, providing family-friendly excursions like whitewater rafting, mountain bike tours featuring a downhill trail past waterfalls, rock climbing at Smith Rock State Park, and fly fishing in one of the area's many rivers and streams.

Just outside the resort, Mt. Bachelor beckons in winter for downhill skiing and snowboarding, plus you'll find ample opportunities throughout the Deschutes National Forest for snowshoeing, as well as cross-country skiing. On your way back to Sunriver, stop in Bend for dinner at one of the many restaurants - shrimp and jambalaya at Zydeco Kitchen, middle eastern delicacies at Joolz, or burgers and pints of Bachelor Bitter at the Deschutes Brewery Public House.

With its abundance of amenities, nearby attractions, and things to do, this comfortable Sunriver vacation rental will make your time in the Oregon high desert both relaxing and memorable!

Great for young families with small children! Teenagers would love it too!

The place was so clean! I really appreciate that !

Lovely place.  SHARC passes were very much appreciated.  The bedrooms were nice and big.  The living room felt a bit small for 6 people.  However, the outside porch was very good.   We will rent again, and highly recommend our friends and family to rent this cabin.   Wish to thank the owner for sharing their cabin with us.  The option to late checkout by VACASA was priceless.  We could utilize our Sunday because of this option.

This cabin is ideal for a family retreat.  Plenty of space in the open air design with nice furnishings and central location within Sunriver Resort.  8 pool passes come with the rental and the number of activities exceeded our stay.  Easy drive to Bend, High Desert Museum, Lava Lands and a day trip from Crater Lake.  We will be back!

The house is great, very clean and nice.  It was very cold in April so fireplace helped a lot to feel cozy :-)

This is a nice cozy home.  Very clean and inviting.  The house has a wrap around portch which cuts quite a bit of the natural light from coming in, so is a bit darker than it could be.  Furnishing are quite comfortable with nice decor and nice kitchen.  One lacking item is bicycles.  If you plan on biking a lot and have several people in your family you need to spend $20-$25 per day to rent bikes, so plan that into your expenditures or get a house that offers bikes.  We really enjoyed our stay at #29 Circle Four Cabin.  We would rent this property again.

This cozy two bedroom vacation rental home in beautiful Sunriver has been newly remodeled and is just waiting for your family or friends.   This attractive and spacious home is located close to all the Sunriver South amenities.   Your stay also comes with 6 SHARC passes.

The single level vacation rentalhome has been totally remodeled and is furnished with new furniture.  You enter into the the great room which shares the living room (sofa bed) with a large flat screen TV, a dining area with a nice large table and six chairs, and the kitchen with new appliances.   However, the charm of the cabin remains.

There is a bedroom with a queen bed and a bunk bed with its own access to the hall bathroom.  The second bedroom has a king bed and its own bathroom with a walk in shower.

And, of course, this lovely vacation rental getaway has a big deck with hot tub and gas barbecue.

Please note that this vacation rental home is located adjacent to the train tracks.   The trains will run 3-4 times during the day and night.  You will hear a rumbling sound, but there will be no whistles.  Most guests do not find the trains to be an issue and enjoy their charm.

Great home for family with nice amenities.  It is close to the train tracks but ear plugs fix that.  Nice location to SHARC and very nice, quiet street.

My review will echo many of the existing reviews. I was really impressed with the organization of the process and the resources offered. The train is not only loud (no horn though), it shakes the ground epically. The Train only goes by once or twice a day, but it's really unfortunate when it happens at 3am when you're profoundly asleep. Thankfully it only lasts 30 seconds or so.

The advertised WiFi did not work. It showed it was available, but the password that was provided was incorrect. A call to customer support and the property manager yielded no help. I was referred to the ISP who could not have helped with a network password. I am an IT Manager so I rigged my laptop to broadcast my own WiFi from the connection. This worked fine but I did a lot of work I would rather not have done on my vacation. Other than those two points the house and service were exceptional and I would definitely consider this property in my next Sunriver plans!

What a wonderful cozy home! Our family of six fit just right in. Very pleased with everything about the house and it's condition. I only scored the property location three-star because of the railroad tracks. My husband had a hard time sleeping thru it, but it didn't bother me or the kiddos at all! Location itself in Sunriver is great, close to SHARC, big rock park and the village. Thank you!

This was a lovely home that has been updated and has VERY comfortable beds. The hot tub was great, outdoor BBQ very nice, and the SHARC passes invaluable! The only drawback to this home (which is mentioned) is it's proximity to the train tracks. They literally run right next to the home...the train doesn't seem to run often but when it does, you feel it! My kids did LOVE watching it go by tho! Thanks for sharing your home!

Be advised...the tracks are right next to and elevated above the home and it seemed that most trains ran from midnight to 6 am.  About 2-3 times per night. No whistles, but they are very loud even with the windows closed.  Keeps you from leaving the windows open at night.  They pass rather quickly, but irritating to be awakened.  This is advised in the  rental description, but I think needs to be emphasized more.  Would make us look for a different house next time.  Other than that........very comfortable.

It was one of the funniest times in sunriver.

Great home & setting for our family of 6 - all kids in the bedroom with bunk beds & queen bed, the master was very nice.  Liked the open kitchen combined with dining & living room so we could all be together yet have space to do our own thing - watch TV & do puzzles on the table.

This charming and newly remodeled two bedroom Sunriver vacation home makes an excellent home base for exploring all that this popular, family-friendly resort has to offer. You'll be just steps away from restaurants, shopping, tennis courts, and trails - even the Sunriver Conference Center is within walking distance.

A plush brown sectional sofa is the perfect place to relax after a day of biking, hiking, or swimming at the Sunriver Homeowners Aquatic and Recreation Center (SHARC). Gather everyone around for a platter of snacks on the leather ottoman/coffee table and pop in a movie - there's a flat screen TV with cable as well as a DVD player here, a Wii game console plus games and a library of movies for you to enjoy.

The kitchen and dining room share this open space so it's easy to carry on conversations whether you're at the dining room table using the WiFi to check email, watching TV in the living room, or chopping up some vegetables in the kitchen. When you do want to prepare a meal, you'll have a stainless steel refrigerator, stove-top/oven, and dishwasher at your disposal. And on nights you don't feel like cooking, there are six restaurants right at the resort to choose from and even more options when you include the nearby towns of Bend and Sisters.

Outside on the deck, you'll have access to a gas grill for cooking up some burgers or chicken, and patio furniture if you want to stay outside and make your meal an outdoor occasion. This outdoor space is also a nice way to pass the time on a lazy sunny afternoon - just grab a book and catch up on your reading while you sip a glass of wine.

When it's time to turn in, one bedroom is a nicely-decorated with a queen sized bed, TV cabinet, and new wood furniture. You'll want to sleep in late here! For the kids, the other bedroom has twin-over-full bunk beds, as well as a trundle. They'll be room for up to six guests as this comfortably, well-laid out home!

There's one full bathroom, as well as a stackable washer and dryer in the bright laundry room - there's even a counter for folding clothes. This home also includes a CD player for listening to your favorite music, and a Wii console with games for the rare rainy day. When the sun shines, you'll find thoughtful outdoor amenities included in the home, like tennis rackets and tennis balls, sleds, and an outdoor croquet game. There's so much to do before you even consider leaving the house!

But once you do, at Sunriver Resort you'll have 35 miles of paved biking and hiking trails. The Benham Falls Loop is a short eight mile loop around the Deschutes River, or if you're feeling up to it, pedal around Sparks and Lava Lakes - an exhaustive 10 mile trail that will reward you with stunning mountain views. Golfers can choose between the Crosswater, Meadows, and Woodlands Courses, as well as the family-friendly, nine-hole Caldera Links.

In winter, borrow the sled and speed down some hills, or just make your way to SHARC for some indoor swimming. Mt. Bachelor is only a 30 minute drive away, and right from the Sunriver Lodge, you can pick up a shuttle that will take you right there (and bring you back) for $20. Year-round, use your SHARC passes to enjoy the heated indoor pool, outdoor pools, hot tubs, lazy river, tubing hill, and more.

This Sunriver vacation rental is perfect for the whole family! Plan a getaway to the Oregon high desert for fun in the sun with hiking and golfing, or a ski retreat to remember - Sunriver Resort offers it all!

This condo was perfect. Very nicely decorated, super clean, ideal winter location, and overall the perfect place for a weekend getaway. The owners have done an amazing job making their place welcoming and home-like. We will definitely be back!

The Abbot Condo allowed us to just sit back, relax and unwind. It was easy to get to the Sharc water park. We could bike to it, or even take a short walk. We had a problem with one of the bikes there. We had to rent a bike to replace it. Vacasa staff quickly solved it by offering to reimburse our bike rental. All in all, it was a great trip.

I would recommend this Condo to anyone.  It was clean, neat, had so many extras like swimming passes, bikes to ride, even towells for swimming.  We loved our stay and are staying again at the same place in August.  Totally loved it.

We were very happy with the amenities in the condo such as nice towels, comfortable furniture and many board games.  The sleds came in handy too.

Loved the house, the staff were so friendly and easy to contact. They email and communicate a ton, will use vacasa again.

It was a great place to spend the week of the 4th. Fun actvities and a very convenient condo to stay in.

The location to the Village was exactly what we wanted this trip. While the space was a little small, it was comfortable and nicely furnished.  There were some minor maintenance issues that needed to be taken care of. But overall, this was a nice little condo.

The process of this was so simple.  It was so much better then a hotel room for the weekend for about the same cost. We will be planning to do this again with Vacasa.

You'll have easy access outdoors from the kitchen for grilling up a platter of steaks, rosemary-garlic marinated chicken thighs, or even portobello mushroom burgers. When it's time to eat, you can stay outside and enjoy dining al fresco at the outdoor table.

Back inside on this main level, there's a cozy bedroom with a queen-size bed, bedside tables, reading lamps, and a window seat looking out at a tree-lined view. As this is the only bedroom on this level, it's great for anyone who wants a bit more privacy.

If you head upstairs, you'll come to the other two bedrooms - one with a full bed and the other with two twin beds featuring bright, fun bedding sure to appeal to younger guests.

This home will comfortably sleep six guests and additional amenities in the condo include a washer and dryer, and a stereo with a CD player. If you have a group larger than six, we do have nearby condos that would be perfect additions to this location to accommodate more guests - just call for details!

If you're planning a ski trip, the condo is centrally located with easy access to the slopes of Mt. Bachelor, only a 20 minute drive away. Right in the resort, the Village at Sunriver offers a seasonal ice-skating rink, as well as year-round shops and restaurants. And during the holiday months, you can enjoy sleigh rides (November - February), as well as sledding and tubing while snow is on the ground.

Sunriver amenities are vast, including four golf courses - Crosswater, Meadows, The Woodlands, and Caldera Links. Your stay also includes six unlimited passes to SHARC, the state-of-the-art aquatic center with year-round spas, saunas, swimming pools, and tubing hill. The desirable Quelah condo community also includes its own shared hot tubs, so you're free to enjoy those as well; staying here is almost like staying in a resort within the resort!

At Sunriver, you'll also enjoy 35 miles of paved bike paths letting you explore the entire resort on two wheels. In addition, just outside of the resort, you'll find a number of popular rides including the Benham Falls Loop, Todd Lake, and the Swede Ridge Loop - all offering beautiful scenery for biking.

Had a wonderful time. Children and grandchildren joined us for 3 days. Plenty of room and clean and perfect lication

By far one of the best vacations we have had as a family. Cozy living area, comfortable beds and room for everyone to stretch out and have their own space. 5 of us really enjoyed this condo! Having free access to SHARC was a big plus! We will come here again!

We had a family get together for New Years and had a wonderful time! Location was very good and the condo was great for our family.

sun river is a wonderful family and just friends destination.  Quelah 25 was an excellent place to rent.  The kitchen was very well stocked, Sharc daily passes and the condos have their own tennis courts and a lovely swimming pool with large hot tub.  the unit was very clean, nice furnishings, and great location. We will come back for sure!

We really enjoyed our stay at 25 Quelah Condo.  It was perfect for the four of us.  Good location that was close to the SHARC.  Condo was clean and well taken care of.

We have rented in Quelah countless times and have always had wonderful experiences! This particular condo has been updated throughout, creating a cozy, yet modern feel. We would definitely rent this unit again. :)

You'll find an adventurous and scenic destination for a family getaway at this beautiful two bedroom Sunriver vacation rental. Filled with cabin-in-the-woods design elements like tall, slanted ceilings, colorful throw rugs, and a gorgeous wood burning fireplace, this resort getaway is just perfect for a winter escape or a summer retreat.

Inside the warm and cozy living room there's a plush sofa for relaxing, lovely mica-shaded lamps for ambiance, and a fireplace for keeping everything all toasty on chilly nights. Come back from a day of hiking on some of Sunriver's 35 miles of paved trails for snacks and board games around the coffee table. There's also a flat screen TV with cable and a DVD player for even more entertainment options.

When it's time to eat, you can set the table and gather the family around - there's even extra seating for kids at the breakfast bar. Let them have their own spot while the adults enjoy a leisurely dinner at the table.

In the kitchen, you'll have all that you need to assemble and create meals. There's even a dishwasher to help clean it all up. And if you need any culinary inspiration just look at the wall: Fish should swim 3 times - in water, in butter, and wine! Of course, there's a gas grill out on the deck, so a cookout with thick, juicy burgers is always an option too.

When you do head outside to the patio, you'll have a lovely view into the trees. In winter, bundle up and enjoy a snowstorm, while in the summer, you can bring your coffee outside and breathe in that fresh mountain air while using the WiFi to check your email.

At the end of the day, after dinner and a movie, there's a snuggly spot for everyone to retire. One large bedroom has a king sized bed and the other has a queen. Both bedrooms are filled with accessories and outdoor-themed knick-knacks for a homey, comfortable feel. And upstairs in the loft area, there's a great sleeping area for kids with three twin beds - two of them a bunk bed set. With two full baths as well, this home will comfortably sleep up to six guests, including one dog with a $10 per day fee ($40 minimum per stay).

At Sunriver, you'll never run out of activities and excursions! This resort community has over 3,000 acres of pristine, high desert land. Just 15 miles south of Bend, you'll be able to plan day trips into town for brewery hopping, gallery browsing, and shopping but still be away from it all at this fun-filled vacation community.

From the pools and spas at the SHARC Aquatic Center (this house comes with six SHARC passes) to the Sunriver Stables and Nature Center, everyone in the whole family will find activities to enjoy. And in winter, Sunriver is only a 30 minute drive from Mt. Bachelor for downhill skiing and snowboarding. And if you get wet and dirty while out exploring the area, no worries. Your Cedar Lane vacation home has its own washer and dryer!

In summer, the same resort trails used for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing are perfect for biking, hiking, or just taking the dog on a walk after dinner. This home is also by Fort Rock State Park - a large formation of breathtaking jagged rock walls reminiscent of the southwest's Monument Valley.  Pack a lunch and spend the day at Fort Rock hiking, taking photos, and looking for high desert wildlife.

This Central Oregon resort is an ideal vacation destination year-round, and this Sunriver vacation rental is right in the middle of it all! Pack the car with the kids and dog and head out for a high desert adventure you won't soon forget!

This house was just right for us (2 couples). The overall feeling was an easy familiarity. It just felt homey and comfortable. Would not hesitate to return to this home.

Such a cute, cozy place. The staff at vacasa were amazing. I had accidentally booked the place an extra night and they quickly made the correction for me, with no exta cost! Would absolutely recommend this place and vacasa to my friends and family. Can't wait to come back

My family and I loved staying at the house on Cedar Ln.! Our son loved the alcove upstairs with the bunk beds and our daughter loved having the downstairs bedroom and a bathroom all to herself. The kitchen, although a bit outdated, was fully stocked with every utensil you could need. As an old house owner and antique collectors ourselves, We loved all the antiques placed around the house. The master bedroom was cozy but spacious. We all felt very comfortable there and the kids have already asked to return soon!

Lots of things to see and do. Our grandsons had a ball and kept us going all day !   Wonderful place to visit.

We had a very relaxing April weekend. Chilly and sunny and very few people. Wonderful house just a short walk to Fort Rock Park! House is furnished comfortably with a cabin feel. The bunk loft was a perfect spot for the kids to watch a movie. We are looking forward to returning to this house again!

Had a very relaxing time!  Kind of in the off-season, not crowded a plus!  Loved the place. Just as shown in the pictures.  Very nice.  Definitely will visit again.

9 Cedar Lane is a perfect cabin for two couples - not overly large or formal, but all the comforts of home - just what we wanted for a ski vacation in Central Oregon - and we even had the good fortune of new snow on Mt. Bachelor.  We'll return.

We enjoyed our stay at 9 Cedar Lane very much.  Attractive and fun decor and a lovely home to stay in for a ski vacation.  The clock in the thermostat was set incorrectly and the heat came on randomly, but that's a minor issue and certainly didn't affect our stay.

We were extremely pleased with this property.  Everything was incredibly clean and the house was very nicely and tastefully decorated which made for an incredibly pleasant and comfortable stay.  It felt just like home.

Loved the house and the set-up.  Very peaceful.  LOTS to do.

This home was great for our family. The bunk area in the loft was a fun hangout for the kids. The back porch was comfortable for meals and the BBQ worked very well. We would definitely consider 9 Cedar for future visits to Sunriver.

9 Cedar lane is a great house we loved the location.  Very clean and cozy.  The house had plenty of kitchen utensils and pots/pans. There was even some very cool board games there!!

Loved this place! It had everything we needed for the weekend - including some bikes in the garage! Beautiful, easy to follow trails made our rides perfect! Very pleased!

I would recommend vacasarentals to anyone looking for a place for a vacation. First I liked that they listed full rental  price including taxes and fees. All other places I looked at would not be upfront with these fees. The detailed email communication was very personalized and nice. Will use again for next vacation for sure.

Bright, colorful, fun: all apt descriptions of popular and pleasant Sunriver, where the high desert climate draws thousands of visitors all year 'round. They could also describe this beautiful three-bedroom home, nestled among the quiet tree-lined cul-de-sacs of the resort. With this home's 55-inch LED TV with Blu Ray & Netflix, Ping-Pong and foosball table, and its proximity to golfing, water sports, and recreation of all kinds in exciting Sunriver, good times await both indoors and out!

On sunny days, the living area of this large home is flooded with light from multiple windows. After a day on the slopes of nearby Mount Bachelor, thaw out in front of the gorgeous and efficient wood fireplace with its handsome stone facade. Bring along some of your favorite CDs for the player, or DVDs to watch on the big flat screen. Make a cup of cocoa and sink into the comfy furniture surrounded by a lively combination of elegant hardwood floors and vibrant colors. You'll be able to hop on the Internet as well with the free WIFI, so bring the laptop or tablet.

4 East Butte can accommodate up to six hungry people, and when mealtime does come, your cook will have everything necessary to create the perfect meal. Along with the obligatory fridge and oven with gas range (for that just-right flame), there's also a microwave for quick snacks and movie popcorn, dishwasher, and coffee grinder for that perfect cup of morning joe. Serve every meal up in the special eating area, where your meal comes with a beautiful view of the pastoral surroundings.

Brightly painted and continuing the mountain-themed decor, each of the three bedrooms has its own distinct character, plus TVs in each for late night viewing. Two bedrooms on the main floor each have king beds. Kids will love the room upstairs where they'll sleep on a cool pyramid double/twin bunk bed. For real relaxation, step to the deck outside the master bedroom and lounge in the large enclosed hot tub. There are two full bathrooms on the main floor, so there's little waiting time.

When you're ready to explore, there are lots of options! For instance, grab one of the four adult bikes and venture out on the path running past the house. Or, with your six free passes in hand, head over to Sunriver's SHARC aquatic facility with its outdoor and indoor pools, water slides, tot pool, lazy river, and year-round tubing park. Hike, bike, kayak, climb and raft in Deschutes National Forest, just a couple miles to the west. The Village at Sunriver has lots of places to shop and dine, including a local landmark, Goody's ice cream shop.

Make your stay in Sunriver fun-filled and loaded with good memories. While you're there, this beautiful home - with all its amenities and proximity to sites and recreation that make Sunriver so popular - is waiting to be your vacation headquarters.

We enjoyed our stay.  Thank you.

The Good: The amenities for the most part were great. Large TV with good sound, foosball, ping pong table, 4 adult bikes (should provide one smaller one), a broken hot tub, 6 Sharc passes, washer/dryer and a grill.

The Bad: The screen doors and sliding glass doors need to be fixed or replaced as they're very hard to open and close, and on the verge of falling apart. The garage door was also a huge mess, it looked horrible from the outside and the door wasn't even hooked up to the garage door opener on the inside. I actually had to manually open and close it, and I since I could not lock the garage door from the inside as the lock wouldn't slide the whole way over. I had to lock the door attached to the home and hope and pray no one would break in via the garage. Lastly was the broken hot tub. Why offer patrons a hot tub when only 1/3 of it actually works and the other 2/3 is broken? Not only was 2/3 of it broken, but when we climbed in shortly after our arrival we were shocked to see the temperature gage reading 98 degrees. On our next night after doing activities all day we came home to relax to our 91 degree hot tub!? We were only able to use the hot tub at the full 104 degrees on our last day, as it seems someone had accidentally set it on sleep mode when cleaning it before our stay.

Overall our stay was nice, we did enjoy the kitchen and what it had to offer as well as most of our amenities, but with the issues we encountered, unfortunately with all the options in Sunriver we will not be renting this property again.

Absolutely loved our stay at the cabin. The accommodations were perfect for my family of six. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our meals, the table in the kitchen fit us all perfect and was great for playing games around. The atmosphere of the cabin with all the colors, the fireplace, comfy couches, recliners and the "icing on the cupcake" the private spa on the deck. We were all so happy that we had such a nice place to stay for our Christmas vacation.

Loved the cabin feel.  The wood stove was amazing.  The garage is plum full of wood and the fire heats the place up real quick!  Our kids loved the upstairs room and ping pong table, husband loved the TV, Mom loved the hot tub!  Can't wait to come back.

This house was very comfortable for four adults. We had two grandchildren one night and they were settled upstairs. Probably would not recommend the third bedroom for an adult couple. Other members of our family rented other houses, but ours was the one with the cabin feel. All of the wood cupboards, furniture, fun colors, etc, really gave you the "cabin in the woods" feel. There was one small issue that we called to have looked at and someone was sent within 10 minutes. Can't beat that for service. We loved Sunriver in our first visit, but not our last.

We had a great time and had no problems.

I booked this house for 2 nights while a few of us attended a conference for work. It was close to the conference center area (not close enough to walk). The home is VERY comfortable. The furnishing were cozy and great for kicking back and reading, playing games, watching tv and visiting. I would definitely return to this home!

House is cute, and in a great location, nice big beds with cozy sheets, great foosball and pingpong! For the price, we were pretty happy, but think I'd be pretty upset to pay in- season price, based on amenities condition. Do not expect to have any movies play on Netflix, could barely get a movie loaded, before losing  internet connection..Would be nice if bikes were not all cruisers, and a couple were 10speeds...very hard on knees going up hills with one speed! Also great that we could bring our dog! overall, we had a great time!

Overall we had a great time here and would stay here again. Just make sure if you are planning on doing any cooking that you bring everything you need. Very limited on pots, pans, etc. if you plan on cooking for more than a few people.

My friends and I stayed here for a few nights and it was great to find out that it is literally down the street from the Sunriver market (didn't have to navigate all the round-a-bouts). The sound system is awesome and the tv is huge! Make sure to bring ziploc bags and aluminum foil.

Relax on the comfortable leather chairs as you take in a movie on the large flatscreen TV. You can even pop in a DVD if you can't find anything to watch on the cable channels.

The outstanding part of renting this house was the assistance of Troy Sundernan of Vacasa. He was very helpful in every way and really went above and beyond for us when we forgot things at the house. We really had no issues when we were staying there but based on his quick and patient assistance with things we left behind I feel certain that he would resolve any issues quickly and professionally.

We loved staying at the Irish Mt Lane house.  It had a great location, right across the street from the park.  It was a quick drive or nice bike ride to the Sharc and getting to the village.  The house was very comfortable and cozy, lots of room for the kids to play and had great kitchen space. It was awesome to have the passes for the Sharc and the hot tub was very clean. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!

This property had the perfect set-up for two families. We all had plenty of room to sleep and plentiful bathrooms. The kids enjoyed the game room. The big remodeled kitchen was very nice. It was great to use the bikes in the property so that we did not have to bring our own.

The house was a perfect setting for our family gathering. The only disappointment, the owners do not have a membership to the gym. However, they do have one with SHARC which is for tennis and swimming. Thanks again!

Good multi-family set up because there are three big masters and a huge bunk room for kids.

This property was perfect for a 50th Birthday Week-end.  We had four couples and one single, and the house was able to accomodate everyone privately.  The pool table was a bonus as well.  The only bummer was there wasn't any snow around the house.

It's rare to find 2 Master suites with king beds and adjoining bathrooms - the house was perfect for 2 families and our teen to young-adult kids.  All 4 bedrooms have a connecting bath, and there's a half bath in the main living area.  The kitchen accommodated many cooks and the large dining table fit our table for 8.  We had a fire going in the large rock fireplace the entire time with ample firewood to keep it going.  Thank you!

This is one of my favorite homes in Sunriver.  It has a massive great room that's been renovated quite nicely.  The bedrooms are a little dated, but still quite nice - with lots of masters, and a huge bunk room/play room.  It's also right across from Fort Rock Park (Tennis, Playgrounds) - which is a nice plus.  We had a great time here.

This house was perfect for our extended family.  Everyone had their own bathroom, the kids shared the bunk room.  Loved the kitchen and living area, large enough for all of us.  Great newer hot tub enjoyed by all.

Huge house with a huge custom kitchen, vaulted ceilings, natural wood and rock fireplace.  Nothing felt "rental" about this kitchen or this house.  It was located on a looped street with a few other house set far apart from one another with a lot of trees, so felt secluded.  An amazing place to walk your dog just across the street.  We saw several deer in the backyard.  Hot tub was very nice and heated to 104 and the stars were amazing! We will definitely be back.  Very comfy beds too.  The free pool passes let you go to the new outdoor pools that also have the huge tube slides.  There are pools there for all ages and so worth going.  This actually made my summer.

We have rented the Irish Mountain house for 8 or 9 days in the Summer's of 6 dfferent years.  Good testimony as to how well it works for the 3 generations (g-parents, kids, & g-kids) of us!

Kitchen is the most well-stocked we've ever seen in one of our rentals. Loved the counter bar space with all of the stools.  Wonderful place for family vacation. Close to Fort Rock Park, can bike to country store, SHARC, the village, and to the marina.

We were a family of ten. Grandpa & Grandma, two daughters and their spouses and four young boys - ages 9 down to a 3 month old baby.  My daughters liked the fact that they each had their own bathrooms.  My grandsons loved the sleeping on the top bunks in the bunk room  The pool table in the bunkroom was used.  Nana and the 6 year old are about evenly matched at pool -- so fun!  Kitchen was great - all the pots, utensils were there and it was big and able to accommodate more than one cook.

Looked like the kitchen had been updated with granite counters. etc. The hot tub worked fine and was used by all at one time or another.  Passes to Sharc were appreciated as well as the many bicycles. (Although we did bring a very small bike for the 6 year old and there was not one of suitable size for him.

If Vacassa could have arranged for one more day of sunshine, it would have been perfect.  No really, we had a great time!

Vacasa staff went out of their way to accommodate our group and make our stay great!!  6 Irish Mtn Ln was fully equipped with everything we needed, and each of the 4 bedrooms had their own bathroom!  It was right across the street from Fort Rock Park, and not far from SHARC.  We will definitely use Vacasa next time we go to Sunriver, and will likely stay at the same house.

Our Vacasa experience was very positive.  Starting with booking the rental, to helping with our ski passes the staff was positive.

The house was very roomy and accomodating.  Especially liked the fact each bedroom had its own bathroom.

I would definitely stay again.

The house was better than advertised!  Tremendous kitchen with all the tools and equipment we needed.  The big, new refrigerator was more than adequate and everything worked, including the Wi-fi.  The big bedrooms were great and the bunk room has a new, flat screen that the kids loved.  The pool table in the bunk room has been recently renovated and leveled, and was the site of several competitions.

Our only comment would be that the garbage storage (outside shed) was nearly stuffed full when we arrived and that some interior light bulbs had burned out.

Vacasa was very responsive to our needs.

Overall, we were very satisfied with this property.

We come to Sunriver every year with our family...this home by far met our needs completely!  The 4 bedroom suites with one being suited for teens with the pool table and bunk beds was perfect.  The huge kitchen was well stocked and made cooking for the crew enjoyable because of the open layout.  The only thing we missed were passes to Maverick center because we like the Flowrider surfing.  The weather was beautiful and ski/snowboard conditions some of the best we've had!  The discount ski pass was an unbelievable bargain and we used all 3 days.  Thanks...we will definitely reserve here for next year!

The Vacasa staff was great! Very responsive when we called on Wednesday night trying to get help with the oven that didn't work. We were mildly panicked wondering how we were going to cook Thanksgiving dinner. But Melanie(?) was super helpful and had the maintenance guy at our rental within a half hour of my first call. Scott was awesome, but unable to fix the stove. They were able to give us access to another house not too far away to use the oven for the turkey. It all worked out fine in the end and dinner was excellent. On another note, the smoke alarm decided to start beeping (dead battery) at 3am on Friday and we had to compeltely disconnect it to get it to stop. Suggestion for the pool table room, our boys felt that they may have used that room more if they could've hooked their X-Box up to the TV in there and if they could've seen the TV from the pool table area. Was a really weird set up in that room. Make it more cozy and update the TV so that kids can hook their game systems up. For the cost of renting that house per night, it'd make sense if all of the TV's were current.

The trip was amazing and everyone had a blast, however it was like two different houses in one. The down-stairs is totally modern and the up-stairs is very out dated. For all the money it costs people to stay here i would think the house could afford to put flat screens in the rooms instead of the tube t.v with one station. Also i think the biggest disappointment was one of the houses renting points, the pool table... Ya the house has one like advertised, what isnt advertised is that its missed a leveling peg, there are 13 balls instead of 15 and alot of those 13 balls are duplicate numbers. We still had a great time we were just limited to one spot in the house, downstairs.

6 Irish Mountain is a very outdated property.   It was built in 1980.  With the exception of the kitchen,  all furnishings/trim/fixtures/bedding appear to be original.  The pool table wasn't in working order - no cue ball and the door to the ball collector fell off when my 3 year old daughter touched it, almost landing on her foot. You might as well remove the pool table. Also, please remove the VCRs.  I'd have to think they haven't been used in years.  This has probably been a very good investment property for the owner.  I see the owner has listed it for sale.  Those two factors lead me to believe the owner has little incentive to invest in and update the property.  If you want nice this isn't for you.  If you want something large with Super 8 motel like furnishings then this will do.

Loved this home, our stay was celebrating our sons 17 birthday with a total of six teenagers and two adults. The upstair area was enjoyed by the kids. This home is welcoming and felt very homey. We try to get to sunriver twice year and hope to stay in this home again.

We had a family reunion in the area, and had over 130 attendee's.  Our house was a great location for the park,where we had our dinners every night. We loved to go over and play tennis, volleyball and baseball.  The kids would bike everywhere and I loved to walk and the paths were great for that.

We absolutely LOVEd this place. The location near the park is perfect and the fact that is has a very nice living room AND a game room is perfect for a multiple family getaway. The kitchen is also top notch. Thank you!

The kitchen was stocked amazingly well for a rental. We loved the layout of the house and the location to the park.

Our family loved this house!  It was stocked with everything we could possibly need, very nice and comfy, and just perfect for the price.  We are already making plans for next year at the same home!

The home was very nice, lots of room for all. Close to the park for the kids which was nice.

Great house, we will be contacting Vacasa about a summer rental

Settle down into the cushions of the comfy red sofa and talk about the day's adventures or on chilly nights, curl up with a good book and a glass of wine next to the gas fireplace.

This exceeded my expectations. In a great location and everything about the property was perfect.

My family LOVED this house.  We stayed here for 4 nights but wished it could've been longer.  It was super close to everything and immaculate.  We would definitely stay here again.

Overall this home is a nice place to stay that is close to everything including the Shark Center, the Village, golfing, biking, etc.   The hot tub is very nice with room for family and friends to sit around and visit.  The BBQ worked great.  The layout of the home is great with a fabulous fireplace and nice living room furniture . . . oh . . . and the cable TV was nice and really did work. A lot of times you go places and it doesn't but that is not the case at this home. Thank you for the use of your home.

Very nice, clean, comfortable house. Not far from the village or Sharc. Has a great modern kitchen with a huge fridge, freezer, and a wonderful private hot tub.

It was very pleasant, very quiet as we were the only people on the street.

This isn't a bad place to stay, it's close the the SHARC and easy to get around.  The house itself has good space and the layout is ok.  The furniture is outdated, and some of it is broken (the recliner and also an upstairs foldout couch).  Screen doors don't slide on their tracks and the TV looks like it's from the early 90's.  I think there are better values in Sunriver so I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend.

We didn't care for Sunriver- felt like the only thing to really do was the water park and ride bikes. Thought there was more involved. Probably won't be back for a long time.

This was a very cute cabin in a wonderful location.  If you don't mind some outdated furniture and electronics than this place is great for a couple of small families.

This is our fourth time to stay at Sunriver and our first at this location. For a single family of five it was perfect. We would have had room for two more people if we needed it. The house has a great location close to ft. rock, sharc, and sunriver main village. The sharc passes for six make this place even more attractive and totally worth it. If we are coming here as just our family again we will look to stay here again. Well worth the money!

I'm a Southern CA born grandmother with no real snow experience.  This little

chalet in the Sun River resort area was a beasutiful introduction to life in a snow

forest.  The home is toasty warm.  My little brown poodle-ish dog  loved the

big window were he could sit a monitor the squirrel population.   My great

grandson enjoyed doing a jig saw puzzle on the dining table and watching his

favorite TV shows on the TV.    The home was well equipped with everything

we could have needed.    We didn't use the bikes or Shark passes but had

weather been different,   we would have perhaps.

We had a major snowfall...my first!

I enjoyed the fact that the bedroom downstairs had a queen and twin bed, so

when grandson visited, we could be downstairs.   The downstairs sofa also

made up into a bed had it been needed.

Upstairs was lovely master bedroom and cute loft.  We didn't use it, but

in younger years, I would have loved it!

The only problems  encourtered were... the sliding glass door key was difficult

to open and close.!!   For several  weeks I had trouble with the trash can area,  and my  grandson who lives in the asrea would have to assist me.  The finatl week, I met the trash man and asked if he would leave the trash can upright instead of upside down as there was no way I could use it.  He was most helpful  and quickly fixed it.    A carport would have been nice in snow but there were

serveral great parking areas, and my car did beautifully.

This is a little home away from home....reminded me of a place Heidi of storybook lore would have loved.   With the snow,  a Robert Frost setting truly!

I thank the owners for opening this lovely spot and giving many of us memories

we'll treasure!

My family had a great time here.   This home had everything we needed for our extended weekend in Sunriver.  Walking distance to SHARC and the bike trail right out back.  Plenty of parking and lots of space.  A very enjoyable time.

We had a great time here! Its close to everything and anything you need.  Your close to shopping, fishing, skiing,  ice skating,  the rec center, and even Bend and La Pine if you feel like venturing out of Sunriver.   Its tucked out of the way and quiet.  You have neighboring houses but you don't hear them.  We had two couples there, and it was a perfect fit.  We had plenty of room.  We could have fit 2 more people easily.

Cute house but pretty dirty. We had to vacuum right when we got there. It's small so be ready. Great location though

Highlights: close to SHARC and Village! Two bedrooms with loft. Three queen beds and an additional twin in downstairs bedroom. No AC. Front and back decks with plenty of seating, BBQ.

We had a wonderful time at 3 Lofty Lane! We certainly would stay here again. Thanks!

Great location in sunriver.  Can walk to SHARC and to the village in 10 mins

Bike paths everywhere are nice.

Multiple bikes of various sizes are very nice to use.

We stayed with our two teenage daughters at 3 Raccoon Lane.  The house was very clean and adequately equipped.  Needed some lightbulbs replaced and we found some in the closet so all was well.  Great supply of firewood in the garage and so nice to have that crackling fire every night.  Great deck out front.  This house is a really short walk across Beaver Rd to the SHARC, and not a long bike ride to the village.  There is a train that goes by a few times a day and night, but it was totally not a problem at all, in fact we kind of enjoyed it!  :-)

This house is conveniently located near the SHARC and basketball court. It was an easy bike ride to and from the house.

Nice place for two families. Great location, close to everything.

We are a family of five (kids 11-17). This was an ideal location with access to Sharc and the village. Nice division of space let us vacation as a family with plenty of elbow room. We loved spending time on the deck with just the right amount of sunlight filtering through the trees. What a great vacation! We'll be back!

When you stay in this newly remodeled, pet-friendly three-bedroom Sunriver vacation home, you'll enjoy mountain lodge ambiance in the pleasant high-desert climate of Sunriver Resort. This particular homes boasts a great location in a quiet neighborhood close to SHARC and Fort Rock Park.

Relaxing will be easy in this home's beautifully appointed living area where you'll sink into the sinfully soft comfort of its leather furniture below wood-paneled ceilings that arch up, creating a space that's cozy and comfortable. After a day of meandering in the kayak you rented to explore the nearby Deschutes River, warm those achy bones in the evening by the grand wood fireplace with rock facade, feet appropriately elevated with your favorite drink in hand. Start a game of cards as you listen to some of your favorite tunes on the stereo. After dinner, watch TV on the huge flat screen, or gather 'round for a movie on the DVD player.

If you enjoy cooking, you'll be well situated with this gorgeous, fully equipped kitchen, complete with modern appliances, microwave, and a dishwasher. You'll walk on a earth-tone tiled floor in an atmosphere that's well-lit with plenty of overhead and natural light. The dining table seats six comfortably, but when the weather's nice, you can dine outdoors on the nicely furnished patio surrounded by Ponderosa pines. There's also a gas grill if you feel like hosting a barbecue, and plenty of space for the younger guests to play a game of tag or catch while dinner's cooking.

7 Flat Top has three bedrooms. There's a bedroom on the main floor with a queen bed, continuing the same "ski" theme of the living room. If you're staying in winter, the skis above your head will remind you Mount Bachelor, and fun day on the slopes, aren't far away! If you're not sleepy, watch a little TV before bed. Follow the snow shoes up to the second floor where you'll find two more bedrooms, one with a double bed, another  -  perfect for the kids!  -  with a trundle bed (double on bottom, single on top). There are two tastefully decorated full bathrooms, one on each floor.

This home truly is meant for families to have a fun and relaxing getaway. The washer/dryer makes it easy to keep hiking gear fresh and clean, and the garage has a Ping-Pong table and rack stocked with four adult bikes and two for kids. Head out on one of the dozens of miles of paved trails that will take you through pastoral beauty and shopping and dining in the Village at Sunriver.

Golfers can take the clubs over to nearby Meadows Golf Course (or one of the three other courses in Sunriver) and tee up. The Deschutes River, where you can kayak, raft, or fish, runs along the western edge of the resort. Have a picnic at Fort Rock Park or head over to Sunriver's SHARC facility, an amazing aquatic center with outdoor and indoor pools, water slides, tot pool, lazy river, and year-round tubing park. Eight passes will be included with your stay!

In the winter, skiers will find world class skiing at Mt. Bachelor, about a half-hour to the north where there are also sleigh rides, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and bonfires in the snow. No matter what time of year, there's always something fun to do in scenic Sunriver. And when you come, make sure you make this lovely home your getaway headquarters!

We really enjoyed our stay at this house in Sunriver.  We played Ping Pong every day and enjoyed the bikes.  The house is in a nice location with quick access to a bike path and a nice walk or quick ride to Fort Rock park.  The house is very comfortable and has a nice variety of books, movies, and games available.

We would recommend this house!

We loved the house, especially the vintage ski decor touches, stone fireplace and wood ceiling . . . all contributed to the cabiny feel.

We did find ourself baking cookies a few times and would have loved a larger cookie sheet and cooling rack. More foil and paper towels would have been handy too. Also, the toilet paper roll upstairs was missing half of the core so the spring was showing. Loved everything else, shtanks

It was situated in a cul-de-sac area, very quite surroundings. Loved the house! Clean and well stocked.

Well furnished and comfortable home.  Very welcoming.  Evidence of thoughtfulness everywhere.  Kitchen was convenient with good kitchen ware, bedrooms quiet and restful. .  We did miss having a private outdoor seating area.  With this home when you sit on the deck, it's like you're on stage with 2-story windows of multiple neighbors looking down at you.  We ended up crowding around the single entrance bench for a more private feeling.

Also we couldn't figure out how to work the stacking washing machine - the control panel had icons but no labels, not obvious. There was a handout for the dryer but not for the washer.   But we would still stay again.  Good vibes cabin!

Loved the plethora of bikes for our use.  So much easier than carting our own. Also, we were there for a Bend baseball tournament and were pleased with the easy commute into Bend.

We enjoyed your house very much.  It was the perfect  for the occasion we went to Sunriver for; our son's 16th birthday celebration.  Thank you for sharing it with us.

Our family really enjoyed our stay at this home. A lot of thought was put into making sure all the comforts of home were available.  We will definitely stay again at this great home in Sunriver.  We also appreciated the close contact we had with the Vacasa staff during our stay. Our questions were promptly answered.

We enjoyed our stay in Sunriver again and tried out a new house - 7 Flat Top. Overall, it was a nice clean house with all the amenities you'd expect. At first I didn't think I'd like the deck area being in front but the culdesac was quiet and it enabled us to watch the kids biking in the culdesac as the adults relaxed on the deck so it worked out perfectly!  We did have young children (ages 2 and 3) with us and the only thing I would mention for folks that have young kids is that the banister upstairs is very open so if you have young kids and plan to put them in any of the two rooms upstairs, I'd be cautious.  We loved the bikes and the SHARC passes that were included in this rental!

Beautiful, comfy home, close to everything. Our only issue was stair railings are not safe for small children! Our 2 year old could easily climp through them and we were worried the whole time he would fall, so we had to block the stairs or be with him constantly... which made it hard to relax! Otherwise, the home is great!

We loved this place. The size, furnishings, floor plan, etc. couldn't be beat. We tried to rent it for the following week-end and were disappointed that it was already booked. It felt like home.

The house was very clean, and well stocked with kitchen supplies.  The SHARC aquatic center was about a 5 minute drive away, and the surroundings  were tranquil and natural. We enjoyed the provided bikes, the clean kitchen, and the board games that were in the house.  The flat screen tv's in the house (living room and bedrooms) were nice, but the outside was really the attraction for biking and walking. It is also near a community park with kids climbing attractions.   This is a well kept, thoughtful house for a family getway.

We were so pleased with this house from the moment we walked in; we really liked the cozy, "cabiny" feel and the bedrooms were great. The big square coffee table in the living room was perfect for game nights (and the house comes stocked with quite a few!) and there was a big collection of CD's and movies as well. If you have kids, Fort Rock Park is really close by. If you enjoy wildlife, this area seems to be a popular deer hangout - always had one or two camped out and spending the day out back! The bathrooms are nothing fancy, but they are clean and very adequate. We were very comfortable here and it was a great home base for our Sunriver experience!

We had a great time in Sunriver! Thanks for making our stay more enjoyable! Providing the Sharc passes was a huge bonus! We will be back!

Really nice check in process- super helpful!  The home is comfortable and had everything we needed.  We were a little concerned that no air conditioning would be really hot in July but it was not a problem at all with shaded area and temps that drop so much at night.  Really good movie, book and game selection. Thank you!

The owners of this vacation rental seem to know how to please their guests.  Nice amenities. Well-stocked kitchen The bikes were great! Comfortable house. We are a family of 6.  2 adults, 4 children ages 7-15 and we all had a fantastic time.  We are grateful that this turned into an awesome family vacation. So much to do in Sunriver. We will be back!

This 3,200 square foot Sunriver vacation home sits on an acre of land just three miles from Sunriver Resort in Oregon's high desert. From here, you can be at Mt. Bachelor for a day of skiing or snowboarding in about 18 minutes, and just three blocks away, you'll also have access to a private boat ramp on the Deschutes River. But aside from the great location, this home has recently been renovated and is beautifully decorated, with exquisite Persian rugs throughout, and great entertainment amenities like a game room and private hot tub outside!

Inside on the main level, you'll find an elegant living room, dining room, and full kitchen. Relax on the leather couch in front of the toasty wood stove. There's a coffee table for spreading out snacks or a board game, and plenty of room for adults, kids, and dogs to make themselves right at home. Or, after everyone has gone to bed, sit back in the plush chair and enjoy a nightcap while you use the WiFi to catch up on emails.

As elegant as this area of the house is, the game room is pure fun! Here you'll have a poker table, fooseball table, air hockey, a large flat screen TV with a Wii, and a wet bar. While some guests play in there, others can relax in the bright, sunny movie room and enjoy a 46-inch flat screen TV with an XBOX 360 and stream favorite shows or movies on Netflix.

For formal meals, a large wooden table seats up to six, with more spots available nearby at the breakfast bar. When you do want to prepare a meal, the large, gourmet kitchen is sure to inspire the chef in your group. There are stainless steel appliances, a beautiful tile floor, ample counter space and extras like a coffee grinder, slow cooker, blender, and mixer, so you can let your culinary aspirations take over!

Outside, sit around the fire pit after dinner and roast marshmallows for s'mores. And on nice afternoons, you can use the gas grill for everything from a feast of rosemary-balsamic marinated lamb chops to a platter of cheeseburgers and hot dogs. The half an acre yard is enclosed so the kids and dogs have room to play and enjoy the Central Oregon sunshine, and there is plenty of room and seating for outdoor entertaining. Out here, you'll also have a basketball hoop, horseshoe pit, and a swing set. And if you want to soothe those sore muscles, just have a soak in the private hot tub!

Other amenities include a stereo, books, and a washer and dryer - so you don't have to worry about staying clean while out exploring.

This Central Oregon vacation rental is close to a number of activities - boating on the Deschutes River (there's even room for boat parking and RVs in the driveway), a day spent hiking or biking along the Deschutes National Forest trail, or you can borrow the four kids bikes and ride around the neighborhood.

In winter, spend the day skiing and snowboarding at Mount Bachelor, or do some snowshoes and trek around the National Forest trails. Year-round, Bend is an easy day trip at just 20 miles away. Spend the day brewery hopping, browsing galleries, or shopping at the Old Mill District. For the more adventurous, make the drive an hour southeast for a day exploring the beautiful desert landscape at Fort Rock State Natural Area.

No matter how you spend your time at this Sunriver vacation rental, one thing is sure - you'll never run out of things to do! From its elegant design, great entertainment amenities, and ideal high desert location, this Mt. Bachelor Lodge is an ideal home base for a memorable central Oregon group getaway!

This cozy three-bedroom Sunriver vacation home offers peace and relaxation in a wonderful location on a quiet side street near Fort Rock Park. With a spacious back deck overlooking the surrounding pine trees and a luxurious outdoor hot tub, you may be tempted to never leave the property despite being surrounded by all the activities and amenities of Sunriver!

With ample windows, exposed timber beams, and warm hardwoods, the entire home feels simultaneously sunny and spacious yet wonderfully cozy. The living area's vaulted ceilings and wide windows make the space feel open and bright, while the plush seating and gas fireplace invite you to curl up by the fire and unwind. The flat-screen TV is equipped with cable and Blu-Ray for cozy movie nights.

The open kitchen and dining area are adjacent to the living room, so everyone can socialize even while preparing meals or tidying up after dinner. On one end of the dining area, a set of French doors opens to the wide deck, letting the pine-scented air and summer sunshine flow into the home. The kitchen is fully equipped for preparing family meals, with updated stainless steel appliances (including dishwasher), countertop accessories like a toaster, blender, and coffee grinder, and plenty of pots and pans, utensils, glasses, dinnerware, and serving dishes.

The dining table seats six comfortably, but when the weather's nice, the deck's picnic table may prove irresistible! A nice gas grill awaits your barbecues, and a leisurely soak in the private hot tub is the perfect way to begin and end each day. Linger over a glass of wine as the sun sets, and you may even catch a glimpse of neighboring wildlife passing through the backyard.

If the weather turns gray, don't worry: the garage has a full-sized PingPong table to ward off rainy day blues, or head to SHARC to take advantage of the indoor swimming pools! Your stay includes six complimentary passes.

At bedtime, there are three bedrooms to choose from. The upper level of the home has a master bedroom with king bed and a second bedroom with a queen. Downstairs, the third bedroom has a brand new trundle bed with a twin on top and a full-sized bed underneath. With two full baths and a washer/dryer provided to keep packing light, the home is very comfortable for up to six guests. Wireless Internet makes it easy on guests who need to stay connected while away.

Sunny and warm, this special family home is waiting to welcome you on your next Sunriver getaway!

This house was perfectly clean, decorated nicely and comfy without feeling cluttered. Everything worked. The hot tub was well maintained. The kitchen is well stocked with cooking gear. The king bed in the master bedroom is very comfy. The only thing we didn't like was that the two "adult" bedrooms upstairs share a jack-and-jill bathroom, which might be fine for some, but for us nocturnal types used to the privacy of ensuite bathrooms was an inconvenience with two couples using the upstairs. The property description should clearly state this. Otherwise, everything was great and we would rent this house again, especially if we were the only couple staying there.

We loved our week at 15 Filbert in Sunriver! The house was comfortable and had everything we needed for a restful and fun week. Close walk to Fort Rock Park, which was perfect for our toddler. Decent bike ride to the village center, using the bikes at the house, which was just the exercise we were looking for. The hot tub was clean and refreshing. We cooked a lot, and the kitchen was well-appointed. We loved our time here, and would recommend this house to other families vacationing in the area.

We loved to stay at Filbert 15,  everything we needed was there. We felt very welcomed and the kids had a blast. We would love to come back in the summer. Only thing is that our son forgot his most favorite little stuffed animal tiger there. Now he has not been found, so if  you see him , he is about 8 inches tall and wears some funky pants. Our son is still hoping his tiger can be found, maybe under the couch? Have a wonderful stay and contact us if you see LULU the tiger.

15 Filbert is comfortable and cozy, with quick access to the aquatic center and the village.

Great place, very we'll supplied kitchen, excellent hot tub.  Looking forward to a future stay !!!

I rented this house for our last vacation before school starts.  I was really happy with the amenities and we enjoyed the hot tub in the evening ( complete with baby deer grazing just feet from us).  The kitchen had everything we needed and the washer and dryer were well used.  The house was in a quiet location with a safe culd-e-sac for the kids to ride bikes in while I prepared dinner.  The Grill worked perfect. The beds were comfortable and the kids downstairs bedroom/Den was a big hit. The house was comfortable and well laid out. There were several bikes in the garage but we brought our own to use.  No kid bikes so bring your own or rent at one of the many rental shops at the Village.  There is a new bike path that goes all the way to Lava lands park that is longish but pretty amazing.  We spent an evening at the observatory and it was a highlight of our trip.  I Can now point out the north star with ease.  The trip was such a big hit that we will be back during the winter for some skiing and snow play!

We loved our stay at 15 filbert lane. House was clean, cozy, and air conditioned!  Lots of stuff to do:  bike rides, swimming, sight-seeing, relaxing in hot tub, and shopping. Couldn't have asked for a better visit to Sunriver.

This was our absolute favorite family vacation yet. The house was absolutely perfect for our family of 4 (with room to spare). Everything felt so clean and well taken care of. We loved the little extras that came with it- the SHARC passes, the extra blankets & pillows, bikes, pack and play, even the pancake griddle. It was so easy to feel right at home. Dinners on the deck, smores over the grill, evenings in the hot tub were all perfect. Thank you for providing a quality place to stay.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 15 Filbert in Sunriver!  We had all the creature comforts of home and then some. The peace and quiet was amazing, making for an especially restful and refreshing time away from home. Enjoyed the bikes, the walking paths, the BBQ and hot tub!  Especially appreciated the thoughtful manner in which the home was outfitted with supplies in the kitchen and, of course, the WiFi!  Thank you so much!  We would do this again in a heartbeat!

Charming little house. Our family of five were very comfortable here and enjoyed our stay very much. We would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to a friend.

Perfect place for us...3 adults and a teen.  Loved all of the windows. It made the place bright and cheery. The only TV  other than the one in the living room is in the bedroom with the trundle bed. The openness of the kitchen/dinning room/ living room was great. The only thing we didn't find in the kitchen was measuring spoons.  We enjoyed the ping pong table and bikes. We'll maintained...there was even a bucket of salt for ice on the entranceway. All in all...nice little place for a getaway!

This is a very warm and cozy place. Very clean and comfortable. We took the bikes out for several bike rides and stopped at the Village to eat at one of the nice restaurants. My wife cooked breakfast and dinner and found all the appliances just right. Highly recommended!

The house was perfect for my family of 4 and our 2 friends (couple).  Well equipped kitchen, plenty of towels, and everyone enjoyed the ping pong table.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had great family time-relaxing in the hot tub, going on bike rides, playing ping pong. It was wonderful that the property came with these amenities.

Stay at your own private sanctuary at this amazing, pet-friendly (for one dog), three-bedroom Central Oregon vacation rental. The very name Shanti means peace, calmness, and tranquillity and you'll find all of that here! Spend blissful summer mornings viewing the wildlife from your deck overlooking the Deschutes River or survey the tree-filled property right from the deck. Inside, the design aesthetic is Eastern-influenced with a bright and open great room, shiny hickory floors, and colorful touches throughout.

This tranquil getaway is literally half a block from the edge of La Pine State Park, where miles of trails await your year-round adventures! The opportunities for hiking, mountain biking, trail running, snow shoeing, cross country skiing, and exploring are endless, and a few maps are provided for your convenience. World-renowned fly fishing awaits at Fall River, just a 10-minute walk from the house via the La Pine State Park trails. Feel like staying closer to home? You can float the Deschutes or fish from the property banks, or head to the campground upriver and float back home!

While the great outdoors beckons, you're still within 30 minutes of downtown Bend - and the resort town of Sunriver is less than 15 miles north. In the winter, skiing at Mt. Bachelor is a 45-minute drive away, and there's easy access to snowmobiling in the Paulina Lakes area. But even with all of those nearby options, you may choose to just spend your time near this beautiful custom house - you'll have a half of an acre of scenic, tree-filled property to explore with the dog!

Spend a lazy evening in the spacious great room curled up with a good book in front of the fireplace, under wood-beamed ceilings. The plush, sectional sofa has spots for everyone to relax after a day of hiking or skiing. This great open area has deck access for easy grilling and a wooden dining room table for meals.

The kitchen is fit for a gourmet chef with granite slab counters, shiny stainless steel appliances (including a dishwasher), and gorgeous hickory cabinetry. There's even a breakfast bar for snacks or for kitchen helpers to help grate cheese or peel potatoes. And don't forget the gas grill outside - prep some steaks in the kitchen and then head to the deck for a lazy afternoon cookout.

All of the bedrooms at this 2,000 square-foot home are located upstairs, including a gorgeous master suite with a queen sized bed and a large soaking tub with a view of the river. This spa-like room also has a rustically-elegant log bed, a wood-burning fireplace, and lovely wood-beamed ceiling. Sit in the rocking chair and watch for deer right outside the window.

The other two bedrooms also have bright, comfortable bedding, plush carpeting, and cozy accessories like throw pillows and extra blankets. One has a queen bed, while the other has a full. This wonderful vacation retreat can sleep up to six guests, including one dog with a $10 per day charge (with a minimum $40 fee per stay). There's also a washer and dryer, so you can pack lighter!

While there is no TV, there is a portable, hand-held DVD player with a sizable movie library for movies in bed, as well as a plethora of board games, card games and puzzles.  This peaceful retreat also has WiFi and plenty of space to relax and roam. Ideal for couples traveling together or group trips, the Shanti River vacation house is an amazing destination in Central Oregon to get away from it all and back to nature in the stunning high desert geography.

This area also has a number of outdoor attractions like hiking and rock-climbing in Smith Rock State Park, rafting on the Deschutes River, or even golfing at Sunriver Resort. In winter, there is access to snowmobiling in the Paulina Lakes area  or you can make the 30 mile drive to Mt. Bachelor for skiing and snow boarding, or stay closer to home for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the national forest lands.

No matter what time of year you plan your visit to this Central Oregon vacation rental, there's always something to do - snowshoe, hike, bike high desert trails, or just relax on the deck with a glass of wine. This gorgeous Shanti River Vacation Home will leave you feeling blissful and calm.

Nice place, Very Quiet! River frontage is not very usable - muddy and buggy. Bring a canoe or kayak. The Fall river is gorgeous and La Pine state park would be great for Mt Biking. No good fly fishing on this section of the Deschutes, but the fall and upper "D" are nice.

Our Air Conditioning was not functioning the entire time, so be sure to confirm that it has been fixed if you plan a summer stay.

Overall, nice place and would stay again.

Love the view, very relaxing and quiet, nice location.

The house is Very well stocked, you will find everything you may need. Could have been better with a better AC (the weather was very hot 96Â°).

The house was very well decorated and had everything we needed in the kitchen. I loved walking down the path to the river in the morning and having coffee out on the mini dock.

I've rented many homes over the past few years. This one was the best prepared of any! I was so impressed by the level of cleanliness, great cooking supplies and appliances, and even very tasteful Christmas decorations. The details like table cloths and cloth napkins made it feel very homey. My pup felt very welcomed with the basket of dog supplies. The only thing that was missing was clocks. I don't care on vacation but it helps my kids know whether it is 3 am or 6 am, when it is still pitch black outside. Thanks for all the great memories!

We had a great trip to Sunriver, plenty of room for the entire family of 6 adults and 5 children. The layout is great and the facilities are excellent. We are already planning our trip for next summer.

We have rented homes in Sunriver for 35 years.  This home is not over the top with frills you will never use  but rather very well designed and comfortable. The view from the living area of the golf course is very pretty and relaxing. The access to the Benham trail and the waterfalls is irreplacable

With family members in California and Washington, Sunriver made a great midway point to meet for a few days of skiing.  The house was ideal as there were bedrooms for everyone and the great room provided a wonderful spot for visiting, games and eating together.  The only minor issues were a couple of burned out light bulbs in crucial places (the porch and over the house number making it a little difficult to find in the dark when the arrival instructions were slight confusing).  These were minor complaints compared to the benefits of the house.

You have a lot of treats in store at 9 Cottonwood, a spacious home with handsome mountain decor. The first thing you'll notice is its great location in a beautiful, quiet area (Circle 10), very close to Woodlands Golf Course and just minutes away from all the Sunriver attractions.

Inside the house, one of the biggest treats is the hot tub sheltered with a roof and protected with windows. This kind of setting is unique in Sunriver, making it a very special place to relax in any season.

Downstairs, the great room is filled with comfortable furniture surrounding the fireplace area, which has a rock hearth and a large flat screen TV. There's plenty of room for everyone to lounge, play games or watch movies.

The open great room includes a well appointed kitchen and a lovely dining area with seating for 10. Mingling is easy, especially because the dining room opens onto the summer deck with its brand new barbecue. This is also where you'll find that fabulous hot tub.

The main floor features a master suite with a queen bed, a large bath and a private deck. Upstairs, there's a second master suite with a queen bed, a walk-in closet and a bath complete with marble tile. On the second floor, you'll also discover another full bath, a third bedroom and a loft area that will delight children and adults alike. This bunk room has a twin bed on top and a full one on the bottom.

Nice home and convenient accommodations. We were close to Sunriver Village and Mt. Bachelor skiing.

We stayed the weekend here & we didn't want to leave.  the house is very open, tons of natural light.  Very cozy.  Kitchen is a great size with stainless appliances.

Cul-de-sac is quiet & safe.  Easy to find and just minutes from the village.  We loved the massive dining table.  we played games on one side, ate on the other it was that big.  Top queen bed was like sleeping on a cloud.  Bottom queen was much firmer, but some people like that.  Kids were fine in the smaller room.  Also loved the 3 bathrooms.  That was a treat for us along with the big hot tub.

Can't wait to rent here again!

Our family had a great time visting Sunriver and staying at 9 Cottonwood.  The house was roomy and comfortable.  Any issues we had were addressed quickly by the Vacasa staff.

My family and I really enjoyed our recent stay at 9 Cottonwood.  Very nice house, very roomy with lots of extras. We would definitely stay there again.

We had a fantastic holiday in Sunriver. The whole family fit comfortably in 9 Cottonwood, and we all enjoyed kicking back to relax over New Year's. The enclosed hottub was awesome, and the house was outfitted well (furnishings, linens, kitchen). Just bring your clothes, ski gear, and favorite bottle of wine and you are set!

Our family; 3 generations, had a wonderful week in Sunriver; 9 Cottonwood Lane made it possible. This home is outfitted very well, the property manager keeps on top of things and the SHARC passes, bikes, hot tub, good gas grill and general kitchen supplies were as good or better than being at home.

This place was perfect for a multigeneration visit with kids loving the SHARC access and bicycles, grandparents loving the quiet and solitude, and all loving the evening in the private spa.  It was so large and comfortable. Everything we needed and more.  I will make sure the next visit is a much longer one.

The house exceeded our expectations.  It was a quiet spot at the end of the street.  The back porch was something we enjoyed every evening, after exploring the local area.  We loved putting some steaks on the grill and relaxing on the porch listening to the wind in the trees, with a good beverage in hand.

The house was in very good condition, clean and comfortable.  You will love sitting in the hot tub each evening after a long day.  This is some place we will return.

Excellent accommodations!  Family Fun in Sunriver.  Love the updated village, love the SHARC, and love the bike paths.  We went down with 3 generations for a 70th birthday celebration.  We had a wonderful time and are planning on returning in the summer.

This is a fantastic property...& pet friendly! Furnishings were nice, clean and modern. House next door is a little close, but was not a huge issue. Granite countertops are beautiful and kitchen was nicely appointed. Would definitely stay here again!

First time in Sunriver. We will be back!!

Easy to find for people that are not familiar with Sunriver.  Very comfortable and roomy home.  Love the second refrigerator in the garage!!!  The third bedroom is perfect for mid-size children but a little tight for teenagers.  (Both my teenagers were taller than the shower head in the upstairs hallway bathroom!)  Very funny!

We enjoyed the stay for four nights.  However, we were not able to enjoy the hot tub because the jets were very weak.  Felt more like a hot bath.  The home was roomy for four guests, and possibly more.  Had two refrigerators (one in garage) so there is plenty of room for food supplies and drinks.  With the exception of the hot tub, the home was in good condition.  Checkout procedures are a bit of a pain.

You might choose to relax in the new hot tub, watch TV in any room of the house or enjoy the free wireless Internet.

Everyone like to gather in the spacious, welcoming living room with its gas fireplace and TV with a DVD player. Cook up a storm in the fully stocked kitchen, and eat at the dining room table that seats eight. If you have a big crowd, guests can also sit on the comfortable bar chairs at the kitchen counter. For another fun option, throw some burgers on the barbecue and eat out on the lovely deck.

Family of 5 made good use of bikes/helmets, pong pong table abd hot tub plus did lots of cooking. Good time at good house. Not very modern decor but we really didn't care. Beds were good and kitchen was stocked.

This was a good home to base our daily adventures from.  We were able to enjoy this fully stocked home and it's amenities.

The house is good, it's located in a good place.   It's spacious for a family of four.  Kitchen had all the basic items, plates, utensils, etc.   All one really needs.   Water pressure in showers was very good.   Washer and Dryer worked well.   Bicycles are over-rated.   Two of the adult bikes have slow leaks in the tires, rendering them largely useless.   You'll get to your destination, but maybe not get back.   They just need some TLC maintenance and they'll be fine.    SHARC passes worked well.   We will likely rent this property again, but we'll be prepared to rent bikes or bring our own next time.

This home was very nice and clean.  We really enjoyed relaxing and using the home as a base for excursions around Sunriver and for skiing at Mt. Bachelor.  The hot tub was quite welcome after a long day of skiing.  The home was perfect for our needs.

Beautiful open floor plan with comfortable beds and fully stocked. Totally appreciated the SHARC passes, great bikes, helmets and ping pong table. They saved us so much out of pocket money.  Great barbecue and hot tub.

Loved  the lock box (not having to check in and out).Anxious to come back! again.

The house was nice, plenty of room and in a great location in Sunriver. We were near Fort Rock Park which was nice as we had little ones with us. We would definitely stay here again.

We were very pleased with the rental since it was sight unseen.   The house was very clean and enjoyed the hot tub after a round of golf!   It met our expectations and will rent again with Vacasa Rentals.  Thanks

nice property but needs more comfortable toilets

Our family was looking for a quiet, relaxing spring break getaway to Sunriver.  This home was perfect for our needs.  We loved the single story layout, open floor plan and location to Sunriver highlights including Fort Rock Park (short walk)  and SHARC (quick drive or slightly longer walk).

The house was very clean including a well maintained hot tub.  Furnishings were comfortable and the home was very child friendly.  Our 2 year old loved the selection of kids movies, DVD's and there was a great selection of board games as well.  Flat screen TV's in 2 of the bedrooms were better TV's than the one in the living room but we stayed busy enjoying the fun activities in Sunriver and the great bicycles and ping pong that are provided with the house.  We had a tough time getting the dishwasher to effectively clean the dishes without soap and water spots but otherwise the kitchen was very functional and well stocked with all the cooking items we needed.  We used the grill several times and it worked very well.  We have stayed at other homes in Sunriver in the past but 10 Camas Lane tops the list thus far.  We would gladly come back for another relaxing week at this home.

Our family of 4 enjoyed relaxing in the evenings after spending our days on Mt. Bachelor.  The hot tub was fantastic!  The kitchen was well stocked with glasses, dishes, bowls, pots and pans.  Everything we needed for cooking our meals.  The fire place was nice and the living room furniture was comfortable.  Easy access to the highway and Sunriver amenities made it a perfect location.  We have already recommended this home to our friends!

We had a great time here.  We had another house rented in Camas lane so it was nice that we had the 2 houses close together.  This house was comfortable enough to have everyone over for dinner and a game night one of the nights.  Plenty of room.  Nice to enjoy the hot tub after a day of being on the river.  I would stay here again.

Overall this house was a decent place to stay.  It is close to Fort Rock Park, which was great for our kids.  It was too much of a bike ride to SHARC and the village for our four year old, but easy for adults.  Hot tub was really nice!!! We didn't watch much television, but I hope they upgrade the tv and DVD selection in the main room for future stays.  Sunriver is an amazing place for families in the summertime.

Another great house-rental experience.  We'll look this place up again next time we come over.  Don't forget to visit Blondie's Pizza, the best place around.

We had a great experience at 10 Camas Lane.  Great location.  The Vacasa staff were very nice to allow us to stay a few extra hours past check-out due to the late hour of our departing flight - we appreciated the accommodation!  We look forward to our next visit to Sunriver.

This house was very clean, well stocked, and nicely maintained. Loved the hot tub! The only problem was the bunk bed was VERY squeaky and kids had to move the mattresses into the living room in order to sleep otherwise everyone could hear every time one of them moved at all. With a little WD-40 it would be fixable though. Overall it was an excellent deal and loved the house! Will definitely return!

We had a great time at 10 Camas in Sunriver.  The house had everything that we needed.  We loved having a washer/dryer and going home with clean clothes instead of dirty.  We didn't get to even take advantage of all that the house offered, like bikes and ping pong.  We did however, spend a lot of time at SHARC using the free unlimited passes.

This is my second year in a row staying here, and it's still the best value in all of Sunriver! I highly recommend it - beautiful, great location, air conditioning, bikes/ping pong/hot tub/pool and tennis passes, etc. Vacasa staff were awesome as always. Book here with confidence.

This home is great, especially for families. The bedrooms are nice- plenty of space. There were bikes available for everyone in our brood. My only complaint would be that the kitchen was not well stocked. I did have to cut a watermelon with a fillet knife- but we managed. Otherwise, fantastic place and would stay there again!!!

Slightly lower prices and individual customer service were good.  nice to be able to get in and out without dealing with large property manager office visit.  All in all, a good experience.

This property had a great selection of bikes, my youngest daughter loved riding the cool 3-wheel bike. The whole family played ping-pong out in the garage and soaked in the hot tub. The house had a great selection of some old videos.

Nicely located to the bike paths, village stores, and entry points off Hwy 97. Open single floor plan allowed family to interact more easily. Property managers were fantastic in responding to special requests for payment and extended stay. Will definitely consider this property and company for our annual ski trips to Sunriver.

Hot tub was great, new & nice size.  Loved the ping pong table and nice selection of bikes - all in good condition.  Would definitely rent again.

Overall our stay was great! The house is very well taken care of, clean, and organized. The bed in the second bedroom was a bit uncomfortable, but it did the job:)

We had a great Thanksgiving at 10 Camas in Sunriver, OR.  The house accommodated six adults and our 2 y/o Grandson nicely.  Enjoyed several bike rides even though it was a little chilly.  The house is perfect distance to Fort Rock Park.

very nice home with great open layout.  kitchen was very well stocked.  lots of amenities - ping pong table, bikes, video tapes.  great value compared to other properties.

I've vacationed in Sunriver over a dozen times, and this property was by far the best value of all the rentals I've stayed in. Spacious, lots of extras (bikes, pool passes, ping pong, bbq, a/c, etc) and all of the essentials you would need. I was amazed to fnd shampoo/conditioner in the bathrooms and laundry detergent (and stain remover!) for the washer. The hot tub was nice and the location was right next to fort rock park which was great for the kids. The Vacasa staff was very helpful as well. I will definitely be booking here in the future.

The house is in good condition and conveniently located in Sunriver. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this house.

Very well appointed home. The hot tub was wonderful. My son really enjoyed the 3 wheel bike. Wonderul stay just not long enough.

Overall,  very good experience. However, a few suggestions: please turn down the temp. on the water heater! Scalded too many times to count; rather dangerous w/ kids especially! Also, very helpful when I asked for more towels, but you really need to provide more than 4 bath towels to begin with. Also, more extra toilet paper is needed. Rationing squares at the end of our stay. The bunk bed in the small room was comfortable mattress-wise, but SO VERY squeaky when anyone moved or rolled over that it really interrupted sleep! Another system is really in order. Good kitchen set-up; lots of materials handy.

My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights and had a delightful time! There's a gas burning fireplace, TV's, a hot tub, and plenty if you're looking for a place to relax. We spent a lot of time in the house and would recommend it to anyone!

Every year we spend a summer and winter long weekend playing in and around Sunriver.  This year was no different.  Finding 10 Camas in a last minute search to secure this years spur of the moment trip was a life saver.  I spoke with Kimberly at the rental agency.  She was personable, polite, helpful and gave me the feeling that she was genuinely excited about us making the trip. (The kind of customer service that you wish you would find everywhere, the kind that makes you want to come back.)

The house layout was great, especially with 3 kids under the age 10.  No decks, balconies or lofts to fall from.  Lots of movies to choose from, though book selection was slim.  The hot tub was clean comfortable and private; making for a nice reprieve after a hard days work on the slopes of Mount Bachelor.

Despite having dated appliances and fixtures, the property was very clean and everything functional.  It provided as a very acceptable accommodation that we will keep on our list as a pla

Clean, neat spacious. Really very nice. Would stay again.

The house is in a great location and the setup is comfortable for a small group.    The house's potential could be achieved with additional kitchen items - like glasses and cookie sheets.  The pans should be replaced.  In addition, slightly better towels would have been nice.

The hot tub was turned off when we arrived.  The property manager had someone out immediately to look at it and get it started again, but we did lose a day of hot-tubbing while it heated up.

Overall, the house could be great with a few updates.

When we arrived at the house, the snow had not been removed from the driveway.  My twin girls got into the gargage and shoveled a pathway so we could move into the house.  We had to park at the entrance of the driveway.  We called and he sent someone out Thursday morning to clear the driveway.  We called him again on Thursday because we couldn't get onto the internet.  He called back to say that the owner had put a lock on it.  We were able to get the number.

Overall the place was very nice.  We enjoyed our stay.  We would go again to this home.  Thanks for helping us right away when we had the two problems.

This delightful three-bedroom Sunriver vacation home with a bonus sleeping nook has great architectural features like tall slanted ceilings and lots of windows for natural light, as well as a fully stocked kitchen, and all the amenities that Sunriver Resort has to offer - including eight SHARC passes! Spend some time here year-round, reconnecting on a family vacation that you'll always remember!

This comfortable, cozy interior will make everyone feel right at home whether you're gathered around the wall-mounted flat screen TV to watch a DVD, or playing a board game on the wooden coffee table. And on snowy evenings, there's no better place than snuggled up in front of the toasty warm gas fireplace, mugs of hot cocoa in hand.

In the large game room, you can play a game of pool, watch TV or pop a video into the VCR. There are a number of chairs for guests to relax or await their turn at the table. And on nice days, everyone can head out to the deck for a barbecue using the gas grill, enjoy a soak in the private hot tub, or just to socialize in the big, fully fenced yard. And since this home is dog friendly for one pet (with a $10 daily fee along with a $40 minimum per stay), your furry family member will have someplace safe to play and run around!

When it's time for meals, this Central Oregon vacation rental boasts a large, sunny kitchen, with a large dining table and stools at the breakfast bar. In the mornings, use the blender to make fruit smoothies for everyone, toast some toast, and grind some fresh beans for coffee. There's even a dishwasher to help you get cleaned up quickly, so that you can go back to having fun. And because the living room and kitchen share an open floor plan, no one will miss out on conversations while preparing meals or cleaning up!

The three bedrooms here are each decorated with an eye towards relaxation. In the master bedroom, you'll have a king sized bed, colorful striped bedding, an attached bath, and access to the deck - there's nothing like a soak in the hot tub before bed! The other two bedrooms have a queen bed and a set of twin-over-full bunk beds. The game room also has a sleeping nook with two twin beds, functioning almost like an extra bedroom that's perfect for kids! Altogether, up to eight guests can sleep comfortably here.

Other in-home amenities include a washer and dryer, stereo, and CD player. And if you need to keep in touch with work or just want to post your vacation pics so your friends will be jealous, this home also has WiFi.

This family friendly, high desert resort has everything you'll need for a relaxing, memorable family getaway! Visit the Sunriver Stables for a horseback tour of beautiful Central Oregon or a Victorian sleigh ride during the holidays, bring your skis and head to Mt. Bachelor Ski Area (for $20 roundtrip, there's a shuttle that leaves right from the Sunriver Lodge if you don't want to make the 30 minute drive yourself), or spend a snowy day snowshoeing on the resort's trails.

Sunriver also has a number of dining options right on site if you don't feel like cooking, and there's even more choices if you figure in The Village at Sunriver. There's Cafe Sintra for breakfast and lunch, Hot Lava Baking Co. for morning snacks and coffee, and Good 2 Go will even prepare a packed lunch for an afternoon hike or bike ride on one of the resort's 30 miles of paved trails. And for swimming in indoor and outdoor pools, more hot tubs, water slides, a tubing hill and more, don't forget to stop by the Sunriver Homeowners Aquatic & Recreation Center (SHARC) for family fun in the water!

This Sunriver vacation rental is just waiting to create memories for your adventure-packed Central Oregon getaway!

We planned this trip very last minute, it was very easy to book and we received all the necessary information very quickly and clearly. Great location! Located on a quiet street, very close to the highway, SHARC and The Village. No AC, but plenty of fans provided to stay cool. Overall, our family including our dog enjoyed the home and we would stay here again.

House layout was nice & pool table was a lot of fun.   Beds comfortable, house clean.  Kitchen well stocked with dishes & spices.  Better bring coffee filters or you will be forced to do paper towel brewing like we did.  :-(  Great quiet location with awesome bike paths.

The house is very nice and well located; although, if you want to be walking distance to the pool it is quite a walk.  It is quiet and close to freeway to visit Bend.  Bring some means to store food items as no tupperware or saran wrap etc. for that purpose.  If you don't have your own bikes there were bikes there which is ultra convenient for getting around Sunriver.  There is a small grocery nearby; it is actually walking distance!  The den/pool table is very nice and has two small beds so if you travel with kids it provides a separate spaces especially good for a teen to have their own space!  Pool table is truly a nice amenity!!! Overall a very comfortable place!

House was stocked and clean, it was exactly what we expected.   I would suggest bringing additional toilet paper.  Hot tub was great SHARC was awesome.  The house included passes which was amazing.  When one of the patio chairs broke I called to inform Vacasa and they were understanding  about it.

The hot tub and the pool table were a real hit with our grandchildren.  There were six of us and the home handled  us very well.  Thank you for a great time.

5 Dutchman is in a quiet area relative to other rentals in Sun River. It is further from the Sharc, but that is what we wanted. The house is well kept, clean, and in very good living order. Well stocked & comfortable. We would book here again. Make sure you get an itemized list of billing to avoid pricing discrepancies. It is a good value; however the extras add up & you should ask for a total price.

Nice house especially pet friendly with the fenced back yard.  Not quite as large as the pics suggest, but that's become a real estate standard.  Otherwise very comfortable in all ways.

Fenced yards are very rare in Sunriver - but this house has one! Such a bonus to let the dog out for a little while without worrying about her running away! Kitchen was in fact well-stocked with plenty of tools for cooking meals. Also loved the living room; large, cozy couch and gas fireplace. Will definitely stay here again!

We couldn't have asked for a better vacation rental experience. The house was furnished with everything we needed to cook, clean, and relax. It was also perfectly set up for all ages to enjoy time together and apart. There is so much to do in Sunriver and the surrounding area and this house was the ideal base camp to experience everything. Thank you so much, Vacasa!

The house and grounds were great.  Felt like home.

This home was perfect for our family.  The two master suites afforded a lot of privacy for two couples and had very nice beds and bathrooms. The other two bedrooms were great for the two kids.  The house was well stocked with paper items, soaps, propane, etc.  The living areas were great and were furnished nicely and were much more open than the pictures showed.  The patio with hot tub was very well designed for hot tub use as well as for outdoor cooking, eating, and enjoying the deer who visited.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

This four bedroom riverfront vacation home offers the best kind of Oregon getaway: modern luxury (chef's kitchen & TVs in every bedroom), rustic mountain ambiance (exposed timber beams and romantic fireplace) and easy access to a wealth of outdoor recreation (fly fishing, boating, mountain biking, and skiing, to name a few).

The home is tucked away on a private lane just a few miles south of the popular Sunriver Resort, close enough for a morning round of golf or evening at the brewery but far enough to enjoy plenty of peace and quiet at your own riverfront retreat with private dock.

At any time of year, you'll feel instantly at ease in the welcoming great room. Cathedral ceilings, warm hardwoods, and lush Oriental rugs provide the perfect setting for a cozy night by the fire or festive evening cooking dinner with friends. The living area has handsome leather sofas arranged before the wood-burning fireplace with convenient gas starter and the 42" flatscreen with DishTV cable and DVD player.

Just behind the cozy living area, the open kitchen with a barstool-lined island and elegant walnut dining table offer the perfect spot to prepare and share meals together. The kitchen has abundant granite countertops and professional-grade appliances, including a gas range, custom refrigerator, and all-important dishwasher for easy cleanup. In addition to all the basic dinnerware and cooking utensils, the gourmet in your group will appreciate the collection of quality All-Clad cookware and chef's knives.

Through the French doors, the covered wraparound deck has a gas grill so you can enjoy a barbecue even on less-than-sunny days. We suggest starting your mornings here with a mug of freshly brewed coffee, keeping your eyes peeled for the neighborhood wildlife that might wander past.

The home has been thoughtfully furnished to accommodate two families especially well, with a sleeper sofa-equipped family room and master suite downstairs, as well as two additional bedrooms upstairs. While the adults gather around the fireplace, younger guests can retire to the family room with its 36" flat screen television, and plenty of board games. The master suite has a king bed dressed in luxurious linens, attached bath with sunken jetted tub and his-and-her sinks, walk-in closet, and a private entrance to the outdoor deck.

Upstairs, the second bedroom is quite romantic in its own right with a queen bed and balcony overlooking the river. The third bedroom has two twin beds, and a large bath with tub/shower combo sits at the end of the hall. With a washer/dryer provided to keep up with laundry and a well-stocked linen closet, the home is very comfortable to share with up to eight guests. Wireless Internet access makes it easy to plan a working vacation or extended stays.

This part of Central Oregon is meant for adventure. Bring your boat: a ramp sits just a quarter mile downriver. Bring your rods & reels: the nearby Fall River is world-famous for fly fishing. Bring your clubs as your golf options are plentiful! But don't bring the canoes. This home has 2 canoes for guest use! And if you forget your mountain bikes, hiking maps, canoes, kayaks, or even horses, you'll be able to rent practically anything in nearby Sunriver. Wintertime, of course, brings skiing, snowshoeing and snowboarding galore at Mt. Bachelor (18 miles away) and any time of year is a great time to visit Bend (21 miles north) with its breweries, restaurants, shopping, and concerts. Bring your snowmobiles and enjoy them right from your backdoor.

Of course, if you find yourself spending all your time curled up by the fire with a good book from the homes collection, or kicking back on the sun-drenched deck with a glass of your favorite Oregon beverage, we won't tell. However you choose to spend your Central Oregon vacation, you'll love staying in laid-back luxury here on the Big Deschutes River.

I would stay here again.  Even though the weather didn't cooperate with a lot of outdoor activities we was looking forward to the place is just lovely, with access to dock and river front, most beds comfy, bathrooms nice, good linens and towels.  Had a really nice stay and hope it is available for our annual trip come next July!

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

Our family of five had plenty of room to relax and enjoy ourselves. The home is steps from the river and canoes are available to enjoy a paddle upstream. The hot tub in the back yard is a nice place to relax even though a few of the jets are not working. The home was clean, and stocked with everything you could need. Had two grills to cook on that we're located on a large wrap around deck. The exposed beams in the home are beautiful and sound system is very good, is iPod compatible. Board games are there to use and easy to assemble for games and meals at the large dining room table or even large coffee table by the wood burning fireplace. Plenty of firewood at the house for the fireplace. Bottom line, the whole family enjoyed and we will definitely book this property again if it is available when we return to Sunriver.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

The owners did a great job of creating a beautiful and peaceful space.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

From the pictures online I expected a more remote property.  I know now to check google earth prior to booking.  This was an average property with some nice summer time amenities.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

It's a large and beautiful house, and it feels well separated from the neighbors even though it's in a development. So, it's a good space. But in lots of little ways, the house didn't live up to expectations:

- Some rooms receive lots of heat, while others receive very little (including the main area and the master bath -- brrrr!).

- Despite the picture, you can't really see or hear the river from the house.

- The river is very low in the fall and winter, so the dock is sitting on a mud flat about 20 feet from the water.

- The hot tub isn't under a roof, so it isn't usable in all weather. And it *really* didn't look very appealing anyway.

- The fireplace hadn't been cleaned in too long, and the blower didn't circulate any heat.

- There were some repairs that hadn't been made (like a cabinet door missing) and the wi-fi didn't work. Entries in the guest book listed a lot of those kinds of little problems over time.

Maybe for a large family or group of friends, it would be an okay place to stay.

But for us, high nightly rate + high cleaning fee + hot tub fee (?!) = not worth it.

We've stayed in lots of rental houses over the years, including others near Bend -- there are better options out there.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

We loved our stay at this house and enjoyed the canoe rides, views of the river, and closeness to Bend without being inside Sunriver.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

This property was perfect for our girls getaway weekend. A beautiful house with plenty of space, plenty of privacy and an amazing private dock that was peaceful and perfect! We will definitely be returning to this house.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

We had an issue with our canoe.  I called and less then an hour later someone was there to take care of the issue.  Thank You.  Beautiful home and even more beautiful lot.  Deer every morning in our front and back yard.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

We had a blast!  The house, the location, the river, the porch and the weather were all spectacular. Highly recommend it and can't wait to go back.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

the place overall was nice and well equipped inside, the hot tub was disgusting, and the yard need to be maintained, peaceful and tranquil location.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

We were very unpleased that the hot tub, wifi and dishwasher did not work. We wanted to stay somewhere we've never been and  it sucked that the wifi and the hot tub did not work like it said was suppose to. Half the jets on the hot tub would not turn on. The wifi did not work at all! The dishwasher did not clean off leftover food and DVD player did not show image. Along with calling maintenance. They were not helpful at all and said they would come by the next day and they never showed up. The key to the gas fireplace was very confusing and seemed to not work and the grill wasn't scraped off from the previous guests. Would love to come back if all these things were fixed. The house was very beautiful and we didn't let these issues get us down. It just disappointed us very much.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

This house is absolutely gorgeous. The property is beautiful peaceful and very scenic. There were plenty of blankets and games, along with a beautiful indoor fireplace a wonderful hot tub outside. We wish we had stayed longer there were still many things to do there. it's absolutely stunning.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

We came here with a small group to snowboard bachelor for the weekend and it was perfect!  Had all the gadgets for cooking group dinners at night and a wood burning fireplace to warm up too!  The area was quiet and gorgeous!  We would definitely stay here again!

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

Very happy with the house and furnishings.  The kitchen needs a little help with all the cookware being filthy and the dishwasher being useless.  We ended up washing everything by hand. Loved the fire place  and the beds.

I would definitely stay there again, We had a great time. Everything that I mentioned was small compared to the amount of great memories that we will have from this trip.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

This was a very comfortable and nice home to stay in . I especially liked the general living area (kitchen, dinning, fireplace) where we could all commune together rather than be in separate living space apart from each other. It was nice to have a fire place with ample fire wood. We spent many fine moments together in front of the fire.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

We loved this spacious and attractive house.  It was well furnished and set in beautiful and peaceful surroundings.  We enjoyed watching the wildlife from the porch and from the dock by the river.  There is plenty to see and do in the surrounding area, plus good food and drink close by in Sunriver.  It was lovely to come back from a day out and sit on the porch and relax in the sun, listen to the breeze in the trees and drink wine.  Even though we had a couple of housekeeping issues when we first arrived, we would be happy to come back and would recommend this place as a great vacation location for couples or families.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

A wonderful place to get away, yet close enough to Bend for more action and outlet mall shopping if desired. Deer in the yard and hummingbirds await you at this home as well as goldfish in the fountain.  Our family had a wonderful time.  The kitchen has every imaginable appliance and the master bathroom with a jetted tub is magnificant.I would book this home again.

Riverfront With Hot Tub, WiFi and Private Dock with 2 Canoes

Fantastic location on the river.Peaceful and serene. Large  clean rooms and new appliances! We loved our big river vacation here! It was just close enough to Sunriver to get groceries and have some resort time but the best part was returning to our peaceful retreat AWAY from the hustle and bustle of Sunrivers traffic and many summer visitors! We loved playing on our own private dock and exploring the woods around the house. Otters, Beavers, Deer squirrels and more! Kids had a  fantastic time cathing tree frogs and riding bikes. We will return ! Thank You !

There are board games for an after-dinner tournament around the coffee table and plenty of space for everyone to find a spot for some quiet reading.

The outdoor deck has seating for all, so if it's a nice evening, you may even want to bring a mug of hot cocoa or a glass of after-dinner port outside. On summer evenings, fire up the gas grill for a burger feast or follow the pathway around to the private hot tub for a late evening soak. On clear nights, you can even do a little stargazing.

We stayed at 8 Cedar Lane in April 2015.  The house was wonderful; roomy, comfortable and clean.  The layout of the kitchen was open and eay to cook in.  Our kids loved the hot tub, pool table and foosball table (FYI - garage has a heater for use in the winter -- very nice!).  The availability of bikes was nice too.  However, if you have little kids, bring your own bikes.  The bikes that come with the house are not small enough for young kids (my 13 year old was okay to ride the ladies bike).  SHARC pool and rec center was a close bike ride, the outdoor pool facility looks like fun (not open during our visit).  I would highly suggest renting this home, we will definately stay here again in the future.

I loved staying at this house. It was perfect location and the house had all the amenities we wanted. Overall enjoyed my experience.

Overall great for our party of 8. Two bedrooms are on the ground floor which worked out well for the grandfather of our family given mobility issues. Two bedrooms upstairs as well. Water pressure in showers was exceptional! If you are planning on doing major cooking, bring your own pots/pans and certainly your own knives. Basic utensils provided. Located within walking distance to/from Fort Rock Park. Bikes were in good condition and a comfortable ride. Cozy feel of house and the wood-burning stove was a major hit.

Overall, this is a great place to stay!  Great location; close to the SHARC, but private and quiet.  We had a total of 4 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 small children and there was room for everyone.  We did have some problems with some of the plug-ins not working in the bathrooms, but I'm sure that will be addressed now that it has been brought to the attention of Vacasa.  Overall, it was a fun trip!

8 cedar lane is charming,  clean and  spacious. The hot tub is fantastic on a starry night. Kitchen is well stocked. Comfy beds and a great outdoor space.  Just note that it's quite  a long walk to the village. We will  be back!

While #8 Cedar has some issues, none of them were deal-breakers for us. The house is roomy and comfortable and can sleep 8 people with no problem. The huge deck is wonderful for relaxing and reading and the hot tub is great for soaking on a crisp evening (even though the jets weren't working on our visit).  The loft allowed our sports-loving contingent to watch TV while the rest of us enjoyed music or quiet down below. The beds were all very comfortable and the linens and towels were nice quality. If you are planning to do any serious cooking, I suggest bringing sharp knives.

This rustically elegant three-bedroom Sunriver vacation home has it all - great resort amenities, a whimsical, outdoorsy style, a private hot tub out on the deck, and luxurious touches like a soaking tub in the bathroom and a gourmet kitchen.

The big and open living room features cozy touches like plush carpeting, warm leather furniture, an entertainment center with a flat screen TV, DVD, and Blu-Ray player. Pick a new favorite flick from the DVD library, and relax with a movie by the flickering gas fireplace after a long day of exploring the resort! If you haven't had your fill of fresh air, step out through the sliding glass doors out onto a scenic deck and relax outside near the trees.

But, really, your favorite gathering place may just be the large, open, and bright kitchen and dining room! From the tall, slanted ceilings and wood floors, to the artistic, glass tiles on the backsplash, this is a great room! Chop vegetables at the kitchen island, and grind fresh coffee beans in the morning, there's even a dishwasher to help clean up after the meal. And gathering everyone around for dinner should be no problem here. The large wooden table, under the antler chandelier is the ideal spot for family meals, reading a paper in the morning, or even setting up your laptop to check email with this home's WiFi.

Out on the large deck, you'll have a private hot tub for a relaxing soak after a day out exploring some of Sunriver's 35 miles of paved biking and hiking trails. Out here, there's also a gas grill, so grab some steaks and some beer, and you can grill up a feast.

The master suite has a wood post bed frame, king sized bed, deck access, and a large soaking tub. Come back to your peaceful space in the morning and have coffee on the deck, back in bed, or even in the soaking tub. The other two cozy rooms each have a queen bed and comfortable, colorful bedding.

This was the perfect house to bring my 83 year old father and his sweetheart.  He walks with a cane and the house was easy for him to get around in and the walk-in showers were perfect.  All the comforts of home in a beautiful natural setting.  We really enjoyed the deck, the lounge chairs and umbrellas made it a great place to spend the afternoons. We enjoyed watching dog walkers, bicyclists and children strolling on the path, while chipmunks, birds and deer ! made themselves at home in the woods. The house was very clean, very well maintained and very comfortable.  Our every need/want was met and we plan on staying here again.

Had everything we needed and if it didn't they brought it.

Immaculate, private, quiet, comfortable beds, kitchen well equipped - loved every minute and the house was more than adequate. Would definitely come back.

The home has very nice furnishings on the inside and is very cozy and comfortable. We loved the leather couches. It was perfect for two couples, but could easily handle a third. There is only one master suite, but a hallway bath for the other two bedrooms. Just remember to stagger your showers if all six plan on having hot water.

They have coffee beans and powdered creamer for us that was an unexpected perk!

Unassuming from the outside but outstanding on the inside.  Very comfortable and cozy.  Has everything you could ask for (could use a full size ironing board and a patio table) and it would be perfect.

I desperately want to give this place a 5+ star rating!!! Overall it is an outstanding home to vacation in. It was perfect for our family of 4 (2 teens) and would work great for 3 couples as well. We were only disappointed that there wasn't deck furniture on the huge, beautiful deck overlooking the trees and bike path in the 70+ degree weather. There is also no access to the garage which we weren't expecting. Not a big deal, but an inconvenience with sleds, bikes, etc. But, let's not dwell there... It is beautifully furnished with high quality touches throughout. Wonderful hot tub outside the Master bedroom on the spacious deck. The kitchen had everything we needed and the entire home was REMARKABLY clean. It comes with SHARC passes, family board games, wifi and  very nice TV's both in the living room and master bedroom. The home is quiet, beds are comfortable, and we just didn't want to leave. EVER:) Great vacation space at an affordable price. Highly recommend!!!

The house was beautiful and perfect for our family. The kids loved the bunk beds & the wii! The kitchen had all the necessities we could ever think of. The bedrooms were simply perfect. I love everything about this house. Perfect location as well! Will definitely come back & I highly recommend this property.

Perfect size for 3 couples with kids.  Kitchen is very well appointed and house stays very warm in the winter time.

4 couples stayed in this home while in the area for a work conference - it was ideal with the  multiple bedrooms and three full baths and the lovely deck had a great view for us to watch the lightning storms.  Large kitchen with a bar sink made entertaining a breeze with a large group, and the patio table was plenty big as well.

While we didn't have time to use them this trip, the garage had two kayaks available and plenty of room to store our golf clubs.

Thanks!

7 Shadow home is beautiful! Well equiped and very clean.

Fabulous home. Make sure to grab a pizza from Blondies in the Village. Best pizza ever!

Overall great house!! Very spacious and fully stocked. Plenty of room for two families!! We noticed a couple marist high school items!! Three out of four adults are from eugene with one marist grad!!  We will definitely stay here again...but hh ope the master mistress is replaced!! Thanks for sharing your home.

The house was great! Vacasa was really, really convenient. The kids room was well stocked with guitar hero etc, hottub was clean & hot (sometimes got too hot with the lid on), kitchen was really well stocked with everything we could need. Only negatives: one room downstairs did not seem to heat up like the rest of the house, & some glasses were chipped/broken.

One bedroom loft with private hot tub, close to town!

This bright one-bedroom Bend vacation rental is a great home base for two while exploring this bustling Central Oregon town. This second story loft (please note, there's no elevator) is just west of downtown, in a quiet neighborhood near Sunset View Park and the the West Bend Trail. The enclosed back patio offers a hot tub for two to relax in at the end of your day.

In this smartly decorated space, you'll have a cozy gas fireplace, comfortable plush furniture, and lovely park views right out the windows.

The bedroom has a comfortable king sized bed, a closet for storage, a writing desk, and a ceiling fan, while the full bathroom has a shower/tub combo. This retreat is located above the garage of a larger home where the owners make their full-time residence, but you'll find plenty of space to comfortably sleep two guests. The home is just perfect for a quick weekend getaway or an extended retreat to visit all of Bend's breweries, galleries, and outdoor attractions.

On nice days, you can walk through the west side neighborhoods and across the Deschutes River to Drake Park and downtown (this Bend vacation rental is just less than 2 miles from the heart of downtown). Feed the ducks and geese, or walk on to breweries like Boneyard, Deschutes, 10 Barrel, and Goodlife Brewing Company. Follow your own path or use the Bend Ale Trail map to make sure you hit all 11 breweries in town. Or, rent some bikes and explore the cycle-friendly town on two wheels.

There's also galleries and restaurants downtown to visit, or just sit outside one of the many coffee houses and people-watch. Right in your own neighborhood, there's a handful of restaurants to choose from, including Thai Thai Restaurant for pumpkin curry or Porttelo Wine Cafe for happy hour. And if you cast a wider net to include downtown, you'll have dozens of restaurants to choose from.

In winter, this loft is only a 30 minute drive from Mt. Bachelor for some of the best skiing and snowboarding in Oregon. Other cold weather options include a snowshoe tour of the Deschutes National Forest, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing. Year-round, there's the shops at the Old Mill District, the High Desert Museum, or you could take a culinary tour of Bend's unique food and wine establishments.

Whenever you choose to stay at this Bend vacation rental you're sure to have a number of options!

We enjoyed a few days exploring the Bend area and calling this apartment home.  The bed was very comfortable and the apartment had everything we needed. It was great to have the locked garage for our bikes. Thanks for a great stay!

It was my girlfriend's birthday and she just got into mountain biking 4 months ago. She's been progressing but I needed a place we could go that wouldn't be too gnarly. After some research Bend was the clear choice. I found this place online, price was right, location is really close to Phil's and it has a garage for bike storage. Perfect for those who like to play hard but don't want to sacrifice comfort. We didn't do any cooking but everything is there, including a grill. Hot tub was a nice treat to come home to after riding. Bend has tons of great dining options so you don't have to give up the finer things to go on an 'outdoorsy' trip. Would highly recommend this spot, much better than a hotel and probably the same price.

This place is perfect for a couple to get out of town and enjoy a romantic getaway. The property felt very private even while being attached to someone's home. The hot tub is a fabulous touch that truly enhances the experience. Bed was cozy and all the basics were provided. This home is just a short 9 minute drive from downtown with plenty to do if your looking for a short weekend getaway or even a longer stay. Very highly recommended!

Bend is such a wonderful playground!  Great activities followed by delicious craft beers!  This property is located in a quiet neighborhood with lots of green space.  So nice to not listen to traffic at night.  A real treat.

This was an amazing place to stay. Perfect for 2 people!  It wasn't far at all from downtown and the neighborhood was lovely.  We loved how the neighborhood didn't have a lot of street lights and we were able to see the stars.  The hot tub was amazing, too.  It was really great and highly recommend it!

We loved our time in this rental. The studio is good size and you get your own garage. That was perfect as we had bikes with us. The location is great-close to NW Crossing, downtown and Old Mill. FYI the rental has an iron and blow dryer(wondered that and packed my own-not needed!)

A cosy place!  We enjoyed being able to grill.  Also, the AC worked well and quickly once we figured it out.  We had never seen this type of AC unit before.

Quiet neighborhood. Easy access to biking trails, food and breweries on Galveston St.  Very clean and nice rental.  Privacy from owners with exception of loud children screaming under bedroom window  early in morning. :).  Otherwise pleasant.

We picked this place for it's location near a large network of mountain biking trails, and for the two person hot tub on the private deck.  We never saw or heard the owners (just the way we like it), and we had a garage where we could secure our mountain bikes over night.  The apartment itself was very clean and neat, with comfortable furnishings.  We also used the grill and kitchen, which were well stocked with pans, plates, glasses and utensils (except you may want to bring steak knives if you plan more than one person eating meat at a time).  Any time we plan on coming back to Bend, we will be staying  here again.

When booking this property I didn't realize that we were so far from town.  I thought we could have walked into town.  If being out in the suburbs and approx. 10 step flight of stairs up to the condo then this is a compfortable  condo for you.

Came here to celebrate our 25th anniversary. Perfect place to relax and close to all the Bend attractions we love.

Quiet easy to find location, accessible to west side amenities and Phil's trails. Perfect for a couple. Liked the garage for ski and bike storage.

We were delighted with the property as it had everything we could ask for, for s few night's stay! One thing I could recommend to the property owners is additional mirrors for getting ready. Since there is only one bathroom, my fiancÃ© and I had to take turns getting ready. Otherwise, it was a perfect location, very welcoming and clean, and the hot tub was amazing! Thank you again for a great stay!

We arrived after a bittersweet day to find the home completely prepared for us! Music playing on the TV, a wonderful smell, freshly vacuumed carpets, everything was perfectly prepared! The hot tub was great and at a comfortable temperature! We didn't use the grill, but it was awesome having that as an option! Loved our experience and will definitely be back!

clean and well located for downtown shopping and hiking trails. perfect for 2 people.

The property was very clean and comfortable.  Great area with lots to do.

Were very pleased with this townhome- quiet neighbors, lovely places to walk our dog, and very convienient without being right in the middle of town.   Will sure seek out this place for a return trip :)

Some very nice touches  for a vacation rental: - laundry detergent; spare key is separate lock box; condiments in the refrigerator.  Quiet and comfortable, a very relaxing stay and perfect for two.

With Mt. Bachelor just twenty minutes away, the Deschutes River winding past, and a slew of award-winning restaurants and breweries to visit, Bend has become a popular Central Oregon destination for very good reason. And whether you seek a cozy cabin for two or a spacious retreat for a family reunion, we have the perfect Bend vacation rental for your next getaway! Bend offers all of the highlights of the Pacific Northwest (outdoor recreation, amazing beer, locally-sourced cuisine), plus 300 days of sunshine for a true year-round destination. Of course, many visitors come to explore Mt. Bachelor: skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing in the winter, with amazing mountain biking and hiking trails in the late summer. The Deschutes River winds through the city, offering a beautiful riverside trail for biking and jogging in the summer, and snowshoeing in the winter. Get to know the river a little better by kayak, or book a guided trip on a whitewater raft or with a fly-fishing pole in hand. For even more adventure, try your hand at rock climbing, or head underground on a caving expedition. There are numerous golf courses to choose from, and miles of trails of varying difficulty to keep all cyclists happy. All that exercise works up quite an appetite, and Bend is ready for you! Your options range from fine-dining to homespun cafes, but you might pass them all by in favor of the wonderful brewpubs that have sprung up over the last decade. The city even offers an atlas and passport as you explore the Bend Ale Trail. The downtown area and the Old Mill District, a former industrial zone turned entertainment area, are prime destinations for shoppers and dining. If you feel like exploring a bit, the nearby town of Sisters is only 20 miles north. Home of the Annual Sisters Rodeo in June, this nearby town has a real Western vibe with shops, galleries and restaurants. Staying in a Bend vacation home is a wonderful way to experience this unique city. Sip your morning coffee on your cozy front porch, or stroll downtown to a local cafe for a cappuccino. Stock up on the freshest, most local groceries at the seasonal farmers' market, and enjoy Oregon's bounty in the comfort of your own kitchen. Several of our vacation rentals have cozy fireplaces for chilly winter nights, and a few offer pet-friendly accommodations for a very dog-friendly town. Whether your plans take you to the top of Mt. Bachelor or just to the brewery around the corner, you'll thoroughly enjoy coming back to your cozy Bend vacation rental.

Come and enjoy this resort while you relax in this truly special Black Butte Ranch vacation home surrounded by towering Ponderosa pines. The wood beams, vaulted ceiling and walls of windows make the living and adjoining dining areas feel very spacious and offer a wonderful gathering spot for all your fellow travelers!

Black Butte Ranch is set 32 miles away from Bend, and about nine miles from Sisters.

Handsome sofas and armchairs sit before the wood-burning fireplace and the wall of soaring windows, making this the perfect place to curl up on chilly winter evenings or watch wildlife wander past on early spring mornings. There is a TV with basic cable and DVD player for movie nights, along with an extensive library of films to choose from. This home even has a lovely piano if you want to host an old-fashioned singalong!

The open kitchen makes this an entertainer's dream. Overlooking the living and dining areas and outfitted with stainless steel appliances, the home has everything you might need to prepare meals for all your guests: oven with stovetop, refrigerator with ice maker, microwave, coffeemaker, toaster, slow cooker, pots and pans, dinnerware, glasses, serving utensils, and, of course, a dishwasher! Skylights overhead flood the space with sunshine, but when it's warm enough, you can even step out the sliding glass doors to the huge wraparound deck for a barbecue around the gas grill.

The open kitchen has a good sized eating bar with two chairs so your friends can converse with the chef while they are working, or set the six-person dining table for a more formal meal.

With three bedrooms and two full baths, up to six guests can very comfortably share the space. The main floor master suite has a king size bed, a door to the deck and a private bath with tub/shower combination and double sinks. The second bedroom has a queen size bed and shares the hall bath with its walk-in shower. The third bedroom has two twin beds, and each bedroom offer ample closet space and dressers so you can unpack and relax. With warm wood accent walls, each space feels delightfully cozy with just a touch of rustic style.

The home offers access to all of the Black Butte Ranch recreation facilities! You'll enjoy the four pools, two golf courses, tennis, stables, biking and walking trails, state of the art spa and wonderful restaurants. The views from the main lodge are unmatched, looking out to the Cascade Mountain Range and over the lake, where you can even rent a canoe for an afternoon paddle! Complimentary WiFi is offered at the lodge and recreation facilities if you must stay connected to the office or check your email periodically.

The charming town of Sisters is just twenty minutes away, and the picturesque Metolius River and town of Camp Sherman are just across from the ranch entrance. A visit to the Camp Sherman store and fish hatchery is always a fun trip, as is a hike up to the ranger station on top of Black Butte.

Whether you are here to relax by the pool or to explore the great outdoors, you will love to call this Central Oregon vacation rental your home away from home!

*In order to access the recreational facilities, there is a fee of $6 per day for every guest above 8 years old. Please be aware that this fee will be collected by the resort at check-in. Also, please note that motorcycles are not permitted within the ranch or on any of the Black Butte properties.*

Very nice house.  Roomy with  a nice open floor plan.

Bedrooms were nice and will be greatly improved with some new beds - which were a little on the "worn out" side.   But all in all Black Butte is a really nice place that we have stayed at multiple times.  Every house we've rented there has been very nice.

A super condo in a spectacular location!  All the bells and whistles for a relaxing vacation. The condo is beautiful and overlooks the river.  We walked out the front door to hiking and biking and kayaking.  Restaurants and shop are a ten minute stroll away. Mt Bachelor is only  a twenty minute drive.  We could not have picked a better spot for a relaxing fun filled vacation.

We really lucked out finding this property.  It is in a great location and has very good amenities. The Old Mill Historical district is an easy walk and there are many activities along the river. Very well decorated and perfect for a relaxing vacation. I would highly recommend to anyone. The only caveat would be potential renters that have problems climbing up and down stairs. There are 2 long staircases.

Nicely updated unit with nice amenities. Great access to downtown as well as access to the river and hiking trails!

We really enjoyed our stay at this condo. It is beautiful inside and is on a nice property. We hope to stay again!

A very good location close enough to downtown to be walkable and near a lovely walk along the river.

This location is directly adjacent to one of Bend's many riverfront parks with extensive walking paths in both directions.  It is also an easy walk to Wall Street and downtown Bend.

This condo was perfectly situated for ease to walk downtown for all the brewery tours and shopping you would want to do but easy enough to shoot out of town for hikes and seeing central Oregon's beauty.

While we were there we encountered a leaky ceiling which needed repairs and the Vacasa staff was great in relocating us to an identical condo next door. They obviously care about the condition of their properties and quality of the stay for their guests. Despite this little inconvenience, which happens, it really ended up being not very inconvenient. Overall would definitely stay here again.

This was perfect for a nice get away, and we were able to bring or little four legged friend with us. Easy to find and it felt like home. Very clean and had everything we needed, the location was great for walking downtown to the shops and restaurants.

I'm thinking there were not a lot of exterior shots due to the lack of charm.  Maybe show more.  I know now to think twice if the outside is not well represented. Location was handy and the inside was nice.

This condo is great: super affordable, modern, clean, great location.  I cooked in the kitchen daily, it had all the supplies I needed.  This place is a great deal!

Next to a beautiful park and trail.  Close to downtown, quiet very well maintained.

While the property seems a bit odd from the outside (part vacation rental/part residential), the condo itself was clean, comfortable and well-furnished.  Could easily have stayed for longer, making our own meals, etc.

The location is just barely on the edge of downtown, making it an easy walk in.  All in all, far better than expected for the price.  We'll be back!

For a sunny Central Oregon vacation rental, the charm and convenience of this lovely condo can't be beat!

Unit itself is spacious and clean, updated appliances, comfortable king bed. Located a few blocks from downtown and a short drive to the old mill district.

Nice apt. Spacious, view is mostly of the building next door.

My partner and I spent a nice long weekend here, and this place was perfect.  So nice to have two bathrooms with showers, a full kitchen with lots of appliances (just be sure to bring your own cooking spices, measuring cups/spoons, and oil), and a beautiful bedroom with comfortable king sized bed.  We enjoyed playing games on the raised bar table in the kitchen, and reading on the couch.  The TV and fireplace are great - just wish they had a DVD player.  But we enjoyed the beautiful weather and outdoors.  So nice to be able to walk to downtown from this property, and didn't even realize it was a gated community.  Neighbors were not loud.  (You could hear footsteps and showers above, but it wasn't overwhelming).  We'd love to come back here again with friends.

First off, the pros:

-Great location â€“ Really close to the beautiful Bend river trail. You can walk north along the wild/scenic section of the trail or south into Downtown Bend.

-Well maintained hot tub and pool area. It is an older facility but the hot tub and pool area were clean.

-Remodeled Interior â€“ Pretty flooring, kitchen design, etc. 2 bathroom is nice if you have a larger group.

-Vacasa seems responsive to complaints as they sent out their on-call manager to speak to the HOA about the neighbors staying up until 3am. I canâ€™t say whether this helped as our neighbors were not around the next night.

The cons:

Uh oh. This is going to be a long list. Let me preface this by saying that by my wife and I are usually pretty easy-going travelers with pretty moderate expectations. However, we expect at bit more when we are paying $175 a night for a non-holiday weekend and renting a place managed by a professional management company (Vacasa).

-The bed â€“ Worst bed I have EVER slept on. The mattress literally slopes from the center out and, unless you sleep right in the middle of the bed, it feels as if you are going to roll off of the bed. It was really uncomfortable and made it impossible to get decent rest.

-Obnoxious Neighbors â€“ on Friday night, our neighbors stayed up until 3am drinking, yelling, playing games, and talking very loudly on their balcony. The balcony is about 10 feet away from the head of the bedâ€¦ Furthermore, the living space for the condo next door shares a wall with your bedroom. We found out (after complaining to Vacasa about being kept up until 3am) that these neighbors are long-term residents who live in the condo complex.

-Pet friendly?! Not so much. It was pretty awkward when we arrived (after paying Vacasa a $46 pet fee to bring 2 well-behaved dogs for 2 nights) to see a large sign in bold, red lettering on the outside of our condo building that read, â€œNO PETS ALLOWED.â€ We entered our unit and began reading the â€œWelcomeâ€ booklet left by Vacasa to see in the â€œAbout this Unitâ€ section a statement about how no pets are allowed in this particular unit. Vacasa later told me that they are on a 1-year trial period with the condo complex which allows Vacasa units only to have pets but pets are still not technically permitted anywhere on the premises other than in the Vacasa units.

-Old and run down complex â€“ Like I said, we have pretty low expectations as we are generally just looking for a place to sleep and spend most of our time outside of our vacation rental. However, for $175 a night, this place is not very nice. You are right near the major highway and this particular unit is an end-unit near a major road with a window that only looks onto the side of a big, ugly condo building less than 15â€™ away. You have no view of the river or even the grounds or, for that matter, even a parking lot.

The location is close to downtown and parks--very central and easy to navigate.  This unit has two porches--but both have absolutely no view--they look at the back of another building only feet away.  The pool and hot tub in the complex had problems--pool was unheated (indoor) and the jets in the hot tub did not work.  The TV in the unit also did not function until we were instructed to disconnect the power to the cable service, wait, and then reconnect--each time we wanted to use it.  Also-there was no reading light on one side of the bed.

Location is great, convenient to both downtown and highway. Property is very clean, has everything we needed.

Location is great, convenient to both downtown and highway. Property is very clean, has everything we needed.

It was an easy walk down to the river at Pioneer Park and the walk downtown was pleasant as well!  The remodel was tastefully done and it felt like a modern building.  I am looking forward to many more trips to Bend and staying at one of these condos again!

Sisters Coffee Company on Hood Avenue features a homey, Old West feel and will fuel everyone up for the morning's game plan.

Large picture windows give you a great view of the wooded yard for spotting wildlife even while you enjoy a movie.

Just off the family room, a glass door leads to a spacious wrap-around deck, complete with a gas BBQ and patio furniture. It's an ideal place to grill steaks and relax at the end of the day!

Rounding out the main floor is the master bedroom with queen size bed and large bathroom with a sunken tub. End the day in style by soaking with a glass of fine Oregon wine in the bubbles. Upstairs, a large bedroom with tall ceilings awaits with another queen bed and a balcony to survey the one and a third acres of tree-lined property and enjoy a mug of morning coffee. A Jack-and-Jill bath separates an adjoining bedroom with two sets of bunk beds. In total, the three bedrooms and two and a half baths accommodate eight guests quite comfortably, making this house perfect for two couples with children traveling together.

Favorite day trips in the area include a hike up Black Butte to the ranger station or a trip to Camp Sherman and the Metolius River Hiking Trail and Fish Hatchery. Head to nearby Phalarope Lake for fly fishing, kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding, and canoeing. There's so much to do you'll never want to leave!

The place worked especially well for our group of 7 which included 4 adults and 3 children.  There are a lot of winter and summer activities for the children without having to go any where.  You can ski, sled, and swim right there at Black Butte.  The house had numerous games for the kids but they spent most of their time playing hide-n-seek in the big house.  There's lots of space to spread our with both the family room and the living room plus lots of bathrooms.  The kitchen has everything you will need for the basics.  The town of Sisters is close by so you can shop or eat out at a restaurant.  Also, the kids loved the big swimming pool with the slide.  Everyone had a great time.  The place was beautiful and neighbors far enough away not to bother you.  Loved this place!

Wonderful place for our family of 6 to stay.  Plenty of room and the house is laid out very well.  The 4 bikes came in very handy.  Some parts of the house, like the bathrooms could use some updating, but the place was very clean.  The property is toward the edge of Glaze Meadow, so bike riding to the main lodge is quite a haul, but close enough to the Glaze Meadow pool.

Located next to park so pet had great walks even tho' weather was extroinarly hot.

Better WiFi and more than 2 pillows.  That's all we have.  Other than that it was a great experience.  Thank You.

This place was amazing! We booked it at 7:15pm and were in the condo in 15 minutes!  It had everything we needed and it was quiet and perfect in every way.  I couldn't believe how nice it was. Friends in Bend said it wasn't possible to get a great place for less than $100 per night, but the were WRONG!!

1 minute walk to the river/ beautiful park, 5 minute walk to all the downtown restaurants and bars, extremely close to hwys. Perfect location and I would/will definitely stay here again. Also, it has A/C and it was a very hot long weekend.

Upon arrival there were only 4 towels for 3 people and 5 days. There is apparently no extra comforters for any of the rooms so when my daughter got sick and threw up we were blanket less for 2 nights. When someone broke glass in front of our door it was not cleaned for 3 days. We called vacasa probably 5 or 6 times during our stay and the staff on the phone were very nice but the end result was that we had to call 2x to get a new comforter, 2 x until they picked up the glass and there wasn't enough towels even after they brought us extra. Beautiful room, nice pool great location but if your traveling as a family I would recommend a location with a bit more service. When I have stayed at vacation rentals in the past there were a plethora of towels, sheets, blankets esp for a long stay so maybe I was just spoiled before?

We really appreciated being notified of being able to check in early! It made the start to our trip go smoother so we could get settled and go explore the area. The directions and instructions were also very good and made things easy.

We booked this place last minute and didn't expect much. It was a pleasant surprise how clean and comfortable it was. Always plenty of parking and the housekeeping lady was very friendly. The laundry room was convenient too. Much better than staying at a hotel b/c you have a kitchen. One small problem was the wifi. Our kids have iPads and the slow wifi, when working, caused complaints.

The skylight our condo had very good amenities very clean and nicely remodeled. The problem was there was no direct access to Wi-Fi inside the apartment. This caused problems as I needed to do work. The fireplace and the amenities in the condo were great

Just minutes from downtown, and right next to the Deschutes River. Beautiful modern design inside an older condo complex. Back alley area didn't feel very safe at night due to poor lighting. Loved the king size bed, the grill, the two bathrooms, and the air conditioning!

We loved the location and being able to walk to downtown.  The condo itself was also really  awesome.  It seemed to be recently remodeled with a lot of attention to details! All the furnishings in the condo are really high quality and comfortable, especially the big king bed! The fireplace was a great addition and made the condo really cozy.  The balcony is also really great and although we didn't grill, we will definitely plan to stay again and take advantage of the big BBQ!

These condos are great. You can walk or bike around town. Fun to plan with a group or alone.

A great place to stay!  Kitchen was well stocked with pots/pans/etc.  Very comfy king bed! Love the park next door!

Best part of this experience was the super comfy king bed! Weather was hot but sitting out on the patio was great with a nice breeze & view of Pioneer Park in full green out!

The Deschuttes River runs right behind the complex and there is a lovely river walking trail. It is convenient to downtown. The Jacuzzi is nice.

we had a fantastic time at this condo. We would definitely rent again.

Great location and easy access to highway and Mt Bachelor. Nice spacious condo!

Everything was good. Good value for the price. But bottom floor unit with noisy upstairs is a pet peeve of mine.

Great location, nice rooms - very clean. Loved our stay, will be back soon.

My husband and I came here for our 5th wedding anniversary. We weren't sure what to expect but were please with what we arrived to. Older condo, could use so updates but overall nice. Bed was very comfortable which was all that mattered really since we were hardly in the condo. It is on a beautiful riverfront park and is walking distance to downtown bend which was a huge plus for us since we went for the beer and didn't have to drive. If you are looking for a cozy condo, nothing fancy, but nice place to stay in bend at a great price, stay here!

A trip to Bend in Central Oregon will have you enjoying the authentic charm of this Old Mill vacation home, perched above the Old Mill District with mountain views. You'll be within easy walking distance to all the shops, restaurants, and theaters in the Old Mill district and downtown Bend is less than two miles away by car or bike.

This comfortable home offers a state-of-the-art sound system, as well as high speed WiFi throughout. The TV offers cable channels, but it's a new smart TV that allows you to access Amazon Prime for videos or Pandora accounts, too.

In the living room, sit back on the stylish, bright turquoise sofas while you watch a movie or your favorite TV shows. And if you get chilly, the gas fireplace with blower warms the living room, adjoining kitchen and dining area easily.

When it's time to prepare meals, the kitchen is equipped with everything including the basic spices to prepare a simple breakfast or a gourmet dinner. If you're walking around downtown Bend, pick up some beans at one of our many outstanding local roasters to come back and grind at the house.

When it's time for bed, you'll have your choice of four well-appointed bedrooms. Two of the bedrooms each have a queen bed, and there's a beautiful master suite with a king sized bed and a sofa trundle for extra seating or sleeping. A nearby den has two sets of twin bunk beds to sleep the extra little ones. The home also has a lovely tuned piano for added entertainment. This home will comfortably sleep ten guests (twelve if you use the sofa trundle in the master.)

In the evenings, step out to the large landscaped yard. It's a wonderful place to enjoy an evening mug of tea or glass of wine on the patio.

Although the home backs Bend's new parkway, you'd never know that once you're inside. The private cul-de-sac location is ideally situated to conveniently explore all that the greater Bend area has to offer. Additionally, there is a new wheelchair ramp to the front door if needed (and although a wonderful asset for those in need, it's not to ADA standards due to the slope and lack of a few feet in distance.) Other amenities include a stereo, CD player, and a washer and dryer for guest use.

When you're ready to explore the area, you'll find outdoor adventures left and right. There's white water rafting on the Deschutes River and great hiking in the nearby national forest lands, as well as mountain biking and rock climbing opportunities nearby.

In winter, Mt. Bachelor is only a 30 minute drive away for skiing, snow boarding, and snowshoeing. Year-round, the shops of the Old Mill District are only a 10 minute stroll away. A quick ride into downtown will reveal even more shopping and dining opportunities, include a number of local breweries for a fun afternoon of beer tasting.

For a great Central Oregon vacation, Bend has a lot to offer and everyone will enjoy staying at this wonderful and charming vacation home!

We really enjoyed our stay at the house. It had everything we needed, including lots of condiments in the fridge. The music playing as we entered the house was a nice touch. The fire pit was great and we used it one evening. Our only issue was with the dishwasher. It needs to be replaced. One of the wheels fell off the bottom rack and the top rack comes off really easily and almost caused a big mess when it came off of its track and almost fell on the floor with a rack full of glasses. Other than that, we loved the house and the location. We would stay again!

We have an annual golf trip that we take to bend. We're always staying in hotels and timeshares and have never found the perfect place. However our stay here was absolutely perfect due to this little house.  The house was clean and well stocked. We will be back next year

My friends and I had a wonderful stay here during the Bend Marathon weekend. The booking process was super easy and convenient. I can't speak for their customer service because everything was perfect, so I never needed to call or email anybody.

The house was clean and extremely well-outfitted. We cooked a big meal the day before the race, and I wanted for absolutely nothing in that amazing kitchen. I love the curved walls and little details of the home - it reminded me a little of a Hobbit House (with tall ceilings). The living room is a great place to gather: I loved the fireplace, piano, comfy couches, and giant TV. I would just note that the bunk room is definitely a kids room. I don't really know any adults who should expect a bunk bed to provide an exceptional night sleep, so be realistic with your expectations there. I slept fine, but I'm a tiny person. If you are 6ft tall and weigh 200lbs - stick with the king or queen beds and you'll sleep well.

The location is awesome - super convenient to downtown, but in a nice, quiet cul-du-sac. This is definitely a great place for a quiet retreat. I only wish we'd had time to enjoy the outside firepit.

Thanks for giving us such a nice home base to prepare for our race! Four of us ran and finished the half with great times. We'll be back!

We were happy with our stay.  We had 4 kids with us from 7yrs to 1 month old. We had everything we needed, space indoor, space outside to play and a seperate room for the kids. backyard  was fenced but not all the way around so someone needed to be with the kids at all times...if you are a over protective mom like me.  The kitchen had more small appliances than I have in my own home! Didn't pack my Hairdryer so I was happy to see the house had two.

Very short drive to old mill district, probably could ride our bikes there but not with my young kids and being next to a busy road.

The house was packed with anything you need or forgot,...laundry soap, hairdryer, oils for cooking, spices, condiments in the fridge, shampoo/ conditioner and soap stocked up in dispensers in every shower, tons of bath towels, well stocked junk drawer ( needed a screwdriver and wouldn't you know... They had one).

We had six friends stay at the property for a bachelorette weekend, and it was perfect! We loved the fire outside, the great outdoor space, and the beautiful house! We were so happy and would love to come back! Thank you so much for providing a great place for our celebration!

This was an amazing home! Not only did it sleep all of us comfortably, but it had everything we needed, from a pizza cutter to a tortilla warmer. The house was in immaculate condition when we arrived an even had music playing on the stereo. The fire place on the back patio was a wonderful! It was a nice place to unwind after the day. i had a couple of questions through out our stay and the staff was very friendly and answered everything I asked. Stay at this house!

Very nicely stocked with  towels, etc. anything you would need, they seem to have thought of it. Would come here again for sure!!

Very clean. Loved the fireplace outside!

Quiet neighborhood. The central location of this property made it great.

We had eight people in our party, with the youngest being 16 and this house was perfect.  We loved how close it was to all the things we wanted to do, including: river rafting, cave exploring, shopping, breweries, and walks along the beautiful Deschutes River.  We had a great time and made some awesome family memories.

We were in Bend for my Sister's Life Celebration and I had my own four adult kids and a granddaughter at the cottage.  We immediately felt at home and have already planned for a family reunion next year using the cottage as our home base.  We found it in top notch shape with fresh flowers all around, and hope we left it in  acceptable shape. Thank You, Vacasa!

Good value in a great location.  Appreciated opportunity to rent for only three nights during prime time.

If you are a person who loves being outdoors to walk, ride bikes, play tennis, take pictures or just enjoy nature, this is the place to be.  Wonderful house, plenty of room, loved the great fireplace.

Loved this property, especially the location--it's an easy walk for young children to the best pools on the property. House was clean and comfortable, and we would most definitely return!

Great location, nice house, good price!  We would definitely recommend it.

Black Butte is a really wonderful property. It has many, many things to do and is located in a wonderful setting.

Plan a memorable family getaway at this beautiful and spacious three-bedroom Bend vacation home in the popular and desirable River Wild development at Mt. Bachelor Resort. With a location less than 20 minutes from the slopes (there's even shuttle service available), you'll be skiing and snowboarding in no time. And in the summer months, you're only steps away from the Deschutes River Trail for hiking, biking, and other high desert outdoor activities.

Once inside you'll find a large, open great room/living room with a neutral color scheme, tall ceilings, lots of windows for natural light, and a gas fireplace for keeping the space warm and cozy. For the evening's entertainment (if you choose to stay in) there's a TV with a DVD player and cable so you don't have to miss the game or your favorite TV show. Plan a movie night with snacks, popcorn, and drinks, or just find a quiet spot to curl up with a book after everyone else has gone off to bed.

On the nights you are not enjoying one of Bend's great restaurants, this River Wild home features a gourmet-style kitchen with stainless steel appliances, a five-burner gas range, countertop island with a breakfast bar, and gorgeous hardwood floors. There's enough room for everyone to lend a hand and chop vegetables or for the foodie in the group to give an impromptu cooking lesson.

When it's time to sit down for a meal, in addition to the breakfast bar (a great kid's table), the formal dining area will seat up to six. After a day flying down the slopes, dig into a homemade lasagna, crusty French bread, and a bottle of red wine. And on nice sunny afternoons, you'll find that an outdoor dining table on the spacious wrap-around deck is the perfect spot for a light lunch before a hike or use the gas grill for a cookout - just grab the chops, steaks, and vegetable skewers at the grocery store in town.

The king master suite is on the main floor and will pamper it's lucky occupant with all of the comforts from home. At the end of the day, snuggle down into high thread-count bedding, surrounded by fluffy pillows and warm, cozy covers. There's a TV for late-night viewing and an attached full bathroom. This room also has access out onto the deck, so when the sun wakes you up, you can head outside to enjoy the sound of early morning birds or do some yoga stretches while the rest of the house sleeps in.

The two additional bedrooms are located upstairs - one with a queen bed and the other with twin-over-full bunk beds and a trundle bed. These two rooms share a bathroom (there's another half bath located downstairs). Both of these bedrooms have their own TVs with cable. In addition, there's WiFi throughout the house so checking email and getting online is easy whether you're in bed, out on the deck, or making the morning's coffee down in the kitchen. Other amenities include a washer and dryer, iPod dock, blow dryers, and alarm clocks.

Without even leaving the resort, you'll be able to take advantage of a number of amazing amenities! A short stroll on the Deschutes River Trail will take you to the community pool, hot tub, and tennis court - there's even a playground for the kids! And in winter, Mt. Bachelor Ski Resort is just a short drive away, or hop on the shuttle and get there without even having to start the car. Enjoy skiing and snowboarding for all levels at Mt. Bachelor ski resort, as well as cross-country skiing and snowshoeing throughout the Bend area.

Summertime brings its own set of activities to Central Oregon, including rock climbing and hiking at Smith Rock State Park, over 20 miles of trails for running, walking, or hiking on the Deschutes River Trail, and white water rafting on the Deschutes River.

Scenic downtown Bend is only three miles northeast with its cafes, bookstores, galleries, and the charming duck-and-greenery-filled Drake Park. Year-round, Wall and Bond streets are vibrant with shopping and people watching.

everything was great with this property, really enjoyed it, and plan on stayin there again.

We were very pleased with this home.

Excellent location near Bend & Mt. Bachelor.

Beautiful Home with tasteful decoration .

All detail covered, large rooms with

beds for  8 persons. The 2-car enclosed garage

was a plus and the wrap around porch was

another great feature as well as the fireplace.

exceeded our expectations and would not hesitate to stay again in the future.

Everything you would want in a vacation  stay.

Great property, good kitchen and outdoor space.  Very nice neighbor helped us out with the barbecue.  Everyone in our party commented on what a beautiful house this was with a great location.  Thank-you

A lovely home in a beautiful location. My family and I had a great time. We even had a welcoming committee of a family of California Quails.

Bend is one of our favorite get-a-way spots!  We have stayed in this area previously and had intended to vacation at another home we love located at Widgi Creek.  However, it was not available for the dates we needed.  Although we still love the other home, I'm glad we were able to find an alternative that we love almost as much!  We had 6 adults and 1 very busy 2 year old, the accommodations were perfect!  We will definitely be looking to stay here again in the future.

We stayed here with our two little kids and my parents. It was perfect for a family + grandparents with the two master suites. Bend is awesome!

We had a fantastic stay here on our ski trip. The condo is super close to Mt. Bachelor, you basically turn left and follow the road for 20 minutes. Loved the fireplace and all the games that were available. Beds were really firm and very comfortable. We also used the hot tub at the lodge, we were the only ones in it at 9am. Safeway is less than two miles away and the oven and coffee maker worked great. The only complaint we have is that our Subaru Impreza wagon bottomed out pulling into and out of the garage, and our car isn't particularly low. We ended up parking in front of the garage the whole time. Would definitely stay here again!

While we loved the location of this house, we were disappointed by the quality of the furnishings. The couch had a whole in the cushion, the upstairs bathtub had a hole in it, the only large fry pan was unusable as the non-stick coating was peeling off of it, the griddle pan was rusty and peeling, the broiler pan was rusty, the beds were horribly uncomfortable, there were three flood lights out in the kitchen when arrived leaving it very dark, the only lamp in the upstairs smaller bedroom was broken, so we had to snag one from the other upstairs bedroom, leaving both bedrooms very, very dark, the bath mats in the upstairs bathroom were very stained, there was hair in the bathroom drawers, the ice maker was broken and leaked all over the inside of the freezer...and the list goes on.  In addition, the angle was so steep going into the garage that both our minivan and sedan cars bottomed out, leaving the garage unusable and our cars with scratched undercarriages. Horribly disappointing...

This house exceeded all of our expectations.

Only reason we would not stay in this location is that we were a little apprehensive about the kids playing on the street. There is no yard area for them to play in and with it being a corner and a narrow street... there just wasn't much of a spot for them to play without us worrying a bit. Having said that, we loved the house and the proximity to other places, so if we didn't find an alternative, we'd stay here again. Beautiful home, great stay!

In the heart of all the Sisters action

Plan a visit to Central Oregon for the Sisters Rodeo or Folk Festival and stay at this adorable three-bedroom Sisters vacation rental! During your stay you'll have amenities like WiFi, cable, and a DVD player, as well as a comfortable and spacious master bedroom and a cozy reading nook in the upstairs loft! It's a perfect home-away-from-home for the whole family.

A newer craftsman construction, from this Sisters getaway you can walk right to downtown. From the front porch you can view Black Crater -  a large peak in the Central Cascades. And while the shops and restaurants of downtown Sisters are just a few blocks away, in winter the Hoodoo Ski Area is only 22 miles from this Sisters vacation rental and the town of Bend is a 30 minute drive away.

Relax on the spacious front porch with a glass of iced tea or wine in the afternoons - chances are the Central Oregon weather will be nice and sunny! But when you do spend time indoors, the downstairs living room is a peaceful, comfortable spot to read a book, or borrow a board game from the shelf and spread it out to play.

There's a full kitchen with granite countertops and shiny stainless steel appliances. A butcher block island provides even more space for chopping vegetables or grating cheese. And when it's time to clean up, don't worry - you'll have a dishwasher to get everything taken care of quickly.

When you do sit down to meals, there are seats for six guests, and you could always sit the kids up in the family room with dinner, while the adults enjoy a sit-down meal downstairs. Although this home does not have air conditioning, there are box fans and if you keep the blinds closed during the day and the windows open at night, you'll stay cool and comfortable in this wonderful Sisters retreat!

Able to sleep up to eight guests, this Sisters vacation home has a lovely master bedroom on the main level (right off the living room) with a king-sized bed and a full bathroom with double sinks and spacious walk-in closet. Upstairs you'll find two additional rooms - one with a queen bed and the other with two twins beds. There is a full bathroom that these two comfortable bedrooms share (as well as an additional half bath downstairs for extra convenience). All of the bedrooms have ceiling fans, and accessories like bedside tables and reading lamps.

Also upstairs, is a cozy little loft area - perfect for reading (feel free to borrow a book if you've left yours at home!), playing a board game, or even doing a little work if you need to - there's a printer available for guest use. A second floor family room has a TV, DVD player, and spots for everyone to relax - including a sleeper sofa for even more bed options at night. There are wonderful skylights up here, adding an abundance of natural light to the room. After a light dinner, just pop some popcorn and head up here for a family movie night!

The charming Central Oregon town of Sisters has a lot going for it - a gorgeous and scenic high desert geography, trails for mountain biking and hiking, and numerous fly fishing sites along the Metolius River, Whychus Creek, and Three Creek lake. Lace up your trail shoes and head out on the Sisters Tie Trail or make your way along Black Butte Lookout - a moderate 3.8 mile hike that boasts amazing views from its summit. And don't worry about keeping clean while you're out having an adventure - you have a washer and dryer waiting for you back at your Locust Lane Retreat.

For a community of its size (just over 2,000 residents), small-town Sisters is a popular event destination due to the annual Sisters Rodeo (June), Quilt Show (July), and Folk Festival (September), as well as a thriving arts and music scene year-round. There are galleries and shops with western-themed art, clothing, and gifts. Also while in town, be sure to stop by the Sisters Bakery for homemade doughnuts, pizza, and chocolate eclairs or the Sisters Coffee Company on Hood Avenue for lattes and snacks in a warm, log cabin/lodge-like interior.

This Central Oregon vacation rental offers an ideal home-base for exploring Sisters, attending the rodeo, or heading to Hoodoo Ski Area for a family ski trip. Whether you stay near the house and relax or go on day trips to nearby Bend and Smith Rock State Park, this Sisters retreat has it all!

We were quite pleased with our stay in this house.   Very nicely furnished, this was truly a comfortable place for our family while in the Sisters area.  We would certainly be happy to stay here again.

i'm not the kind of guy that writes rave reviews about something like this, but we had such a good time that I can't help but at least mention that this house, location, and the overall experience just couldn't have been better. We stayed here with another family; we have a seven, five, and one-year-old, and our friends had two kids of similar age. We were extremely comfortable and happy at the home.  When we do this again, we will try and get the same house.

Only 2 small complaints:   The pillows, being down, were very soft and had to double them up.  We were able to borrow some from family in town.  Also the pull out sofa was pretty uncomfortable and so my daughter just used the extra pads in the master closet and slept on the floor.   But we loved the house and would like to return!!

We had a great time. Would do it again, kind of dark at key location unless we thought to turn on outside light by garage door. We were pleasantly surprised with how new the house felt and how comfortable we all felt. We loved our experience.

Stayed here with my 2 kids and the property was perfect! Had everything we needed then some! Thanks again!

As it's right near the Aspen Lakes Golf Course, you may want to bring your clubs as well as your pets when you stay here! The trip into Sisters proper is only about three miles and if you want to head to bustling Bend for breweries and shopping, it's only a scenic 30-minute drive.

As picture-perfect inside as it is on the outside, the spacious interior boasts a comfortable living room complete with a wood-burning fireplace and plush furniture for relaxing. Sit back and enjoy the evening after a day spent riding your horses or walking around the charming town of Sisters. There are even two wingback chairs, perfect for curling up with a good book.

This lower level also has a full kitchen, complete with a stainless steel appliances and a breakfast bar, as well as a separate dining table for four. You'll even have a dishwasher for easy clean-up after your vacation feasts.

The bedroom downstairs has two twin beds, along with a door leading out to the spacious viewing deck. From here you can admire the horse pasture and, if you've brought your own horses, the pen. There is also a full bathroom adjoining this bedroom, as well as a large closet.

Upstairs, you'll find a loft and the second bedroom with a queen bed and rocking chair, in addition to a spot with a TV (with DishTV service), a comfortable chair, and a bookshelf full of books - the perfect place to spend a lazy afternoon. There is also a second full bathroom on this upper level. Up to five guests can stay comfortably at this Sisters retreat (with a maximum occupancy of six)! And while there's no WiFi, you'll have plenty of activities to pick from.

If you do choose to bring two pets with you, there is an additional nightly fee. Other amenities include a washer and dryer, so there's no need to over-pack!

Sit on the deck and watch the horses, plan a whitewater rafting trip on the Deschutes River, or simply recharge and get away from it all here.

Besides your own two acres and the vibrant town of Sisters nearby, in winter, it's only 25 miles to Hoodoo Ski Area. In June, there's the annual Sisters Rodeo in town, and year-round there are shops and galleries to peruse. No matter the season, make the quick drive into town and start your day with a latte and muffin at the Sisters Coffee Company while you check your email.

Western-themed Sisters is also home to an annual folk music festival, as well as numerous hiking and biking trails - all against the backdrop of three volcanic mountain peaks, the Three Sisters.

You'll definitely discover the beauty of Oregon's high desert when you stay at this dog and horse-friendly Central Oregon vacation rental!

Wow, what a great condo!  The owners have modernized the interior so it looks much classier than the exterior initially may suggest. Fantastic renovation job.  I loved being able to walk to downtown. Bend is a magical place in Sept/Oct-- I highly recommend this property!

We booked this property pretty last minute.  Vacasa staff was helpful, and responded very quickly.  We appreciated that very much.  The location of the property was perfect for our needs.  We wanted to be close to downtown Bend, and you could walk there in less than 10 minutes.  You are right next to the river, and a walking trail, which was also great.  The unit has a nice view of the grassy courtyard in the complex, and overall we found the unit relatively quiet (you can hear guests upstairs walking around)  and easy to get to.

Essentials were fine, internet, TV and the bed.  It did have 2 bathrooms which was very nice.  Beyond that, we found the unit a bit industrial, not that inviting (we understand many people like industrial), and lacking in a few items.  Kitchenware was a bit sparse, but they did have some extra items that you would not normally find in a rental, like waffle iron and panini grill.  It also had a nice bbq on the deck.

It lacked some functionality in the bedroom, with no real dresser, etc. to put clothes, just a stand with some baskets.  No TV  - not an issue for us.  It also did not have good lighting next to the beds, if for example you wanted to sit in bed and read.  No clock or clock radio.  The comfort of the bed was ok.

For the price, we felt it was a reasonable good deal, especially considering the location.  Next time we go to Bend, though, we will probably look for a place that is a little be warmer and more inviting.

Wondering where you got your couch.? I love it. Great location.  Golfed alot of surrounding courses. Nice relaxing home.

Just like the pictures this is a modern update in an older complex. Sits on side of property overlooking large lawn so plenty of privacy. Appliances are tip-top. Bed is luxurious. Fireplace is nice touch. Be sure to take the river walk, it is steps from the south side of the complex.

Adjacent to a very nice park and the Deschutes river.  Only a two minute drive to downtown.  Pool and hot tub were an added bonus.

Great condo!! Very clean and modern! a little farther from downtown then expected.

Perfect for a couple or a couple with 1 or 2 small children.  The second bed was not big enough for 2 teenage children.

Extremely clean.  Two full bathrooms and large master with a true king size bed.  Kitchen is stocked with all pots and pans and everything you could want to cook a meal...even a salad spinner!  WiFi connectivity could be improved upon - I kept getting dropped.  The location is superb - right on the river and and close to downtown.

This one room, one bedroom condo is cozy and upscale with stainless steel accents, leather, and black and white decor. The bed is a queen, and there's a futon couch on which you can either watch cable or a Blu-ray DVD from the mounted TV, or enjoy the gas fireplace in the corner.

The full, gourmet kitchen lines the back wall - you'll find all the necessary cutlery and an efficient, industrial vibe that will make the hipster in you smile.

The bathroom had a shower/tub combo, and there's a deck for quiet time outside.

Enjoy access to a pool and hot tub on site in a greenhouse-like structure to catch the best light. Well-behaved dogs are welcome in this pet-friendly home, although please note that there is an additional nightly fee.

Exploring Mt. Bachelor by ski, snowshoe, bike, or on foot is easy from this condo, as it's only 22 or so miles away. The Deschutes makes for a great kayaking, rafting, or fishing expedition. There are trails to follow, mountains to climb, and caves to explore here.

Not much for the outdoors? Visit the cute town of Sisters for fun antique shops, or wander through downtown to try one of of Bend's renowned brews year-round.

This Central Oregon vacation condo will keep you cozy and provide you with the best access to Oregon fun that you can imagine!

Great location and updated unit for the two of us!  All went smoothly for a few days of hiking,  SUP and dining out!!

We loved this cute little studio.  Next time we will rent a 1 bedroom just for the floor space.  The location is fantastic.  Grounds are beautiful and Pioneer Park is right out the door.  We enjoyed the path to town and along the river everyday.  We will be back :-)

We enjoyed the new kitchen which was loaded with several extra appliances plus new barbecue tools.   It was very well equipped for a studio and we would stay at this complex with Vacasa again.    Great location by the river and walking distance to town.

When I had a question I just phoned the number given to me and I was given immediate assistance.

It was difficult getting the code to work at the gate each night, but eventually the gate opened - we noticed other patrons had the same problem.

It was very cute, clean and modern. The location was perfect. We walked to town everyday we were there. We happened to be there on a "First Friday" of the month and there were lots of things going on downtown. It was my first time to Bend and I would definitely go back. We even got engaged on a hike near Mt Hood!

We stayed at this studio for 2 nights. The building is older. The inside of the condo has been completely remodeled (all IKEA stuff). It is in a good location, but BEWARE...

Pros: Great location, very close to The Shops at Old Mill district and River walk. It is nice to have a Kitchen and an outdoor BBQ

Cons:

- Ants Problem! They are all over the kitchen counter and the floor!! It is hard to see the ants since the kitchen counter is dark granite and the floor is also darker hardwood. We noticed them the first night because they were crawling on my daughter! We notified Vacasa and they offered to bring us some ants trap. However, we declined because the last thing we want is to lure out hundreds more ants during our stay because they'd be attracted to the bait. YUCK!!

- There's an indoor pool, but the water was very cold, I don't think it was heated.

- Keep in mind that this is a very small studio, fit 2 people. Anymore than that, you will feel very cramp and uncomfortable.

We loved everything about this place. We will def stay again on out next trip to Bend!

Great little studio, very clean. I felt like I was sleeping in an IKEA display which is not a bad thing. Easy walking to downtown Bend shopping and breweries, plus two great parks nearby. There is a river walk along the Dechutes that is lovely and actually several miles long if you have the time. Perfect for a weekend away with a great kitchen, would totally do it again!

We had a great time in Bend over Thanksgiving weekend with our dogs! We had a ton of leftovers from Thanksgiving so it was great having the kitchen to warm up our leftovers and sit by the fire. The property was a great location, right near downtown where we walked to many of the bars. Thanks for an awesome stay!

The photos don't lie, the studio is nicely updated. But sadly throughout my stay I ran into one problem after the next. And ultimately, I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it to another traveler.

1. Key code did not work for guest box upon arrival. Vacasa supplied a backup code that allowed me access to the housekeeping lockbox. Issue was quickly resolved. But this was the first of many snags.

2. Not enough blankets provided (one bedspread, one fleece blanket, one flat sheet). It was freezing temps during my stay. Welcome manual says there is an extra blanket in the ottoman, but it was not there (just two beach towels and two pillow cases). I called requesting an extra blanket. Vacasa followed up with a phone call and email saying they were looking for a housekeeper to fulfill the request. Nothing arrived that night, so I purchased a blanket myself. 24 hours after making the request, the blanket finally arrived.

3. Bedding: Didn't smell or feel freshly laundered. Might be time to either replace the linens and/or ensure that everything down to the mattress pad is washed heavily under hot temps.

4. Pump for conditioner in the shower is broken. Did not dispense.

5. WiFi not working properly. Vacasa gave instructions on how to reset the router, but the location of the router was never disclosed.

6. Other things that would improve the stay:

- provide earplugs: unit is very noisy; refrigerator cycles through operations throughout the night (bed is five feet from the refrigerator), neighbors upstairs are moving constantly, walls are overall thin with traffic and ambient noise very audible

- provide a dresser or luggage stand: otherwise there's nowhere to put your clothes or sit your luggage

- essential safety items: fire extinguisher, first aid kit

- map of the complex: detailing laundry, pool, parking, etc.

While the unit is nicely decorated, it's lacking some essential elements that make for pleasant and comfortable stay.

I think there needs to be better instructions on how to use the a/c unit.  Also had some trouble connecting to the internet.  Other than those two issues we loved our unit and would stay there again!  Very clean and comfy.

This condo is very reasonable priced and with a perfect location within walking distance of downtown, and with river access. The unit is upgraded and quite nice though we could never get the internet to work.
#Pathname:/usa/Oregon/Sisters/
Only 22 miles northwest of Bend, lies the unique, Western-themed town of Sisters, a laid back, small town pick for a cozy Central Oregon vacation rental. The city's namesake is the Three Sisters - three volcanic mountain peaks in Oregon's Cascade Range and its relatively small population of a little over 2000 inhabitants belies its overabundance of events, outdoor activities, galleries, and opportunities for fun.

Once called "The Biggest Little Show in the World," the town has been the location for the annual Sisters Rodeo every second weekend of June since its start in 1914. Another big draw is the Sisters Folk Festival each year in September. After spending the day cheering on the cowboys (and girls) or celebrating American roots music, you'll want to make your way to Three Creeks Brewing Company for pints of Fivepine Porter and Flatbread Reubens or the Sisters Coffee Company for a caffeine-filled pick-me-up and a homey, log cabin atmosphere. Neither option quite your thing? With more eateries than you would expect from a town its size, don't worry, there's something for everyone's tastes.

Numerous outdoor activities take advantage of the region's lakes, mountains, rivers and natural areas for hiking, biking, skiing, and horseback riding excursions. The Sisters Tie Trail is a six mile pathway that is more of a country stroll than a strenuous workout. The trail runs parallel to Highway 20 and you'll enter the woods, emerging a bit later after an enjoyable country walk. Golfers can practice their swings at not one, but three 18-hole golf courses. Closest to Sisters, Aspen Lakes Golf Course shows off the Cascade Mountain range views and is as challenging as it is scenic.

Mountain bikers can head out to the Peterson Ridge Trail, just south of town. Part of a 25-mile multi-use trail system, riders, joggers, and dog walkers of all levels are accommodated with an easy-to-moderate difficulty level. From your cozy Sisters vacation rental, an excursion to the nearby Metolius River offers a number of activities! A tributary of the Deschutes River, this crystal clear waterway flows for about 37 miles with ample fly fishing spots for catch and release native rainbow trout, Kokonee salmon, and bull trout.

In winter, like a lot of towns in the Cascade Mountain Range, Sisters is close to skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing adventures. Hoodoo Ski Area is about 20 miles from the center of town. With a top elevation of 5,700 feet, Hoodoo offers excellent Alpine skiing, as well as Nordic trails, and for the dare devils, even snowbike lessons. At under 30 miles away, Smith Rock State Park is a prime destination for rock climbers and hikers with picturesque deep river canyons, High Desert rock formations, and wildlife viewing opportunities for golden eagles, prairie falcons, mule deer, and river otter.

From Sisters, another day trip possibility is the resort town of Sunriver, a 45 minute drive south, boasting a state-of-the-art aquatic center, multiple golf courses, and many multi-use trails. Of course, you might just opt to stay close to your Sisters vacation rental and enjoy all the charms this quaint little Western community has to offer. But, before you head home, make sure to stop by Leavitt's Western Wear and pick yourself up a cowboy hat to always remember your Sisters vacation!

Experience all the reasons to visit Black Butte Ranch on one gorgeous acre when you stay at this amazing tri-level Black Butte Ranch vacation home with a private hot tub, unique two-sided fireplace, and gorgeous outdoor deck! Surrounded by trees and offering views out towards the nearby Glaze Meadows Golf Course, this home boasts an excellent location on a private cul de sac near all the facilities and astounding natural beauty that come with your visit to Black Butte Ranch Resort.

Make the trip over to nearby Sisters for some shopping, dining, and - if your timing's right  -  some great music. Skiers and boarders will be in their element with a trip to Hoodoo Resort, about 20 minutes away. Bend, with its bustling brewpubs and Central Oregon shopping, is just 30 minutes further.

On a chilly Cascade morning, make your way to the family room before breakfast and throw a log on the fire in the grand, stone fireplace. Sink into the plush furniture, the beautiful hardwood floors and wood ceilings gleaming in the mountain sunlight, bring up the laptop, and check the weather forecast for the day's destinations on the free WiFi.

At mealtime, turn your cook loose in this bright, fully-equipped kitchen with earth-tone tile floor, track lighting, recessed stove and piggy back oven and microwave, providing extra counter space for prep and lots of cabinets for supplies. When the dinner bell rings, lay out the meal on the big dining set with room for six. If it's cold, you'll be nice and warm, seated on the kitchen side of the two-sided fireplace that also opens to the living area. There's also room for four more hungry guests on the stools at the bar. Weather permitting, throw some salmon on the gas grill out on the back deck, barbecue your meal, and feast among the beautifully landscaped backyard and towering pines.

After a good soak in the hot tub out back, it's time for bed. With two bedrooms on the main floor and a master upstairs in the loft, this spacious home will accommodate eight. The first lower-level bedroom has a queen bed, and the other with two twins. Both are tastefully decorated in a country decor with comfortable linens, and share the first floor's full bathroom. Luxurious and large, the upper-level master bedroom echoes the living room's decor, with the same gorgeous hardwood floor and vaulted wood ceiling, along with its own full bathroom.

Up in the loft, you can watch the morning headlines on cable TV or enjoy a DVD before bed. There's a sleeper sofa for two additional guests, and the home also has an additional half-bath for everyone's convenience. You can definitely pack light: there's a washer and dryer in the home, too.

Along with all the wonderful amenities that come with this home, for a small fee* you'll also have access to the Black Butte Ranch facilities: the Glaze Meadow Recreation Center featuring indoor and outdoor swimming pools, hot tub, children's wading pool, steam room, workout facilities, a sports shop, equipment rental shop and spa. Take the bikes out on the 18 miles of paved bike paths or take some fly-fishing lessons over at Phalarope Lake. And since you'll be enjoying views of the Glaze Meadow Golf Course throughout your stay, you should probably bring your clubs along!

Come stay in this lovely home in Oregon's Cascade Mountains and experience all that beautiful Central Oregon vacation home has to offer!

*When you arrive at the Black Butte Ranch resort, you will need to register at the Welcome Center. Please be aware that there is a $6 daily fee for every guest above 8 years old for access to the recreational facilities and that this fee will be collected by the resort at the time of check-in. Unfortunately, no motorcycles are permitted within the ranch or on any of the Black Butte properties.*

Big kitchen. Works for several cooks.  Split level home with the MB 1/2 flight upstairs and the other two bedrooms 1/2 flight downstairs.  Living area in between.  Only one TV, in the loft,  3rd level.  Great hang out place for the kids but the sound carries down stairs.  Girls loved the safe cul de sac for riding bikes.

Private, clean and full of amenities.

Would stay there again.

This house is near the glaze meadow golf club house, but is very far away from all the other ranch amenities. We were disappointed that we had to drive, instead of bike, everywhere. It was a fine house, but we felt it didn't quite live up to the expectations of the photos.

We had some difficulty locating this house as the Black Butte Ranch doesn't have enough signage, but does have unusual names for roads that are printed sideways on posts and many cul de sacs.

If you need bikes, this house comes with about 5 of all sizes.  The  clean hot tub is wonderful after a busy day.  The loft is nice, but because of the location of the TV, the sound is broadcast into the kitchen and living room below.  There are plenty of books to read and a few games.

We were there mid-June when it was 80+ degrees during the day and mid-40's during the night.  No AC, but the fans were lovely to keep everyone cool during the days.  Large washer and dryer kept the kids clean.   Detergent pods and dryer sheets were provided.

Beds are quite firm in the master and queen bedrooms.

Great house! Very Clean. The wood burning fireplace was a real treat as was the hot tub!

Nice quiet location, neat fireplace.  No TV in main quarters, there is one in the loft.  The bed in the master is fantastic if you like a firm mattress.  Home was very clean.

This place is amazing.   The room was very clean and comfortable.  It is right next to the Deschutes River and a beatiful park .   Its also any easy walk to the downtown area that has several great breweries.  We will come back.

A perfect place to stay and explore BEND. A short walk to downtown, Pioneer Park, and the Deschutes river walk.  Super comfy bed!

If you are looking for a place to stay close to downtown, this is a great option. It's a modest little condo but clean, comfortable and has easy access to downtown Bend.

Easy directions and excellent location.  Bend is a beautiful place to visit with too many activities to mention.

hi, we'd stay here again.  it's great location, clean and spacious.  the staff was welcoming and had the fireplace on before we arrived.  The only two things you might want to know is that the building is in the back so while it's private, it's up two flights of stairs and there isn't a view.

The condo was clean and welcoming when we arrived. It was just the right size for 2 people.  It does have a Murphy bed and convertible couch but the actual space available would feel too crowded for a larger number of guests.  The opportunity to bring our dog was wonderful!  The condo is adjacent to a park providing a good area to walk your dog.  All of the staff went out of their way to be helpful.  The condo location is about a 10-15 minute easy walk to downtown Bend.  The parking lot was promptly plowed after a snow storm.  Our only complaint is the wifi network wasn't reliable despite efforts on the part of the staff.  If you don't mind using your own data allowance this may not affect you.

Have to say the bed in Summit was the most comfortable bed - and pillows - we have ever experienced!  The small, but fully stocked kitchen was so handy for our needs (even though it does not have a dishwasher) and we appreciated having his & hers bathrooms.  It's an easy stroll to the Deschutes River and a short 2 or 3 blocks walk to town.  Good value for the money too!

Amazing place, reasonably priced and  conveniently located near downtown. The condo was very clean, do stay here.

A fair amount of street noise.  View of other units.  The unit was nice.

This is a very reasonable place to stay that is close to downtown and the river.  The complex may not look like much on the outside, but the interior of this unit was clean and comfortable.  It was a perfect location for us to spend a couple of nights in Bend.  We will likely be back soon.

Warm & welcoming home with shared hot tub, pool, and more!

You will have a difficult time finding a more magnificent view than from this gorgeous three-bedroom Black Butte vacation home! With access to the resort's recreation amenities including pools, hot tubs, tennis, and more, family trips to this retreat are full of activity and relaxation.

Black Butte Ranch is a resort community 32 miles north of Bend, and about nine miles from Sisters.

This beautiful Northwest contemporary retreat  has all the conveniences of home. Floor-to-ceiling windows, two fireplaces, an eclectic collection of framed wall art add luxurious touches that you'll enjoy during your stay.

The main level offers a sunken living room with tall ceilings, large windows, and wonderful wood-burning fireplace. The new large plasma flat screen TV  (without cable) has a DVD player, and a small DVD library just waiting for all of your entertainment needs. There is WiFi throughout. Or you may just find the best entertainment is relaxing on the comfy seat cushions, while looking out the wall of windows, and enjoying morning coffee or a glass of wine in the evening.

The kitchen and dining room have dazzling hardwood floors and more windows looking out into the trees and meadow. There's a wood stove in the dining room for both ambiance and warmth, and table seating for four. Right nearby in the kitchen, there are extra stools at the breakfast bar and plenty of counter space for whipping up delicious vacation meals. A skylight lets in a lot of natural light, and besides all of the usual gadgets, there's also a blender and coffee grinder for your use.

A glass door leads out to the large deck overlooks the natural spring and provides tranquil sounds of water below, with Black Butte's meadow stretching out into the distance. The gas barbecue is all ready for your cook-outs and al fresco dining. In the afternoon, it's also the perfect spot to put your feet up and get into a good book.

The main level has a lovely master bedroom - with a queen bed and en suite bathroom with a jetted tub and separate shower, it's quite a peaceful and relaxing spot. The lucky recipient of this room will also be treated to amazing views right off the deck. This level has a second bedroom with a queen bed.

Upstairs, there is another queen bedroom, a reading room with cozy, overstuffed chairs, and an adjoining sitting room with a twin bed. The upstairs is ideal for family members or a couple with small children that want to share a more private area of the house. The views out to the Butte and over the meadow are spectacular. With its three bedrooms and loft, this home will sleep seven guests comfortably; the provided washer/dryer make it easy to keep packing light.

Outside, there's a wonderful yard to discover, a free-standing porch swing, and lots of space for the kids to play.

Beyond the yard, Black Butte Ranch offers outdoor adventures for everyone in your group. In the winter, you can make the short 20 minute drive to Sisters and Hoodoo Ski area for downhill sporting at its best. The surrounding National Forest land has many trails for both cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling in the winter, as well as hiking and biking in the summer.

A couple of white water rafting outfitters have pick-up and drop off service at the Rec Barn at Black Butte Ranch. Plan a family adventure they won't soon forget with a fun-filled half day McKenzie or Deschutes River trip. Black Butte Resort also has two golf courses, tennis courts, horseback riding, and five swimming pools. You will definitely have no problem finding something to do here!

On days that you don't feel like cooking, you can head to the Lodge Restaurant for fine dining, or to Robert's Pub for casual plates. For even more options, visit the cute western-style shops and cafes in Sisters, and Bend's popular breweries and restaurants are a mere 45 minutes from your door.

Come to Black Butte Ranch and enjoy this Central Oregon vacation home's bright spaces, shiny hardwood floors, and fabulous deck for entertaining and enjoy all that this resort community offers in style.

I almost didn't write a review because I don't want this GEM to fill up all the time.  Best property we have stayed at at BBR, and our family has been travelling there for 20 years.

This house has an amazing view of the Big Meadow and Black Butte from the family room, kitchen, master bedroom and large deck. In addition to several days of blue sky and sunshine , we enjoyed the opportunity to watch a spectacular lightning storm from the hilltop vantage point. We also took full advantage of the deck furniture as we ate most of our meals outside. Although many of the interior finishes in this home are dated (lots of golden oak and late 80s/early-90s colors), it has a nice layout and plenty of natural light. The kitchen is well-equipped, and the family room and bedrooms have newer TVs. The wireless Internet access also is a plus. It is somewhat inconvenient to be unable to access the garage for bike storage. Overall, we had a fabulous vacation at this house and would recommend it to our family and friends.

A wonderful wood stove warms the vaulted main level living area, and the hardwood floors and wood accent walls invite you to simply curl up and relax by the fire.

The location and general layout of the house is fine and our dogs loved the large water dish and extensive deck area.  However, having one shower for 5 people (house could accommodate 8) is rather inconvenient to say the least.  During our stay at Black Butte the weather was extremely hot and no air-conditioning made the visit uncomfortable.  I realize this was an unusually warm season but air conditioning should be considered since our research while at the ranch noted this is the third year of such high temperatures.

Wonderful cozy place. We had a great time last weekend.  Location was pretty good close to the main lodge and golf course ! Loved the swimming pool area ! THe kids simply loved the loft area and didnt want to even venture out of the home.  Loved the collection of movies, books. THanks to the owners for giving us a great time..

So when I first saw the review online for this rental, I wasn't interested.  BUT, I waited to the last moment and this was really the only place that was available, so I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  It's not amazing and totally up-to-date, but you're also not paying a premium for that.  It's on the Ranch, within some cute trails, is safe, and clean.  I really was expecting the worst and was pleased that it was better than expected.

Would definitely stay here again. The two master suites is a great feature as well as the amazing deck, right on the golf course.

Great hours for a couple families or a small group of golfers!

Our family found this home to be a wonderful  vacation home. We enjoyed the location, cleanliness, and comfort of the home.  We definitely plan to return.

Our family of six, with two g-parents and two g-kids, fit nicely into this unit. Loved the twin-master layout. Kitchen was amazing for our Thanksgiving dinner. The instructions were helpful, but mentioned a 'shared sauna' and instructions for its use - but didn't say where it was and we didn't find it. Ha! Pretty funny. The hot tub we found and it was excellent. Thanks much! Can't wait to go back.

This was our second time in this unit, and we enjoyed it just as much as the first time!!  The well stocked kitchen was very much appreciated, as we didn't have to pack all of that stuff from home.  This unit has spoiled us for many other units that we have used in the past!  We would definitely come again, depending on this size of our group.

This is a very nice house with a great golf course view and conveniently located to anywhere you want to go. It could stand some softer beds though.

Very relaxing, large kitchen and pantry for entertaining, great view of the 12th fairway, comfortable hot tub, spacious rooms, and have 3.5 baths was sure nice.  Love the layout and we plan to stay here again.

.Very nice, very clean 2 master bedrooms and a third that could be a master makes sleeping arrangements top notch.  Indoor and out door furnishings were also good, as well  as the kitchen had every thing that was needed plus more.

We did have a good storm roll through with hail the size of golf balls........ Oh wait that was a golf ball that hit the deck ;) So we simply waited for the gentlemen to retrieve his ball and asked if he needed a drink to help relax his swing. He politely declined and the sun shinned on.  Good Times For All.

Will stay here again.

We had 5 adults and 2 children in this home.  It was very clean and had a well stocked kitchen.  The 3 bedrooms were spacious and the three large beds were very comfortable.  This was our first time at  Eagle Crest so it was fun to explore.

We enjoyed our stay here....we had friends over for a birthday party and the place was great to accomidate our group of friends.....The deck had nice views of  the 12 th fairway.....the hot tub was nice and relaxing....it was fully furnished and had all of the kitchen utensils you could possibley need......would come back

We spent 12 days here for an annual Church festival, enjoying the deer on the green, and we even spotted two cougars one morning!  The well stocked kitchen was a joy to work in - especially when we didn't have to pack all of our own personal kitchenware!  Overall, we were quite happy with the time we spent here, even though we don't golf. We highly recommend this property, but would warn that there could be problems if you are allergic to animal dander.

I loved the location. The house was great. It was clean. I would not stay there again until they get a/c.

My family and I greatly enjoyed our trip to Black Butte. The house was the perfect size for us. My main caution is that if you are coming during warm weather, note that there is no AC and no screens on the upstairs windows.

The house as a whole was clean and welcoming. When a couple things were needed, the Vacasa staff were very helpful. I really appreciated it. Overall, a great experience.

This big, beautiful contemporary vacation home in Eagle Crest Resort is perched on Cline Butte, offering one of the most spectacular views from Smith Rocks all the way east to the entire Ochoco Mountain Range. The many windows and skylights in this home let that bright Eastern Oregon sunshine into every room and its clean, modern design elements create the perfect backdrop for your high desert vacation plans.

The great room is filled with plenty of comfortable modern furnishings and has big, bright windows that flood the open great room with natural light. Sectional sofas, an ottoman, wall-to-wall plush carpeting, a colorful throw rug, and gas fireplace give this space a luxurious but comfortable vibe, ideal for nestling down and enjoying the sunset with a cup of herbal tea or a nightcap before bed on chilly evenings. This room also includes recessed lighting and a flatscreen TV for movie marathons with the kids (or just catching up on your favorite television shows!).

Up a couple of steps, the dining room and kitchen have beautiful hardwood flooring, continuing recessed lighting, and more large windows. The dining table seats six easily, and there's additional breakfast bar seating for two if needed. There's even a long buffet table for laying out a serve yourself style feast for everyone!

The large and sunny kitchen has stainless steel appliances, including a gas range and dishwasher. The gourmet chef's island adds an abundance of counter space to create everything from fancy, sit-down dinners to simple sandwiches and salads for picnic lunches in the surrounding great outdoors. There's even a coffee grinder so you can sip the freshest possible cup! A big cedar deck off the kitchen has a gas barbecue for grilling steaks and veggies on evenings when the weather is so nice you just don't want to go inside yet (spoiler alert: that will probably be every night).

Even the half bathroom on the main floor is stunning and beautifully designed, with earth-toned slab tile counters and impossibly tall sky-lit ceilings. It's more like being in a small gallery than a powder room.

All three bedrooms in this house are located upstairs, and provide comfortable accommodations for up to seven guests.

Many things we loved about the house and we'd probably try to stay again, but improvements needed with cleaning and amenities listed. Trying to work from the property proved to be impossible with no cable or Internet.

Thank you again for the opportunity to give feedback. I do believe the Vacasa employees tried to help the best they could.

The whole rental process was very easy. The home was lovely w/ great views & had everything we needed. Enjoyed our stay immensely. Very nice kitchen for those who like to cook & well stocked w/ cookware. Worth noting that all 3 bedrooms were upstairs which was just fine for us but if anyone has trouble w/ stairs, that could be challenging.

This location is perfect for family with kids. If you want to utilize the pools at Eagle crest this location is a very short drive to the best pool in the resort. The spray park and small child's pool is the best in the resort. There's is a food truck that makes a grilled cheese and other yummy lunch foods. It's the only pool that allows you to bring picnic lunch into pool area and the kiddie pool has lots of shade. The kitchen and floor plan are perfect with a very open floor plan. The house and beds are very comfortable!!  It should be noted that the stairs are steep and there are no child safety gates available so bring your own.

We wanted to boat on Lake Billy-Chinook for the weekend and stayed at this great house.  We enjoyed the home very much.  Thank you.

This house was fabulous! ! From bikes, to fishing poles, to laundry soap, to spices... This place had it all - Thank u for letting us stay.

Cable tv and Internet never worked, for the entire week, despite my emailing or calling vacasa every day of the weeklong stay. It turns out the home owner never paid their bill, and was not reachable to do so. Had to use my phone for everything, not sure how much I will have to pay for that data yet.

Soap and shampoo were micro- size, good for maybe 2 days, like you get in cheap hotels... But we were there for a week.

Meals will be easy to prepare here in your well-stocked full kitchen. Bright and spacious, you'll have all the major appliances you'll need on the evenings you don't head out to one of Eagle Crest's restaurants (there are three, as well as the resort's unique poolside eatery).

Good location but that's about it. Thin walls and can hear neighbors walking up and down the stairs. A/C was set to 72 which kept the downstairs cool but the upstairs was a sweat box. The master bedroom is right over the deck of the neighbors so be prepared to hear every word if they are outside and you open the windows.  The lighting inside is poor and has a cave-like feel because of it. I would not stay in this type of unit again

My husband was running in the Smith Ascent race at Smith Rock and this location was exactly what we needed. We chose to go with a VRBO b/c we had his mother in town and we wanted to make sure he slept well prior to the race (unlike some hotels which can be noisy), and we are glad we did!

The master bed and bath were great! Two sinks, large bath, separate toilet. Large, comfy bed. Easy to operate TV. Perfect. The guest room had 2 twins which I wasn't expecting (but would have known had I read the details more carefully). His mom said she slept great though!

The location was perfect. About 20 minutes from Bend, and about 25 minutes from Smith Rock.

Thanks for sharing with us :-)
