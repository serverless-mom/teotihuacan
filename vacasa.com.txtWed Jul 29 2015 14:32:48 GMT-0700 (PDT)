The team at Vacasa has made it our top priority to make the world of vacation rentals a simple, stress-free experience for both owners and guests. Vacasa offers professional rental management for more than 2,300 vacation homes in some of the most desirable vacation destinations in the U.S. and Central America. From laid-back beach cottages along the Oregon Coast to luxury ski chalets in Vail to tropical getaways in Belize, Vacasa offers just the right retreat for any guest.

In today's busy world, a vacation is a precious opportunity to relax and reconnect with loved ones. Spending that valuable time in a real live home can be especially rewarding, from cooking breakfast together each morning to relaxing by the fireplace every night. Our mission is simple: to make vacation rentals easy.

Vacasa offers the unique combination of professional management in privately-owned homes, making it possible for our guests to enjoy a one-of-a-kind vacation experience without compromising on service and convenience. Our team of passionate hospitality professionals is the finest in the industry, with each Vacasa team member (from housekeepers to reservations agents to local managers) working hard to ensure that each home and every guest is well cared for.

Vacasa is also committed to giving back to the local communities where we manage vacation homes. Our community efforts range from providing academic scholarships for local students to sponsoring special events, and we're always looking for new ways to support the wonderful people and places that make our success possible.

#Pathname:/faq/
Q: How old do I need to be to reserve a home?

A: In order to reserve one of our vacation homes everyone who is traveling must be at least 21 years old or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. In some areas, the age requirement may be higher. Please give us a call at 503-345-9399 for more information.

Q: Do infants count toward the maximum occupancy?

A: Generally, children under the age of 2 do not count toward the maximum occupancy.

Q: Can I bring my dog along?

A: Dogs are allowed in many of our homes. Prior to bringing your dog, you must check with Vacasa and pay the required nightly pet fee.

Q: What is the difference between FlipKey/VRBO and your site?

A: VRBO/FlipKey/HomeAway are advertising sites. We are the property management company that manages everything from marketing to maintenance and housekeeping. We advertise on VRBO and other sites to get our homes the most visibility.

Q: Can I bring more people than the maximum allowed listed?

A: Maximum occupancy does not only refer to the number a home can sleep, this is also the number of people allowed in the home at any given time. It is determined by the licensing authority based on the number of exits in the home and fire safety evacuation plan. Some counties or HOA's have codes that are strictly enforced. Please abide by the maximum occupancy number for the home at all times.

Q: What does Trip Protection cover? Is there a time-frame as to when I can add trip protection?

A: If Trip Protection is purchased, you will receive a full refund for any nights of your reservation cancelled due to a death in the family, illness, flight delays, flight cancellations, or road closures due to bad weather. You can add Trip Protection up to 30 days prior to your reservation. If you are booking and your check-in date is already within 30 days into your reservation, Trip Protection may only be added within 24 hours from the time of booking.

Q: I tried to book a reservation online but it gave me an error. How do I know my reservation is secured?

A: When booking online, if you hit the submit button more than once this will result in you receiving an error message that says either your dates are unavailable or that you already have a reservation. Typically the reservation goes through, but you are welcome to call us at 503-345-9399 to confirm.

Q: Can I get a breakdown of the total cost?

A: The rental quote includes all lodging, taxes, and fees. The breakdown of the total cost is in the green box on the website if you book the reservation online at vacasa.com. Simply click the green box to get the breakdown.

Q: What is Vacasa's cancellation policy?

A: You may cancel within the first 24 hours of booking the reservation with a full refund. Rental payments (less a 5% processing fee) are refundable up until 30 days prior to the reservation. We are unable to offer refunds on reservations cancelled within 30 days of the check-in date unless you purchase our optional Trip Protection plan and the reason for cancellation falls within the trip protection guidelines.

Q: What is the pet policy?

A: Pets are permitted in selected homes, depending on owner preferences. Some owners may have pet allergies and we ask that you only bring your pets into pet-friendly homes. The standard fee is $10 per pet, per night, with a minimum rate of $40 per reservation. The pet maximum and fee may vary by unit and will be listed on the home's webpage.

Q: Do you have any homes without a two night minimum stay?

A: Most of our homes have at least a two night minimum stay. We do have some condos and studios that allow for a one night stay and they should appear when searching for your dates.

Q: Do you take partial payments or must I pay in full upon booking?

A: All reservations under $2000 must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 but within 60 days of check-in must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 with partial payments and more than 60 days out must be paid in full 30 days before the start date of the reservation.

Q: Do you allow weddings in your homes?

A: Some of our homes do allow weddings with the owner's approval. Depending on the home, there may be additional fees, parking restrictions and guest count maximums. Please call us at 503-345-9399 for more details.

Q: How can I modify my reservation, and are there any fees associated with that?

A: Please call us at 503-345-9399 to help you modify your reservation. There could be additional fees depending on the change occurring, but we will walk you through everything before finalizing it.

Q: Do you have monthly rates for your homes?

A: The maximum number of nights one of our homes can be booked for is 29. Therefore, we do not offer monthly rates. The rates for our homes vary based on day of the week, local events, and season.

Q: I found a better unit than the one I booked, would I be able to modify my reservation and change it to the new unit?

A: It is possible to switch homes as long as the change is made more than 30 days prior to the reservation. If the modification results in a higher rental rate guests are responsible for paying the difference. Reservations can be modified without penalty up to 24 hours from making the reservation.

Q: Would I need to sign a rental contract for renting a vacation rental?

A: By booking a reservation, guests acknowledge and agree to abide by Vacasa's rental policies. Some of our homes will require you to sign a reservation contract agreeing to policies that are specific to that home. We ask that you review and sign the contract and return it to us via email or fax.

Q: How do I go about booking a vacation as a gift for a friend?

A: You can book and pay for a reservation for another person. However, you must ensure that the name and all contact information listed on the reservation, including the email address, are for the person that will be staying in the home.

Q: What is the difference between a hotel and a vacation rental?

A: All of our vacation rentals are owned by private home-owners and can be preferable to hotels for a number of reasons. They are typically more comfortable, offer kitchens for preparing meals and are more accommodating to those traveling with children and/or pets. Vacation rentals also offer a wider variety of accommodations which enables them to fit any vacation need, be that a mountain home for 25 or a beach cottage for 2.

Q: How do I pay for a reservation?

A: We accept the following credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express. We also accept electronic checks for reservations booked more than 30 days in advance.

Q: Is smoking allowed in the home?

A: Smoking is prohibited on the rented premises.

Q: Does the home come with linens and towels, or do I need to bring my own?

A: The home will be equipped with all the basic necessities. All the beds will be made with fresh linens and bath towels will be provided. If you would like beach towels, we recommend bringing those with you.

Q: What items can I expect to find in the home?

A: Please see the features and amenities section of the home listing. Vacasa also provides a few items to get you started, including: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, and small trash can liners. If there is something specific that you require, please make sure you bring it with you.

Q: What cable package does the home have? Will we be able to watch the game?

A: Rental properties are individually owned and each home will have a different cable vs streaming option. Vacasa cannot guarantee Television service or TV Channel availability.

Q: If I want to order the UFC Fight, a movie, or a game can I do so and have it charged to my credit card on file?

A: Our homes generally do not provide any sort of pay-per-view service.

Q: How do I obtain the keys?

A: We will e-mail check-in instructions 7 days prior to your stay including driving directions and the code to the lock box or electronic deadbolt.

Q: The lockbox only has one set of keys. Can we get another set?

A: We prefer the keys stay in the lockbox so that each member of your party can access the home at any time. This will eliminate the need for multiple key sets. It also prevents the keys from getting lost.

Q: There are two lockboxes here. Am I using the right one?

A: The lockbox closest to the door or on top is usually the guest lockbox. The other one is for our cleaning and maintenance staff. Occasionally the plates get swapped. If you are having trouble getting in using the code, try it on the other lockbox.

Q: Can I not pay the cleaning fee if I clean the home myself, rather than using your cleaning services?

A: No. Guests are not allowed to clean after their own stay. Our housekeepers meet very strict guidelines and are required to clean the home after each guest vacates.

Q: We've run out of toilet paper. Can you bring us some more?

A: Vacasa provides a starter kit of supplies only. If you think you will need more than what is provided, please make sure to bring some with you.

Q: We can't find any paper towels or dishwashing detergent. Can you bring us some?

A: Please check in all cabinets (under the sink, above the refrigerator) and if you cannot find what you are looking for, we will gladly reimburse you for picking some up. The same goes for the following items: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, small trash can liners, and propane for the grill.

Q: We can't get the fireplace/internet/hot tub/etc. working. Are there instructions in the house?

A: You should have received an email from us with check-in instructions that includes a link to a digital guest binder. With your reservation number, you will have access to all your house instructions. However, if no instructions are found or if you need further assistance please contact one of our Customer Service Agents at 503-345-9399.

Q: I am allergic to pet dander and other smells, but I want to stay in a pet friendly home. Is there any way to ensure that I won't be bothered by them for my stay?

A: All our homes are thoroughly cleaned after each stay. However, we are unable to guarantee that you will not have a reaction to a home that has been regularly occupied by pets.

Q: What are the check-out procedures?

A: Check-out is at 11AM and upon your departure we ask that you start the first load of laundry if there is a washer and dryer in the home. If you have time to begin a second load it is greatly appreciated by our housekeeping staff. A $75 per hour fee will be assessed for failing to vacate the unit by the agreed upon check-out time.

Q: Do I have to check in by a certain time?

A: Check-in is at 4 PM and guests can arrive any time after. There are some cases when early check-in is available. If that is the case, we will email you the morning of your stay to inform you that an early check-in option is available. Please note that we will not be able to confirm or deny an early check in request prior to the day of check in due to our cleaning schedules.

Q: Do you allow early check-ins?

A: An early check-in is dependent on whether or not the housekeeper has time to fully clean the home before your arrival. If guests are checking out the same day that your reservation begins, an early check-in is not allowed as it will not allow the housekeeper enough time to fully prepare the home for you. We will email you the morning of your check-in if early check-in is available.

Q: Can I get a late check out?

A: Late check-out is available if we do not have another reservation that night. There is a fee (plus taxes) associated. The fee varies from house to house. We can tell you if a late check-out is available three days before check-in. If you pay for late check-out you will have the home until midnight the day you check-out.

Q: What is your lost and found policy?

A: We will return your lost item to you if you call us within two weeks of your departure date. We do charge a $25 fee, plus shipping to cover the cost of labor, drive time, and postal fees. Any items not claimed within two weeks will be donated to a local charity.

If an employee thinks a process could be easier or more efficient, they are encouraged to talk to their manager and take ownership to drive change in that area and each employee is asked to support the changes their teammates are driving in other areas.

When Eric and his wife Alia took responsibility for caring for Alia's family’s summer home, he learned firsthand how much work vacation homes can really be. And when he discovered there wasn’t a professional management company on the West Coast that could provide the services he was looking for, he decided to start one? and that’s how Vacasa was born. Today, the family's Long Beach, Washington cottage is one of over 1900 Vacasa homes spread throughout the globe - and our motto remains “vacation rentals made easy”.

Problem-solving, creativity, and openness: that’s our founder, CEO, and fearless leader in a nutshell. Eric has always driven Vacasa with his strong vision, but he’s also made it a priority to empower employees to help shape the company and their roles within it. Eric's conversations with Vacasa employees often start with three questions: “What do you like most about your job? What are you best at? OK, how can you spend more of your time doing that?”

Eric lives in Boise with his wife Alia and their two sons, Rhys and Rowen. He bikes to work daily, runs year-round, spends the summer mountain-biking, and spends the winter skiing - either backcountry, or in-bounds with his three year old son Rhys. And during Eric?s considerable travel to Vacasa destinations across the Western US, he stays in vacation rentals - to spend as much time as possible with friends, family, and employees.

Cliff is Vacasa’s co-founder, Chief Development Officer, and the most good-natured attorney you’ll ever meet. While still a member in good standing with the Colorado and California State Bars, Cliff’s role at Vacasa has always been more about relationship-building.

Since he first joined Eric at his kitchen table to launch Vacasa back in 2009, Cliff has overseen the expansion of our family of Vacasa home owners. Today, he leads our business development team with his obvious passion for connecting with our owners and sharing how Vacasa can make their lives easier.

Cliff lives in Southeast Portland with his wife Kate and their lab/pit mix Muddy, adopted from Portland's Pixie Project. In addition to his role at Vacasa, Cliff serves as a board member for Eugene-based MAPLE Microdevelopment. He has also completed the Eugene Marathon in 2012 and 2013 as part of a benefit for MAPLE, and he has produced, directed, and acted in several theatrical productions from Boston to Denver... and Cliff leads Vacasa’s Portland kickball team (although we don’t hold our abysmal 2014 record against him).

Kimberly’s current title is Vice-President of Operations, but she’s worn a lot of hats since being hired in 2010 as Vacasa’s third-ever employee. Today, she applies her attention to detail and hands-on leadership style to nearly all the areas she previously worked in: housekeeping, property management, maintenance, owner services, and guest experience.

With a professional background in interior design, Kimberly’s been known to rearrange furniture constantly (her own, her friends’, whomever doesn’t try too hard to stop her) and fulfill the Portlandia stereotype by making jewelry on the side.

If you want to talk about numbers, Scott’s listening - or two steps ahead. Since joining Vacasa in 2013, he has introduced our company - and in many ways, the vacation rental industry - to the power of data. From our rate optimization algorithms to the nitty-gritty of our marketing strategy, Scott has helped use data to deliver a better experience to our owners and our guests.

Scott's a tried-and-true Northeast Portlander, where he lives with his wife Lisa and hound dog Juno. He’s been actively involved in community-building, from serving as Chair of the King Neighborhood Association to co-founding the Friends of Last Thursday Art Walk organization. When not crunching numbers or supporting civic functions, you'll find Scott snowboarding on Mt. Hood or exploring the bountiful hikes Oregon provides. Scott also likes to stage his life milestones on mountaintops: he proposed to Lisa on Mount St. Helen’s, and they tied the knot at Skibowl’s warming hut on Mt. Hood.

Erik-with-a-K is our wizard behind the curtain: as CTO since 2011, he oversees all of our in-house technology, from our business applications to our website to our Smart Home Automation systems. And he does it all from his farm in southwest Washington, where he lives with his wife Jenni, daughter Maple, and a menagerie of horses, chickens, geese, dogs, and a guinea pig.

Erik’s professional background and personal interests are centered around open-source hardware and software. His “side project” is Digistump, a company he began after creating three of the most successful Kickstarter projects in the Portland area (Digispark, DigiX, and Digispark Pro). This led to Erik being featured in Steven Osborn’s book “Makers at Work: Folks Reinventing the World One Object or Idea at a Time”. And in his nearly nonexistent free time, Erik continues to be involved in the tech community by serving as an advisor to start-ups like Glowdeck and Brewbot.

#Pathname:/usa/California/Mendocino/
The villages, vineyards, and stunning natural beauty of the Mendocino Coast - or just "the Coast," as locals prefer - make this oceanfront slice of California an unforgettable destination for a laid-back adventure. Mendocino vacation rentals offer you a comfortable and cozy homebase for exploring one of the most remarkable locations on the West Coast.

Three hours north of San Francisco (and just shy of five hours from the Oregon border), you'll find a secluded, arts-minded paradise nestled between old-growth redwood forests and the churning waves of the Pacific Ocean... and there's no better way to experience this region than by living like a local in one of our Mendocino vacation rentals.

The village of Mendocino itself, once a logging boomtown, is now a little quieter and laid-back, with around 1,000 full-time residents. Thanks to the visiting tourists who arrive from the Bay Area on summer weekends, however, you'll find some truly wonderful restaurants, shops, and galleries to keep you entertained throughout your stay. Stop by Patterson's Pub for a pint of local beer and a bowl of clam chowder, or stock up on picnic supplies at Mendocino Market and head for the beach.

The entire coastline around the village is comprised of Mendocino Headlands State Park - the perfect spot for picnics, as well as hiking, beach combing, or simply soaking up the views of the rugged coastline and crashing waves. To get a little closer to the scenic wilderness, pay a visit to the knowledgable folks at Catch a Canoe & Bicycles Too to rent kayak, canoe, or bike for the day. The Big River, which empties into Mendocino Bay just south of town, is ideal for an afternoon of paddling - and Catch a Canoe even specializes in dog-friendly canoes so you can bring your four-legged best friend along for the ride!

The region surrounding Mendocino is full of fodder for excellent day trips. Head south to tiny Elk, California for breakfast the legendary Queenie's Roadhouse Cafe, or stop in Albion for a romantic oceanfront dinner at the Ledford House. Head out for a hike along the gorgeous, redwood-lined Navarro River. Or, drive north along Highway 1, stopping by the beautiful Point Cabrillo lighthouse on the way to funky Fort Bragg.

However you choose to spend your time in Mendocino, it's guaranteed to deliver that unmistakable Northern California sense of laid-back beauty. And Vacasa has the perfect Mendocino lodging in store, from dog-friendly beach houses to luxury country estates. Book one of our Mendocino vacation rentals today, and get your adventure started!

Golfer's Villa at the Resort on the Mountain

From a cozy cabin near the slopes to a nestled-in-the-woods golfside condo, a Mt. Hood vacation rental is the key to a getaway full of uniquely Oregon sights, sounds, tastes, and fun. Including the highest point in the state of Oregon, the Mt. Hood region is a treasure trove of year-round outdoor activities, like skiing, fishing, hiking, and much more.

Starting about 30 miles east of bustling Portland, this region includes the Mt. Hood National Forest, with its Douglas Fir-covered landscape. The Cascade Mountain Range fills out the landscape here, with Mt. Hood being the tallest peak with a height nearing 11,240 feet.

Leaving the Columbia River corridor along the northern Oregon border and heading south on Highway 35 from Hood River, the charming town of Parkdale sits in the midst of the fertile vineyards and orchards of the Hood River Valley. This is also the highway that leads up the northern face of Mt. Hood, so amazing views of its snow-capped peak abound.

Speaking of snow - let's talk about serious skiing! Once you've reached the peak of Mt. Hood, the closest town is the charming alpine village of Government Camp, home to not two but three ski resorts: Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood Skibowl, and Mount Hood Meadows. All are quite popular, but Timberline is perhaps the most famous. Built in the 1930s, its iconic lodge has been used as a location for a number of films including Bend of the River, Lost Horizon, and The Shining. One of the most desirable locations on Mt. Hood, Government Camp is full of convenient ski condos and cozy cabins for travelers who want to stay as close to the slopes as possible!

Highway 26 leads back down the western side of the mountain, and is dotted with charming villages full of riverside cabins and rustic retreats. Nine miles from Government Camp, the outdoor paradise of Rhododendron lies close to five state parks and boasts hiking, boating, rafting, climbing, horseback riding, fishing, and more in the summer. Birding enthusiasts can explore two official Oregon Cascades Birding Trails, while using binoculars, cameras, and sketchbooks to capture scenes of their feathered friends.

Two miles further west, the small, unincorporated village of Zig Zag is a perfect family getaway full of non-stop outdoor adventure, including quiet hikes along the nearby ZigZag River.

A bit of advice - when you come to visit ZigZag's comparatively bustling neighbor, Welches, be sure to bring your clubs! For an amazing golf getaway, you could not pick a better spot, as there are no less than three golf courses in the area. The first course, founded in 1928, was actually the very initial one in Oregon. And if you're up for the challenge of catching your dinner, head to the aptly named Salmon River and spend a sunny afternoon fishing for salmon and steelhead. Like all towns near Mt. Hood, Welches offers many cold weather activities as well, be it a sleigh ride around snowy downtown or just enjoying a cup of hot cocoa back at your cozy condo.

Outdoor enthusiasts will also adore staying in quiet Brightwood, located near the meeting of the Sandy and Salmon Rivers. This little village is a cyclist's dream with 17 bike trails, rated from strenuous to fun-for-everyone. With two rivers winding through town, fishing is also huge here, so make sure to bring your gear or just head to the small downtown's fishing supply store.

Our final destination in this richly diverse region is Molalla, a less popular - and thus less crowded - destination tucked southwest of Mt. Hood along the scenic Molalla River Corridor. In addition to river-related activities like rafting and fishing, this city is also known for its famed "Buckeroo Rodeo", showing off equestrian skills beginning in April and ending in September.

It may be hard to find a more diverse and quintessentially Pacific Northwest region than this one. Book a Mt. Hood vacation rental to discover everything this area has to offer!

Family Home between the Fairways with Views!

That 70's House on the Water

Offering activities, views and unique experiences for every type of traveler, planning a great escape to a Lake Tahoe vacation rental unlocks a world of adventures. Tahoe is more than just the meeting place of California and Nevada; it includes the crystal blue waters of Lake Tahoe, snow-capped mountains, and long hikes through lush natural forests. From lakefront cottages to cozy ski cabins, Tahoe vacation homes offer access to world-class skiing at resorts like Heavenly, Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, and Northstar. Enjoy the sparkling nightlife at area casinos Crystal Bay and Harvey's Resort, and practice your golf swing at any number of greens - Old Brockway, Coyote Moon, or the Bijou, just to name a few.

Foodies also have much to get excited about in this cosmopolitan mountain region. Local eateries showcasing fresh, regional ingredients in a variety of establishments for every taste and mood is the norm. Whether it's a plate of Sierra Powder Sushi Rolls at The Naked Fish in South Lake Tahoe, pints of Manifesto Pale Ale and Chicken Wings at Fifty Fifty Brewing Company in Truckee, or Durham Ranch Filet Mignon at Wolfdale's Cuisine Unique in Tahoe City, everyone will be sure to find something that delights their palette.

Nestled in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Truckee is just a hair west of the Nevada state line. Boasting 270 trails, 43 ski lifts, eight mountain peaks, and six terrain parks, this town is for the true outdoor adventurer. But wait: there's also an abundance of dining options, coffee houses, galleries and shops to satisfy a variety of visitors.  Nearby Northstar-Truckee is home to the famous Northstar Resort, with year-round activities from skiing and snowboarding to golfing and hiking.

Right on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe is Kings Beach, a community brimming with outdoor activities! Kings Beach State Recreation Area has over 700 feet of sandy beach for beachcombing, sand castle building, and just plain relaxing. Close to skiing and fishing as well, there's also casino gambling and entertainment nearby just across the Nevada state line at Crystal Bay.

An outdoor lover's dream, Tahoe Vista is a small community just west of Kings Beach, joined by its charming neighbor, Carnelian Bay. Picture yourself in a cute vacation getaway right near the water in either of these two postcard-perfect spots!

If you like a little more liveliness in your destination, Tahoe City is a vibrant, fun-filled playground right on the lake, with three great beaches - Tahoe City Commons, Tahoe State Recreation Area, and Lake Forest Beach. From here, you can take your pick of activities - enjoy a cruise around the lake, play golf at Tahoe City's historic course, raft the river, or in winter make the short drive to a number of ski resorts.

Just northwest of Tahoe City along Highway 89, Olympic Valley lies on the banks of the Truckee River. Home to Squaw Valley Ski Resort, this is the spot for world-class skiing and snowboarding. With a stay in a cozy ski condo, in addition to all the winter sports, you'll be ideally located to take the aerial tramway 8,200 feet to the resort's High Camp to enjoy dining, swimming in the heated pool, and a spectacular view of the surrounding peaks.

Not too far away, the ski resort towns of Alpine Meadows and Homewood are veritable winter wonderlands. From a private vacation lodge, to a ski-themed condo, these two locations are a great choice for avid winter sports enthusiasts. Just south of Homewood lies Tahoma, an area surrounded by natural scenic wonders. From your cabin in the woods, it's just a short distance to dog-friendly Bliss State Park, with its amazing mountain and lake views. Close by there's also Meeks Bay Resort and Marina, a popular place for water skiing, picnicking, and relaxing on the pristine sandy beach.

What can we say about South Lake Tahoe? There's the restaurants, clubs, and casinos. But then there's also canoeing  on the lake, golfing on a sunny afternoon, and hiking in a grove of pines - all with the backdrop of the majestic Sierra Nevadas. This is a truly unforgettable destination with something special in store for every kind of traveler!

The communities and cities around Lake Tahoe are as diverse as the many different year-round activities available in this scenic outdoor utopia - and we have the perfect Tahoe vacation rental just waiting for your next adventure!

Surrounded by fantastic ski resorts like Park City Mountain Resort, Deer Valley, and The Canyons, and home to world-class dining and shopping, there's something special for everyone to enjoy in this beautiful Utah resort town, and our rentals located in places like Bear Hollow keep you close to the action and surrounded by Northern Utah's impressive landscape. Thanks to its early days as a silver mining boomtown, Park City is full of wonderful Victorian mansions, homes, shops, and hotels - many restored to peak condition after skiers discovered Park City's powder in the 1950s. Since then, Park City has become a world-renowned destination for winter adventures, even hosting many Olympic events during the Salt Lake City games in 2002.

The Chalet at the Lodge at Vail #4

It's no wonder the Vail Valley is one of the top destinations in the country for spending an adventure-packed vacation in cozy ski cabins or luxurious Vail Valley rentals! Boasting the second largest ski mountain in North America, five-star dining, fantastic festivals, countless trailheads, and more natural splendor than your senses can absorb, this premiere Colorado resort region attracts thousands of visitors each year in hopes of experiencing an authentic taste of Rocky Mountain living at its best.

It's surprisingly easy to get around the entire valley with the largest free transportation system in the country. You'll find convenient shuttle bus access near many of our rentals to whisk you away to the heart of Vail - even if you decide to stay in a peaceful cabin rental closer to a rushing river than a bustling ski resort.

For those who do like to keep their finger on the pulse of the town, you won't find a better spot than our luxury vacation ski homes in Vail itself, within walking distance to dozens of hotspots in Vail Village, Golden Peak, and Lionshead. Bavarian-style villages and pedestrian streets exude an Old World charm and host diverse boutiques and dining, from sandwich shops to five-star cuisine. Sunny pub decks invite you to share a mid-day beer, while dance clubs, live music, and karaoke bars bring the village to life once the sun sets. And, of course, the carefully manicured slopes of Vail Mountain are just steps away.

Looking for peace and quiet in your Vail Valley vacation home? Just five miles east, with stunning mountain and valley vistas, over 18 bikes paths, and a plethora of hiking trails just out your front door, our East Vail ski home rentals will provide an ideal gateway to the natural beauty and outside attractions of Vail Valley, without the crowds. Fish along Gore Creek, hike up the six mile trail to awe-inspiring Booth Falls, then take advantage of the hot tubs, pools, steam rooms, and recreation center at the Vail Racquet Club. For the more daring souls, the East Vail Chutes provide difficult terrain and a unique challenge for more advanced skiers. On the other side of town, West Vail was originally an expansion of Vail Resort, but is now a quiet, residential neighborhood. It's only a short drive or free shuttle ride away from the world famous resort, but a vacation rental here is a little less hectic than Vail Village, and ideally situated to exploit both the sunshine from the north, and the scenic alpine vistas from the south.

Head further west and you'll have your choice of not one, but two renowned ski resorts within close reach when you choose from our private vacation homes or condos in the quaint town of Avon, just 10 miles from the Vail slopes, and home to the fabulous Beaver Creek Resort. Known for its upscale and family-friendly accommodations, Beaver Creek Resort is comprised of three villages: Beaver Creek Village, Bachelor's Gulch, and Arrowhead, each connected by catwalks and boasting 25 ski lifts and 1,832 skiable acres. Visitors will enjoy ice skating in the center of the village, art galleries, and plenty of dining and shopping. In the summer, go paddle boarding on Nottingham Lake and don't miss the largest fireworks display over the Colorado Rockies.

Further west and set in a more quiet and residential community, our mountain homes in Eagle-Vail and Edwards will attract those looking for a more peaceful retreat. Located between Avon and Vail in the heart of the Eagle River Valley, Eagle-Vail is home to one of the finest golf courses around at the EagleVail Golf Club, as well as a deluxe public pool in the summer and excellent cross country ski trails in winter. A bit more removed, yet just 10 minutes to Beaver Creek and 20 to Vail, Edwards offers its scenic Riverwalk dotted with boutique shops, a world-class spa, and upscale dining at exquisite bistros and wine bars. Fresh waters, like the nearby Eagle River, will delight fisherman and entice kayakers, rafters and floaters alike.

About 25 miles further west, the small town of Gypsum occupies a prime spot right in the middle of the Rocky Mountains. From a vacation home surrounded by Red Mountain and Tenmile Peak, explore miles and miles of off-roading, hiking and biking trails, and cross-country and snowshoeing the backcountry in winter.

Choose your perfect vacation rental from our large selection of Vail Valley ski rentals including homes, cabins, and condos to discover how each of these charming mountain towns offer its own vantage point and unique access to the bountiful recreation activities throughout the White River National Forest that awaits each season.

Belize is known for its laid-back attitude, diverse ecosystems, and ample adventure opportunities, which all combine to form a wonderful vacation destination! Bordered to the north by Mexico, the south and west by Guatemala, and the east by the Caribbean Sea, Belize is one of the top travel spots in Central America.

There's a ton to love about Belize, but perhaps its biggest attraction is the beautiful beach. With hundreds of miles of coastline, you can relax while strolling barefoot along the soft sand - working only on your tan! You could also explore the coastal mangrove swamps or rent some snorkeling or scuba gear and dive underwater to discover the sea life around the Belize Barrier Reef. With more than 450 small offshore islands, an abundance of fresh seafood, and some of the most scenic coastline in the world, the shores of Belize may just be the perfect place for a beach getaway. Spots like Placencia exemplify Belize's laid-back, picture-perfect beach getaways!

Things to Do in Belize

If you prefer to seek out adventures, the interior of the country has many tantalizing options. The pristine, sunny beaches of the coast quickly give way to a rainforest-type atmosphere that is teeming with life and excitement. In the western Cayo District, you will find dense hardwood forests with hidden waterfalls, mysterious caves, and hundreds of species of wildlife. This jungle is an ideal place to enjoy a breathtaking hike through the trees, kayak down a river, go spelunking, or take a scenic guided horseback ride. Belize still has a prominent Mayan influence, but for a real taste of history you will enjoy taking a daytrip to numerous Mayan ruins, including Caracol, Xunantunich, Altun Ha, and Lamanai, where you can marvel at the architectural feats and dream of days past.

Eco-tourism brings many visitors to Belize, and the country is well-known for its toucans, tapirs, and monkeys. It even features the world's premier jaguar refuge at Cockscomb Basin. A large portion of the wilderness is protected, so the land is as unspoiled - and as beautiful - as possible. With a low human population density and a huge expanse of jungle, plants and animals truly thrive here.

The Christophe at River Run - The Executive

The Christophe at River Run - The Maven

Greyhawk at the Ski Lifts -The Artisan

A Sun Valley vacation rental is the perfect location for world-class skiing, snowboarding, fly fishing, rafting on the Salmon River, hiking, biking, snowshoeing and so much more. But besides being an ideal location for almost any outdoor adventure you could dream of, you'll also be surrounded by galleries, shops, a thriving arts scene, and wonderful eateries right in town! All that, plus over 200 days of sunshine a year! Interested?

Start with a cozy ski in/ski out condo in the cosmopolitan, resort-town of Sun Valley for a fun family vacation. Then hit the slopes at Dollar Mountain for beginner to intermediate runs, cross-country skiing at the Sun Valley Nordic and Snowshoe Center, and even holiday sleigh rides your whole group will enjoy. Of course, the more experience skier may want to check out the action at Bald Mountain, with its 3,400 vertical feet of slopes - but that mountain is just on the other side of town!

Now, don't go thinking that Sun Valley is just for winter. In nice weather, take a trip up the ski lifts and mountain bike down on dirt trails past wildflowers. Or gear up and check out trout fishing on some of the world's best fly fishing streams. With some luck, later you'll be sitting down to a perfectly cooked Trout Almondine in your comfortable Sun Valley vacation rental!

Like Sun Valley, nearby Ketchum (it's less than two miles southwest) is sandwiched between Bald and Dollar Mountains and right by all the resort action, but Ketchum is also a bustling little town in its own right. Set against snow-capped mountains, sparkling freshwater streams, funky galleries and shops downtown, with a lot of bright, year-round sunshine. A four season destination just like its neighbor to the northeast, it's the ideal location for vacation lodging like a golf condo or a cabin  in town.

In summer, its bright sun and warm afternoons make Ketchum a prime setting for a round of golf. Just north of downtown, the Bigwood Golf Course is a 9 hole, par 36 course and nearby, the Sun Valley Resort Golf Course has 18 holes for your tee off enjoyment. And after your game, head back to your Ketchum vacation home to lounge on the deck with a glass of wine before walking to the charming downtown for a delicious dinner out. If you visit in July, you may be able to check out the Ketchum Arts Festival, with over 100 artist booths, live music, food, and kids' activities.

Like many of the great Western ski towns, Sun Vally and Ketchum have it all - excitement, beautiful scenery, and lots to do, but here you'll find it all at an unhurried, laid back pace. So, leave the lines behind and pick your perfect Sun Valley condo or Ketchum cottage from our growing list of Sun Valley / Ketchum vacation rentals and start exploring the beautiful, central Idaho mountains.

Arrow Point, Lake Coeur d'Alene Views At Their Best

Boasting an incredible variety of activities, our Coeur d'Alene vacation rentals have something for everyone - from a sleek and modern condo in the city, near galleries, restaurants, and shopping to a cozy cabin in the wilderness, where you can fish, hike, and enjoy being surrounded by nature.

You'll be able to take in all the sights - lakes, the Coeur d'Alene National Forest, and even a segment of the northern Rocky Mountains (the Bitterroot Range) from here. This part of the Idaho Panhandle will definitely delight vacationers with a wide range of activities and multitude of incredible landscapes. There's even a blossoming North-Central Idaho wine region for wine connoisseurs to discover, a movement led by Coeur d'Alene Cellars, a small, family-owned winery.

Where to start your northern Idaho adventure? Couer d'Alene itself is much smaller than its big city neighbors towards the west coast, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in style. From a swanky, modern condo downtown, you'll have a prime location for the monthly Second Friday Artwalk, numerous dining options, a cruise on Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Sunday Market, even a relaxing afternoon at Spa Coeur d'Alene. And if you hear the call of the outdoors,  you're still close to skiing at Silver Mountain Resort, the 24 mile, multi-use Centennial Trail, and kayaking out on the lake.

A mere 37 miles south of Coeur d'Alene, lies quaint and historic Harrison, a terrific choice for a cycle-centric getaway. Home to a spot along the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes, a 72 miles paved trail that goes all the way from Mullan by the Montana border, through Harrison, and straight on west to Plummer, near Washington. In addition, outdoor adventurers will have parks, trails, and lakes to explore, jog, hike, and boat. A charming Harrison cabin in the woods puts you right in the middle of the great outdoors, but still near an historic downtown with a small selection of shops, galleries, and eateries.

North of Coeur d'Alene, only six miles to be exact, is another small town full of Idaho charm. Hayden, right near scenic Lake Hayden, is your home base for enticing getaway packed full of water sports like fishing, jet skiing, and boating, to more leisurely activities like golfing, or just plain relaxing on the front porch. From your Haden vacation home, you'll be right near over 40 miles of shoreline, as well as only a short car ride from all the action in bustling Coeur d'Alene to the south.

On your next Pacific Northwest vacation, you may just want to head a bit inland to Idaho. Whether you choose a modern retreat in the city, a quiet lakefront cabin, or a condo on the edge of a meticulously manicured golf course, a stay in a Coeur d'Alene vacation rental will leave you counting down the days until your return to this beautiful, full-of-surprises Idaho destination!

The Best Little Beach House on the Oregon Coast!

Spending time in one of our Oregon Coast vacation rentals is the perfect way to experience this spectacular region, from cooking freshly-caught crab in your own kitchen to relaxing in a luxurious oceanfront hot tub! The hardest choice may be deciding which bustling coastal town or quiet oceanside neighborhood to call home during your visit.

Just don't even think about calling it "the beach". To Oregonians (both natives and transplants), all 363 miles of rocky cliffs, white sandy shores, and unbelievably panoramic views lining the Pacific Ocean is simply known as "the coast". And Oregon loves her coast. Since 1967, the entire stretch has been preserved as free, publicly accessible land, essentially creating one incredibly diverse public park that includes bustling seaports, windswept sand dunes, pine-covered cliffs, and romantic lighthouses... and there's no better way to experience this region like a local than by staying in one of our Oregon Coast beach rentals.

The coast is informally divided into three sections: north, central, and south. The northern coast stretches from historic Astoria on the Columbia River to Cascade Head, a prominent headland jutting out into the ocean just south of Neskowin. In between, the well-traveled region is home to many of the coast's most popular tourist destinations: bustling Seaside, charming Cannon Beach, and the famous cheese factory of Tillamook. Families and fishermen alike flock to scenic Rockaway Beach.

For those seeking peace and quiet, smaller villages like Manzanita, Oceanside, Arch Cape, and Netarts offer a more laid-back pace of life. Quintessential northern coast experiences include exploring the tidepools at Haystack Rock, photographing historic lighthouses along the scenic Three Capes Drive, and stopping for the state's freshest seafood in a fishing village like Barview or Garibaldi. Don't miss the fresh pints at the Pelican Pub and Brewery and lively dory boats at beautiful Pacific City.

The central Oregon coast is wildly diverse, encompassing state parks perched along rugged cliffs and tourist towns dotting sandy beaches before giving way to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. One of the most popular destinations for Oregon beach vacation rentals, bustling Lincoln City in the north draws thousands of visitors with its dining scene, casinos, and shopping, along with a long stretch of gorgeous sandy beach. Heading south along Highway 101, the central coast includes the Whale Watching Capital of the Oregon Coast at Depoe Bay, the lively harbor of Newport and its famous aquarium (not to mention the Rogue brewery), and world-class crabbing in Waldport. Scenic Cape Perpetua soars above the ocean for some of the coast's finest views and clifftop hikes, while further south, the towering sand dunes make for a delightful summer playground and the town of Yachats boasts a lively arts scene and some excellent dining options.

The southern Oregon coast is much further from the state's population centers of Portland, Salem, and Eugene, and accordingly is much less traveled. After bustling Coos Bay, the southern coast is dotted with only a few small towns along the miles of sandy coastline stretching down to California. Visitors to this region often make the pilgrimage to the famous courses at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, take a jet boat ride up the Rogue River, or simply find their private stretch of beach and soak up the southern coast's more abundant sunshine.

Whether you stay in a luxurious oceanfront estate or one of our charming Oregon Coast yurts, your stay in this beautiful destination will certainly leave you feeling relaxed and rejuvenated!

#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/chile/
Chile’s unique landscape—situated between the endless Pacific coastline and the towering Andes Mountains—fill this South American country with major bucket-list items worth checking off! About 17.3 million people live in this beautiful and diverse nation, with the bustling capital of Santiago home to about six million. Whether you’re learning the Cueca (the national dance), climbing a massive volcano overlooking a bright blue lake, or kicking around at the locals’ fútbol game, Chile provides endless options for cultural and outdoor activity. Through a history of mixing of European colonization and indigenous people, this part of South America has a unique culture, language, and landscape that's all its own.

Bordering Peru and characterized by the Atacama Desert, the Norte Grande (far north) of Chile is best known for its extreme climates. The Atacama Desert, a plateau that runs east from the Andes, is so arid that it’s known as the “driest place on earth” – most of it receives barely an inch of rain per year, and some places haven’t seen a drop for centuries. Besides its reputation for dryness, the Norte Grande also boasts spectacular scenery like salt flats, geysers, volcanoes, and coastal bluffs. Many types of vegetation and animals grow and thrive north of the Atacama near the Loa River and surrounding valley. Chile’s most precious copper, nitrate, and silver deposits and mines are also found in Norte Grande and worth seeing, especially the Chuquicamata, which is the biggest open-pit copper mine in the world. Antofagasta, the largest city in this region, has incredible coastal views and an economy based on the port activity and minerals found nearby.

Just south of the Norte Grande region is Norte Chico (the near north), which stretches from the southern border of the Atacama to just above the capital city of Santiago. Home to Chile’s highest peak, a stratovolcano named Ojos del Salado, as well as Laguna Verde (its ultra-famous lake), this region is mountainous and has distinct valley ranges that run all the way from the Andes to the Pacific Coast. The climate is a bit more forgiving than its northern neighbor, with moderate temperatures and more rainfall. The Elqui Valley is the most famous part of the Norte Chico, ideal for cattle-raising and growing fruit, and almost all Pisco (the ubiquitous and delicious Chilean brandy) is grown here. On the western coast, high bluffs that overlook the Pacific form more distinct microclimates, and La Serena is popularly for its beautiful beaches.

Known as the “heartland” of Chile with the largest urban areas and rich agricultural resources, the Zona Central is a beautiful and diverse region to visit. Home to the Central Valley (located between the Andes to the east and the coastal mountain ranges west), this area has a fertile Mediterranean climate ideal for growing fresh fruits, grapes for wine, and other agricultural exports. There’s great alpine skiing in the Andes due to higher precipitation, and there are also lush old-growth forests and national parks to the south. Four incredible urban areas call the Zona Central home: the capital of Santiago, the populous Concepción, and the colorful coastal cities of Valparaíso and Viña del Mar. The Zona Central holds about two-thirds of the country’s population, and for good reason!

Reaching from the waters of the Río Bío-Bío in the north to the Isla de Chiloé in the south, the Zona Sur is known as the “lake district” of Chile. With the rugged backdrop of the Andes mountains to the west, there are numerous turquoise lakes that spot the horizon amidst snow-covered volcanoes and green farmlands. Adrenaline-pumping adventure sport meccas beckon tourists from all over the world to the Zona Sur with tons of hiking, kayaking, volcano-scaling, and snowboarding options abound. Pucón and Puerto Varas are known for their sports-centric audiences, while Temuco, Valdivia, and Osorno hold most of the region’s population.

Perhaps the most spectacular yet extreme part of Chile, the Zona Austral offers a variety of landscapes all the way from the glaciers of Patagonia down to Punta Arenas, the largest and southernmost city on the planet. Much of the Zona Austral is not properly explored, providing exciting and untouched landscape for thousands of miles. The gorgeous granite peaks of Torres del Paine National Park are rightfully a well-known destination in this region of the Chilean Patagonia bordering Argentina, and a series of snow-capped mountains and volcanoes lead down to the coastline. Thousands of islands surround the coast off of Punta Arenas and Tierra del Fuego, including the well-known Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez.

Whether you're braving the heat of the sprawling Atacama Desert in the north or hitting the Andes for some world-class skiing and snowboarding in the south, the diverse and stunning country of Chile offers something for people of all ages and backgrounds to enjoy. With the popularity of outdoor sporting options and a rich, diverse language and culture, find out for yourself why this country is quickly becoming a top tourist destination with a stay in one of our Chile vacation rentals!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Australia/
It's been called the land Down Under, OZ, and Great Southern Land. Immortalized in book, music, and film, Australia beguiles the senses with beautiful coastal beaches, verdant valleys, snow-capped peaks, and a savage and majestic interior. With only 23 million people in a country approximately the size of the United States, there's plenty of space to roam as wild and free as the land. From cosmopolitan Sydney to chic Melbourne to trendy Brisbane to laid back Perth, our Australia vacation rentals will place you in a holiday mindset the minute you walk through the door!

First sighted by Europeans in 1606 and first settled more than 150 years later, Australia has a unique and somewhat turbulent history. Established as a British penal colony - many modern-day Aussies proudly trace their lineage back to the original convicts - the country became a gold rush and agricultural mecca in the 1800s, increasing the population tenfold. Today, Australia's demographics are as diverse as the country itself. You'll find Asian, Greek, and Eastern European businesses in many of the big cities.

Abutting the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Australia is a land of sharp contrasts across seven unique territories. The eastern territories - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania - features sun-kissed beaches, green valleys, and majestic rivers. While the central and western territories - South Australia, Northern Territory, and Western Australia - boast rugged landscapes and laid back cities.

New South Wales is the most popular state and the one that gets the most foreign visitors. Sydney boasts beautiful beaches filled with beautiful people - Bondi Beach is a can't-miss stop! Don't forget to dine at one of the Michelin-starred restaurants or take in a performance at the iconic Sydney Opera House. Throughout New South Wales you'll find plentiful beaches and friendly small towns, from blink-and-you'd-miss-it Bungowannah to surfing mecca Wollongong to koala paradise Port Macquarie.

?Queenland is the state of sunshine and surf, with gorgeous coastal hamlets and a vibrant surfing culture. Brisbane is the largest city and features 12 months of sunshine, as well as beautiful parks, art galleries, and an increasingly hip populace. The Sunshine Coast is just 64 miles to the north, offering exactly what it describes. Cairns is your entry to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the most pristine natural wonders of the world. Grab your snorkel gear and make sure to take pictures since it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience!

Heading south and to the west, you'll come across stately Victoria. Chic Melbourne is known for its world-renowned fashion houses and cultural offerings, including the Victorian Arts Centre and the Australian Ballet. Victoria (and part of New South Wales) is also home to the Australian Alps, the only snow-capped areas in the country and the land's sole ski destination.

Tasmania is the island off the island, featuring unique flora and fauna - don't worry, the Tasmanian Devil won't hurt you - and a host of festivals throughout the year. The capital, Hobart, is the second oldest in the country and is a popular port for ships of all varieties, although most specifically for scientists heading to Antarctic bases. The city is also known for its well-preserved Georgian and Victorian architecture.

The center of the country is as beautiful and awe-inspiring as the coastal portions! South Australia is known for its 18 world-class wine regions, most notably the Barossa Valley. Make a day of savoring the award-winning Shiraz and Colombard! Regal Adelaide boasts numerous dance companies, as well as a love for Aussie Rules Football, rugby, cricket, and even basketball.

Head north and you'll enter the Northern Territory, the least populated of the Aussie states and one of the most ethnically diverse. You'll find numerous national parks within its half million square miles. The capital of Darwin is tropical in climate and relaxed in nature! Most of the population lives along the Stuart Highway in the towns of Palmerston, Alice Springs, Katherine, Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek. Hop on the legendary Ghan railway, one of the most epic train journeys in the world. The locomotive traverses nearly 1,900 miles of desert terrain from Darwin to Adelaide. Stop off in Alice Springs and head to Uluru (Ayers Rock), the red monolith sacred to the Aboriginals. You'll find springs, rock caves, and paintings at this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Western Australia is the largest territory in the country and is so wild and untamed that few reside outside of the Southwestern border. Much of the interior has been unfortunately abused by farmers, leading to its designation as a biodiversity hotspot. Perth is the largest city, with arts organizations aplenty and a strong local music scene. The town of Freemantle features many well-preserved 19th century buildings.

From sea to shining sea, Australia enchants and our Australia vacation rentals are the best choice in holiday accommodations in this mesmerizing land!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Mexico/
A land of ancient ruins, bustling metropolises, sandy beaches, and hospitable people, Mexico has lured travelers for many centuries. A confluence of Meso-American and European culture, Mexico enthralls thanks to its colonial architecture, vast plateaus and mountains, and the majestic Rio Grande. Our gorgeous Mexico vacation rentals are a great base from which to explore this proud and beguiling land, from sea to shining sea.

Encompassing nearly 760,000 square miles, Mexico is as complex and varied as its people and history. The Mayans, Toltecs, Aztecs, and Spainards have all laid claim to its vast riches and you can see remnants of these ancient civilizations in places such as Teotihuacan, Chichen Itza, Monte Alban, and Tulum. "New Spain," as it was called for nearly 300 years, is responsible for the lovely colonial cities of Puebla and Zacatecas as well as numerous cathedrals and forts scattered throughout the country. During this time, Mexico introduced the world to tequila and what has become the most popular ethnic cuisine in the United States, both of which you can enjoy from your Mexico vacation rental.

Mexico abuts the Pacific Ocean, and the west coast affords visitors many quaint small and large towns along nearly 4,600 miles of coastline, from the Baja peninsula to the border of Guatemala. Head to Cabo if you're into tony resorts and celeb sightings. Puerto Vallarta still appeals to lovers - 50 years after Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton put it on the map - thanks to soft breezes, white sand, and lush orchids. Acapulco, the "Pearl of the Pacific," is just that: a shining jewel filled with charming cliffside restaurants and secluded beaches. The Michoacan Coast, between Nayarit and Oaxaca, boasts secluded beaches and coves amid mango and papaya groves. Punta Mita features many luxury resorts as well as restaurants catering to the jet set. Costalegre is truly the "Coast of Joy," thanks to an abundance of picturesque sleepy fishing villages.

Heading west, you'll encounter Mexico's capital and one of the largest cities in the world. With nearly nine million residents, Mexico City is a bustling financial capital but still retains a bit of vintage appeal. The neighborhood of San Angel, just five miles south of the city center, boasts cobblestone streets, Colonial-era architecture, and a variety of world-class museums. Xochimilco is another appealing Colonial-era gem, thanks to its floating gardens, brick streets, and 50 miles of canals. Condesa and Roma, two adjacent neighborhoods, are famous for their hipster vibe - think Williamsburg meets St. Germain - as well as their Art Deco buildings.

Further west towards the Gulf of Mexico, you'll find bustling resort towns with a decidedly more American flavor than those on the Pacific rim. From colonial resplendent Merida to the shopper's mecca of Playa del Carmen, the Yucatan Peninsula boasts myriad places to savor Mexican hospitality. Explore the Gran Museo del Mundo Maya in Merida before heading to the Mayan ruins in Uxmal. Playa del Carmen plays host to many a cruise ship so don't be surprised if you spy boat loads of tourists at the pre-Colombian walled city of Tulum (40 miles away) or the Sian Ka'an biosphere reserve (86 miles away), a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Regardless of which of our Mexico vacation rentals you choose to stay in, you'll be sure to enjoy the sun, sites, and flavors of Mexico.
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Panama/
The land of "abundant fish, trees, and butterflies" is also the land of abundant sunshine, mountains, rainforests, beaches, and friendly locals! From cosmopolitan Panama City to coffee-centric Boquete to quaint El Valle de Antón, Panama is a country of sharp contrasts and cultural diversity.

More than 12 percent of the people are indigenous, with a large segment of the rest being of Afro-Antillean or Chinese origin. The food is a confluence of these cultures, as is the music and the colorful native dress, the pollera. Dance with other revelers during Carnaval in Panama City, or celebrate the Fiesta de San Juan Bautista in Chitré. Whatever you choose, our Panama vacation rentals are a great place to call home in this beguiling land.

Like other Caribbean nations, Panamanian culture is a mix of African, Native American and European influences, making it an appealing travel destination for anyone looking for urbanity and tradition. Pre-Columbian cultures included the Chibchan, Chocoan and Cueva peoples, all hunter gatherers. Once the Spanish arrived in 1501, courtesy of Rodrigo de Bastidas, the country became an economic and strategic powerhouse. Spain ruled for more than 300 years, using the tiny nation as a gateway to the lucrative Orient. Today it remains a gateway from west to east, thanks to the impressive Panama Canal.

The nation's capital, Panama City, is an international banking center divided into corregimientos, or quarters, with the old quarter attracting the most visitors thanks to its well-preserved colonial architecture and myriad old churches and plazas. Explore Panama Viejo, the old capital just minutes from downtown Panama City. This UNESCO World Heritage Site includes the ruins of the first Spanish city on the Pacific.

Heading out of the capital, visitors will come across white sand beaches, lush rainforests, and a plethora of coffee plantations. The Archipelago de Bocas del Toro is on Panama's west coast border with Costa Rica. Sink your feet in the white sand or explore a hidden cove on a lazy summer day. The Archipelago de San Blas is old-school Panama with nary a condo or mall in sight, but plenty of palm trees, soft sand and turquoise water. The uninhabited Cayos Los Grullos, Holandeses, and Ordupuquip are popular with yachters and off-the-beaten-track types. Playa Coronado is just one hour away from Panama City, and boasts white powder and big city conveniences. Playa Barqueta near the town of David is popular with surfers and turtle-hatching enthusiasts.

Near the Costa Rican border lies the province of Chiriquí. Mountains give way to beautiful valleys and waterfalls. Head up to the small town of Boquete, famous for its coffee. Many of the area's producers - some of the world's best - host tours and tastings throughout the year. A thriving expat community in town means more chances to go river rafting, hiking, or biking near Volcán Barú, the country's highest point.

A stay in one of our Panama vacation rentals isn't complete without a journey into the country's intriguing and dynamic interior. The provinces of Veraguas, Los Santos, Herrera, and Cocle offer a pleasing variance to the popular coastal towns. Isla Colba, a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its pristine rainforests, sits in the Pacific and is a draw for scuba divers. Penonome boasts the Omar Torrijos National Park, a vast wildlife refuge with great hiking trails. The Sarigua National Park in Parita features 8,000 hectares of semi-desert and a pre-Columbian settlement. El Valle de Antón is a quaint town in the middle of an extinct volcano and lush forests, luring hikers and bikers galore.

If it's sun, sand, and culture you crave, then head down to Panama. Our luxurious Panama vacation rentals await your arrival!
#Pathname:/vacation-rentals/Italy/
Ahh, Italia… even the name of this beautiful country is easy on the taste buds! Known as lo Stivale (the boot), Italy is the fifth most-visited country in the world, and for a variety of reasons. Home to exquisite artwork, varied terrain that includes everything from sky-high mountains to sweltering seasides, and, of course, outrageously delicious food, you can't go wrong in practically any corner of this sprawling country. Whether you're gazing at the Tower of Pisa or devouring a plate of carbonara, Italy has something for everyone to enjoy!

This stunning area is known for its towering mountains, colorful cliffside towns, sparkling lakes, and fashion-forward cities – each of which has its own unique history and attractions.

Mont Blanc (15,781 ft.), located just between the border of France and Italy, is the highest mountain in the Alps as well as the prime destination for many adventurers looking for skiing, snowboarding, and mountaineering. Lake Como and Lake Garda are world-famous for spectacular views and waters, and you’ll lose yourself shopping in Milan and Turin, which serve as business and fashion epicenters.

Along the coast, the Italian Riviera beckons with the vibrant port city of Genoa, as well as the five charming fishing villages called the Cinque Terre!

Best-known for the flooded streets and canals of Venice, this part of Italy boasts several fantastic cities as well as famous menu items that will keep your mouth watering for days. Although it is technically sinking, the water-built city of Venice maintains a cultural richness that’s difficult to beat – the gondolas slowly cruising the canals, the fantastic art galleries and recitals, the naturally romantic backdrop - it’s all still alive and well in Venice!

The rugged limestone cliffs and mountains of the Dolomites provide epic views and great hiking options, not to mention more ski resorts. Verona, Bologna, Ferrara, Parma, and Padua are all other fabulous cities with varied cuisine and shopping options to discover.

History buffs, art addicts, and nature-lovers alike will delight in Central Italy's diverse options for indoor and outdoor activities. Whether you're wine-tasting in the rolling hills of Tuscany, admiring ultra-famous artworks in Florence, immersing yourself in the 'City of Soul' (aka Rome), or wandering the lush green national parks of Abruzzo, this region has something for everyone to appreciate.

Although La Santa Sede, or the Vatican, is technically its own independent state, the views of Rome from the top are mind-blowing - regardless of your religion!

Rich in diversity, agriculture, and spectacular landscapes, Italy's south is a must-see for anyone looking for the full Italia experience.

Filled with coastal charm and a gritty, city-centric ambiance, Naples is the heart of the south. It stubbornly adjoins the base of Mt. Vesuvius (4,203 ft.), which is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, providing for ample excitement. The Pompeii ruins are one of the most visited attractions in Italy, and the numerous rustic castles, villages, and beaches along the Amalfi Coast attract thousands of tourists each year.

The Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Sicily each boast their own varied cultural escapes and attractions as well, not to mention absolutely gorgeous coastlines and delicious cuisine.

Wine, cheese, gelato, espresso, pasta, prosecco, pizza... did we mention the wine? Spend the day exploring different terrains or stuffing your stomach, and the nights filling your ears with classical opera music, or the chatter of the passionate Italian language!

Fiestas, Moorish architecture, vineyards, lime trees, and olive groves abound throughout this varied and dynamic land.

I am a Junior at Boise State University studying Psychology. I love people and hope to become an Occupational Therapist in order to help them overcome difficulties.

I am recently graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management. Winning the Vacasa scholarship last year was fantastic! I was/am an adult learner, with two children, and work a full time job. Every little bit helps when you're trying to support a family and go to school! I would encourage every student to apply for scholarships. I especially loved the Vacasa scholarship because I was able to write about something I love, the area I happen to live in!

My name is Jose Contreras. I was raised in the west coast (PDX), aka the best coast. I am currently at the UO working on obtaining a degree in advertising, my focus is art direction. During my down time I love designing random things. When school gets busy I'm still designing, because that's what I do. I am an od ball, a bit weird. I guess I embraced the whole "keep Portland weird." I love being different.

My name is Melanie and I am a stay at home mother of four. I am currently in college working towards my Masters degree in teaching. I am a native to the Pacific Northwest, born and raised.

My name is Katrina Dickinson. I'm 18 years old. I work as a receptionist at a real estate company. I babysit on "the side". I attend Portland Bible College and I'm one out of 6 children.

I?m trying to save up as much money as possible in scholarships to be able to attend college and hopefully law school in the future! I am a junior in high school who loves photography as my creative outlet, and hope to turn my hobby as a photographer into a side business while I build a career in the Law field!

I was born in South Carolina but moved to Newport, Oregon when I was five. I love living amongst the trees and the ocean, but life often keeps me too busy to enjoy the outdoors. I am a team captain on the NHS Swim Team and spend my hours in chlorinated water instead of the salty sea. Next year I will graduate from Newport High with an IB Diploma and then go off to university. I hope to spend the rest of my life here in the Northwest.

I'm a current college student from Eugene, Oregon, and I received $300 from Vasca scholarships for last fall term. This really helped me out with going to school; I'm so thankful for the opportunity Vacasa helped me acquire.

PORTLAND- Vacasa, named Oregon's fastest-growing private company by Inc. Magazine, announced that is has officially begun international expansion. The tech-based vacation rental management company now offers 20 properties on the Placencia peninsula in Belize.

Vacasa's Chief Operating Officer and co-founder Cliff Johnson says he and CEO Eric Breon have had Central and South American expansion in mind since the beginning.

"We chose the name Vacasa because we felt it had the potential for international branding- the second part means 'home' in Spanish," says Johnson. "All around the world, people are starting to choose vacation rentals more and more, and we're excited to be a part of this rising global trend."

Placencia is a TripAdvisor-ranked top tourist destination, playing home to almost 200,000 annual visitors from the United States alone. Located in the Caribbean Sea, visitors come for the tropical climate and world class fishing, sailing, snorkeling, and national parks.

Vacasa will introduce its full range of marketing and rate optimization technologies to all of its new properties. This tech-based backing, combined with a local, hands-on approach to care taking, is Vacasa's guiding strategy that has allowed the company to achieve rapid growth and success since its founding in 2009.

"In the last year and a half, we've used that strategy to bring West Coast vacation rental homeowners onto a more level playing field with much larger industries like hotels and resorts," says Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "In Belize, these industries tend to be even more dominant, but we're up for the challenge and can't wait to offer the opportunity to homeowners and travelers in a new part of the world."

Vacasa's Vice President of Business Developement Yael Livneh will initially run operations in Belize to ensure a smooth and consistent transition.

"It was crucial that we had someone on the ground to make sure that our first international destination is a success," says Johnson, "and Yael isn't too disappointed to leave the rainy Portland winter for sunny shores!"

Johnson saw the opportunity to go international when Shaul Streifler of Berkshire Hathway Home Services and Koenig Rubloff International contacted him about a potential partnership to introduce US investors to real estate opportunities in Belize. They began talking, but it wasn't until the duo met Boris Mannsfeld that things started coming together. Mannsfeld has been in the real estate industry in Belize for more than 20 years and was able to introduce Vacasa to several developers in the Placencia market who were eager to bring guests and buyers to the area.

Next up? Johnson says expansion to other countries like Panama and Mexico are already in the works, and the company's leadership team has begun preliminary discussions with potential European partners as well.

VACASA ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF POINTE WEST PROPERTIES IN GALVESTON

Galveston, TX- Vacasa, the nation's fastest-growing travel startup, announced today that it has acquired Pointe West Properties in Galveston, a popular vacation island located in southern Texas. The addition of Pointe West Properties' 32 vacation rentals marks Vacasa's first step toward introducing its brand of full-service property management to vacation rental homeowners in Texas.

Vacasa Director of Acquisitions Amber Knight said she is eager to add Galveston to Vacasa's expanding portfolio of vacation destinations throughout the United States.

"Texas has a long and well-established history of vacation rentals, and we're excited to be bringing a fresh and innovative perspective to the area," Knight said. "Vacasa excels in maximizing bookings during traditionally slow seasons and we are looking forward to boosting revenue for homeowners and supporting and growing the local Gulf economy."

Pointe West Properties employees will continue providing hands-on care and support as they join Vacasa's team of more than 500 employees. Pointe West Properties owner Lyndsey Garza said she is confident this will ensure a smooth transition for homeowners and clientele.

"The Pointe West Properties team and I are very excited to join Vacasa. When seeing the opportunities available to a small niche vacation rental company, I was confident that Vacasa was the answer to my desire to grow my business yet still maintain our personalized approach to the vacation rental experience," Garza said. "Vacasa has implemented many of the procedures and processes we previously desired, but were unable to resource as a small company."

Set on 33 miles of Texas coastline, Pointe West Properties offers visitors a combination of houses and condos, many of which feature views of Galveston Bay. Past visitors have enjoyed the properties' proximity to the beach and other family attractions like Moody Gardens, Schlitterbahn Waterpark, and Pleasure Pier.

Since 2009, Vacasa has grown rapidly through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions of companies like Pointe West.

"In the last year and a half, we've been able to introduce technology like rate optimization algorithms that have brought West Coast vacation rental homeowners onto a more level playing field with much larger industries like hotels and resorts," says Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon, "We're looking forward to bringing that same opportunity to Pointe West Properties."

PORTLAND, OR- Vacasa, named Portland's fastest-growing privately-owned company by the Portland Business Journal in June and the nation's fastest-growing private company in the travel industry by Inc. Magazine in August, has announced plans for large-scale growth in 2015. The tech-focused vacation rental management and marketing firm is expanding both nationally and internationally, with plans to hire more than 6,000 employees to support its growth.

"Our homeowners love the combination of local, hands-on care taking and a more innovative, tech-focused support staff" says  Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "In the last year and a half, we've been able to introduce technology like revenue optimization algorithms and customized in-home automation that have brought West Coast vacation rental homeowners onto a more level playing field with much larger industries like hotels and resorts. We can't wait to offer that same opportunity to homeowners - and travelers - in the rest of the world."

In the U.S., Vacasa plans to add its first homes in popular East Coast and Gulf Coast vacation destinations, including Cape Cod and the Gulf Shores. In addition to eastward expansion, Vacasa will continue to expand its portfolio of western properties, developing its presence in existing states and branching into new ones.

Internationally, Vacasa plans to introduce its brand of full-service property management to homeowners in Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, and Europe. This includes specific plans for a European launch in Tuscany and the Amalfi Coast in Italy, as well as Barcelona and Costa del Sol in Spain. Additional international destinations include Santiago, Chile, Nicaragua, Panama, and Ecuador.

"We're incredibly excited about the future of our company, and of the vacation rental industry as a whole," says COO/Co-Founder Cliff Johnson. "Across the country - and the globe - more travelers are choosing the privacy and comfort of a vacation home rental instead of a hotel. Our team at Vacasa is uniquely positioned to handle this growing demand with a trusted brand and consistent experience."

To meet the demands of such rapid expansion, Vacasa intends to grow its workforce from almost 500 employees to nearly 7,000 by the end of 2015. Vacasa intends to focus heavily on technology, analytics, and marketing positions, including plans to bring on a Chief Technology Officer, Director of Engineering, developers, Analytics Director, analysts, Marketing Director, PR Director, operations coordinators, and sales coordinators.

With 500 of these new positions expected to be Portland-based, Vacasa recently doubled the footprint of its Northeast Portland headquarters on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to nearly 10,000 square feet of office space.

"We have begun to build an incredible tech team and support staff here in Portland," says Johnson, "and we're thrilled to be creating more jobs locally for talented Oregonians."

The remaining positions will be remotely-based property managers, sales staff, and housekeeping roles in new and emerging Vacasa destinations. Approximately 1,500 of these local positions will be filled in Oregon, Vacasa's first and most successful market.

PORTLAND, OR- Nathan Rojas, a veteran of the United States Marines, is the recipient of a Veterans Day giveaway sponsored by Vacasa and the USO Northwest.

In honor of the holiday and all veterans who have served their country, our Portland-based vacation rental management company partnered with the USO Northwest to present a complimentary two-night stay in one of our oceanfront Oregon Coast rental properties. USO Northwest staff conducted the giveaway by asking Oregon veterans to share a meaningful story from their time of service.

The USO team selected Nathan Rojas as the recipient of the complimentary stay at the Oregon Coast, and we're privileged to be able to provide his family with a greatly-deserved getaway together. Here is Nathan's story:

"My name is Nathan Rojas, and I am a United States Marine. It has not been an easy journey but it is one that I am proud of. My experiences have ranged from scary, exciting, happy, sad, stressful, and most of all, rewarding. I would have to say, the one thing I will never forget occurred during my second deployment. My company was stationed in Afghanistan, and I couldn't have been more anxious and happy to be with my marines. Although, there was one thing I could not shake off no matter how how I tried; my pregnant wife.

We found out that we were going to be parents in August of 2011 and I was ecstatic - I was going to become a father for the first time. Soon after all of the excitement hit us, I quickly became upset; I was going to deploy four months later and I knew it. I realized I would not be home for the birth of my child.

However, I was grateful to find out that I was having a little girl, in the very last ultrasound I was allowed to see in person. The moment arrived when I had to leave my wife and my unborn daughter. I would dream about coming home and seeing my daughter every minute of the day.

Then the inevitable happened and we lost our first Marine, Paul. That is around the time it hit me that meeting my daughter was only just a dream at that point. It was not set in stone that I would ever meet her or that she would ever know about me. Each day that passed, I'd wonder if that would be my last day alive. Four more of my marines were killed as the months went on and I felt that it would soon be my time; meeting my baby girl seemed too good to be true.

I still prayed to God for a sign or to be able to see my daughter's face, even if through a photo. One day, we were allowed some down time and headed to the closest base to us, they had computers with internet access but I decided to shower and eat first and let my marines contact their families first. My friend Rick came running to me saying his girlfriend got in touch with my wife and she was in the hospital, in labor.

I immediately got on and emailed her. The hospital had a very strict policy on filming or webcams during childbirth or any medical procedures, so I knew I'd have to shut my computer off as soon as the baby would be delivered. It's sad to say I was no longer optimistic about much. I watched my friends get shot and injured in ways that I never thought possible and I lost men. Men whom, like me, had pregnant wives at home.

Then the unthinkable happened; my wife's doctor broke the rules and allowed me to stay on Skype long enough to watch my baby girl, Eva Abigail Rojas, come into the world. Words can not express how grateful I felt in that moment. I was blessed to see her first breath and to hear her first cries. It was magical and a true miracle.

Fast forward to six weeks later and I was finally on an airplane flying home! The moment finally came where I would meet my baby girl. I spotted my wife as soon as my bus pulled into the lot, she was holding a baby wrapped in a pink blanket and I just knew I was about to fall in love.

My wife had no idea I was standing behind her; I snuck up and gave her a kiss on the cheek and watched as she turned around and hugged me. She was so excited to introduce me to my daughter.

The moment I held my beautiful baby in my arms, I knew it was meant to be. I never thought I would ever see this day and here it was, so surreal, so rewarding and so magical. I sometimes wish I could have deployed at a different time, but then I think about how blessed I was, and that if anything would have been different, I may not have been so lucky.

My daughter is three years old now and she loves me more than I could ever know and I love her more than she could ever know. I never knew what true sacrifice was until that year and I would gladly do it all over again for my country and my family. This is my journey and it is one I am eternally grateful for and proud of."

We would like to thank Nathan and every veteran who shared their story with the USO team - but especially, thank you for your service, every day of the year.

BRIAN HEAD, UT - Vacasa , the nation's second largest vacation rental management company, is expanding its presence in Utah by partnering with local firm Brian Head Vacation Rentals. The partnership adds approximately 40 ski condos and cabins to Vacasa's portfolio of privately-owned, professionally-managed vacation homes.

Vacasa Director of Acquisitions Amber Knight said she is excited about Brian Head's potential as a vacation destination due to its proximity to five national parks, and its reputation as a low-cost alternative to Park City.

"We are looking forward to including Brian Head as we expand our successful marketing efforts to reach potential guests visiting Utah not only for the ski season, but off-season and summer visits as well," Knight said.

Brian Head Vacation Rentals co-owners Aaron and Emily Bradley will continue providing hands-on care and support, which they believe will help make the transition smooth for their property owners and clientele.

"This partnership offers our owners opportunities for growth that we're very excited about," said Emily Bradley. "Vacasa is able to invest resources in technology, support staff, and employee benefits that make the partnership incredibly appealing. Our team is looking forward to becoming part of the Vacasa family!"

Vacasa has grown rapidly since entering the Utah vacation rental market earlier this year. Since acquiring Utah Vacation Homes in April and Park City Resort Properties in August, Vacasa now manages about 120 vacation rentals in Utah, in a variety of destinations including Salt Lake City, Cottonwood Heights, Park City and Brighton.

Interested guests can visit Vacasa.com/usa/Utah/ or VacationBrianHead.com for details and online booking.

PORTLAND, OR- This week Inc. Magazine named Vacasa the 9th fastest-growing private company in the US, and the fastest-growing in the entire Travel and Hospitality industry.

Vacasa was founded in Portland in 2009, and their North Portland headquarters is home to 42 employees. The company has a strong presence in destinations like Mt. Hood, the Oregon Coast, Central Oregon, and the Columbia Gorge, and has been working to bring legal vacation rentals to the city of Portland itself. In total, Vacasa has 419 employees, with plans to triple that workforce over the coming year.  The company is currently hiring for 83 roles. Specific opportunities can be found at vacasa.com/careers.

"We hire talented local people, and we support them with world-class technology, said CEO Eric Breon.  "Our system both streamlines the management of homes and optimizes financial results for homeowners. This has attracted over 1,100 homes to Vacasa, which gives us a fantastic selection of properties for guests to choose from."

In interviews, Breon's most common question is "If you could design your own job here, what would it be?"  With such rapid growth, Vacasa offers nearly unlimited opportunity for advancement, and is focused on creating the perfect role for every employee.  Vacasa's Vice President of Operations, Kimberly Stapleton, started as a housekeeper while in graduate school. Now, less than four years later, she leads Vacasa's housekeeping and maintenance organization, which includes over 300 employees, and continues to grow rapidly.

Vacasa's rapid growth was due, in part, to the housing downturn. "We manage vacation homes, and prior to the financial downturn, people were buying vacation homes as an investment, without plans to rent them, said CEO Eric Breon. When the downturn hit, prices fell 40 percent. Combined with property taxes, maintenance, and more, homeowners were much more eager to explore renting their second home. This timing helped us quickly become one of the largest vacation rental companies in the country, and we now have owners earning over $100,000 annually by renting their home for periods it previously sat empty."

Beyond the financial benefits, homeowners have come to value the services provided by Vacasa.  According to Tracey Baron, the owner of Great Blue Lodge on Mt. Hood and The Blue Pelican on the Oregon Coast, "Owning vacation homes is so much easier now that they are managed by Vacasa. I used to personally manage my vacation homes, and I would struggle to keep up with all of the deferred maintenance and management duties, but not anymore.  Now, when I visit my properties, the lights are on waiting for me, the grounds are in good condition, and everything works properly.  I reserve my family's stays through the online owner log-in, then simply show up and enjoy our properties. I also have the luxury of Vacasa's housekeepers to clean when we leave if we don't want to do it ourselves.  My relationship with Vacasa has freed up a tremendous amount of my time and increased my revenue, which has allowed me to acquire additional properties and spend more time with my family. I trust in Vacasa to properly manage my vacation properties, and at the end of the day, that is what allows me to sleep at night."

On the other end of the spectrum, the financial performance offered by Vacasa has attracted savvy investors to the vacation rental space. Tony Hauser, a successful entrepreneur and real estate investor, recently purchased a nine-bedroom oceanfront home in Newport, OR specifically for Vacasa to manage. According to Hauser, "Vacasa has totally changed the dynamics of investing in vacation-oriented real estate. Thanks to Vacasa, I'm able to realize 7% cash return on this investment, along with the appreciation associated with oceanfront property and two weeks per year of tax-free use for my family." Hauser also reported that since his initial investment in his Newport home, he has purchased three more condos on the Oregon Coast and is in the market for additional properties.

Many of the homes Vacasa manages were previously managed "by owner", and advertised on sites like VRBO, Airbnb, and similar listing services.  "With our marketing and rate optimization technology, homeowners can earn considerably more from their homes, with us doing all of the work," said Breon.  "We guarantee homeowners that currently 'rent by owner' that they'll earn more with Vacasa, even after our fees, or we will refund the difference. We also offer a fixed rent option, in which we pay homeowners a set monthly amount, without any risk or seasonality."

A key driver of Vacasa's exceptional results is their revenue optimization system. "Our revenue optimization system is similar to those employed by airlines to maximized both revenue and occupancy on every flight," said Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "We use several hundred variables to set the optimal price for every night, at every home.  This approach increases revenue by over 30% versus homes that use more basic revenue management techniques, like simply relying on peak and off-season prices."

While primarily designed to benefit homeowners, Vacasa's revenue optimization system also creates discounts and last-minute savings for guests.  According to Scott Breon, "If the ski forecast isn't looking good for the coming weekend, our system will automatically discount last minute rates, so those people still planning a weekend trip can get a great deal."

When asked the secret of their success, Eric Breon said, "At Vacasa, we take an inherently local business - vacation rental property management - and do it over a wide geographic area.  Building the systems that make this possible was a big investment, but this gives us economies of scale not otherwise found in our industry."

Vacasa believes their greatest growth is still in the future. According to COO Cliff Johnson, "Over the past few years, we've been figuring out what it takes to do growth right, and we now have it down to a science. We're launching in 15 new markets on September 1st, and we plan to continue accelerating our pace of growth."

WALDPORT, OR-  -- On July 17th, Vacasa , the nation's second-largest vacation rental company, began managing the historic Cape Code Cottages  in Waldport. Long-time guests and new visitors alike filled Cape Cod Cottages to near-maximum capacity during Vacasa's opening management weekend.

"The Cape Cod Cottages are a landmark in Waldport, and it is exciting to see the parking lot full once again and lots of activity on the beach," Vacasa Regional Director Donna Rudd said.

First rented in 1938, Cape Cod Cottages overlooks a scenic stretch of shoreline along Big Stump Beach. The cottages include 10 fully-furnished units with small kitchenettes and two upper-level studio units. Vacasa plans to transform the former caretakers' accommodations into a premier rental, and has made initial property improvements including upgrading the complementary Wi-Fi access and welcoming travelers with dogs to the cottages for the first time.

"This five-acre oceanfront property is perfect for families or couples looking for reasonably priced accommodations, great views, and is centrally located for exploring all the Central Oregon Coast has to offer," Rudd said. "The upcoming planned renovations will make this wonderful property even better- these are exciting times for Cape Cod Cottages."

PORTLAND, OR - Portland-based property management firm  Vacasa has announced the release of their Smart Home system, designed in-house to specifically target the unique needs of vacation rental homes. With this industry-leading system, the company gains the capability to remotely manage thermostats and lighting in its portfolio of vacation rental homes, greatly improving the efficiency of each property.

The proprietary system was designed by Erik Tylek Kettenburg, Vacasa's own Chief Technology Officer.

"The Vacasa Smart Home platform is the most advanced management system of its kind in the vacation rental industry," said Kettenburg. "The brains of the system is the Vacasa Smart Home Gateway - it communicates via a special router over secure wireless signals with the other devices within the home, and was designed in-house to provide a reliable solution customized to the unique needs of vacation rentals."

With the new technology, Vacasa homes will be able to utilize electronic thermostats and smart locks compatible with the Smart Home system. The thermostats will allow employees to monitor home temperatures and energy usage. Homes can be set to a comfortable temperature prior to a guest's arrival, but returned to a setting for minimal energy when unoccupied. Not only will this reduce unnecessarily heating or cooling empty homes, but save on energy costs of employees physically traveling to homes to adjust heating or monitor thermostats during inclement weather. Employee travel will also be reduced thanks to the homes' smart locks, which offer unique codes for every guest that can be reset and unlocked remotely.

In the near future, Vacasa plans to add smart light switches to the system, allowing lights to be controlled remotely. With over 1,000 homes under their management, Vacasa estimates the new Smart Home system could save owners $1,000 in energy costs annually.

The Smart Home system is the most recent step in Vacasa's efforts to reduce their carbon footprint - the company's prior initiatives include providing in-house recycling whenever possible and ordering sustainable products, from eco-friendly toiletries and cleaning supplies to LED light bulbs.

"We've always been committed to keeping our homes as efficient as possible," Vacasa's Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon said. "And the Smart Home system significantly extends those possibilities!"

YACHATS, OR- Vacasa, the nation's second-largest vacation rental company, has taken over management of the iconic Ocean Cove Inn in Yachats. The inn's nine rooms all include ocean views and small kitchenettes, and the property is located within walking distance of downtown Yachats' shopping and dining district.

The Ocean Cove Inn has received five-star ratings from TripAdvisor over the last two years, and the   Portland-based management firm has already completed several updates to the inn. Vacasa has transformed the former caretakers' quarters into the property's premier guest rental, upgraded the   complimentary high-speed Internet access, and begun welcoming travelers with dogs to the Ocean Cove Inn for the first time.

"The Ocean Cove Inn is such a charming boutique motel, and has a fantastic reputation in Yachats," said Vacasa Regional Director Donna Rudd. "Our team is honored to have the opportunity to carry that tradition forward."

Vacasa now manages more than 430 rental properties along the Oregon Coast, with a handful of inns and   motels complementing its portfolio of privately-owned, single-family vacation homes.

"A boutique motel appeals to guests who are just looking for a quick one-night stay, or might not need as   much as space as a private rental home," said Rudd. "We're looking forward to being able to meet those   travelers' needs as well, while still providing the exemplary customer service that has helped Vacasa   become so popular with visitors to the Oregon Coast."

Interested guests can visit VacasaRentals.com/usa/Ocean-Cove-Inn for details and online booking.

PORTLAND, OR- Vacasa was named the fastest-growing private company in the Portland region by the Portland Business Journal on Thursday, June 12th. The vacation rental management company earned the first-place ranking on a list of 100 companies due to their three-year revenue growth percentage - which the PBJ described on their website as an "almost-comical" 3,000-plus percent.

"It is a great honor to receive this award, and very humbling to be among the great companies that made this list," said Cliff Johnson, Vacasa's Chief Operating Officer. "We are planning to continue our growth by three to four times annually... so we hope to be back year after year!"

Since the company's founding in 2009, Vacasa has increased their portfolio of vacation homes to more than 1,000 rentals located throughout seven states: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, California, and Hawaii. Their staff, which began with Johnson and CEO Eric Breon, has grown to include more than 300 employees, including 209 in Oregon alone.

"It takes a great team to make a company grow like this, and we have been very fortunate to add exceptional employees at every phase of our growth plan," said Johnson. "We are always looking for ways to improve, and the best way we've done that is by adding new employees with expertise in perceived areas of weaknesses."

In 2014, Vacasa plans to add several hundred more rentals - both by signing individual owners and by focusing on acquisitions. The company also foresees hiring nearly 1,000 additional employees over the next year, with approximately 25% of those positions being located in Oregon.

"We don't foresee our growth slowing down anytime soon," said Chief Strategy Officer Scott Breon. "And it's not just about hiring more employees; we really pride ourselves on providing significant advancement opportunities to the talented individuals already on our staff."

The vacation rental industry itself is one of the fastest-growing segments of the travel sector, and Vacasa entered the market just before the economic downturn of 2009 prompted many second home owners to explore renting their properties to paying guests. Vacasa's motto is "vacation rentals made easy", and the company provides full-service property management for hundreds of homeowners, including advertising, housekeeping, reservations, and maintenance. For guests, the company emphasizes online reservations and automated check-in services to make staying in a vacation home as simple and straightforward as a traditional hotel.

BOISE, ID- Portland-based vacation rental management firm Vacasa Rentals recently acquired Utah Vacation Homes, marking Vacasa's expansion into its seventh state in the Western US. With the addition of Utah Vacation Homes' 56 properties, located throughout Park City and Salt Lake City, Vacasa's portfolio will number over 900 privately-owned vacation homes.

Utah Vacation Homes' employees, including Vacation Rental Managers Association Board of Directors member Tristan Webb, will be retained and added to Vacasa's roster of over 200 employees.

"We're excited to be working in a world-class destination like Park City," said Vacasa's founder and CEO Eric Breon. "And we know that Tristan brings a passion and vision for the entire vacation rental industry along with his years of experience. We're looking forward to growing together as we bring the Vacasa brand both to current UVH owners, and as we expand throughout Utah."

The UVH acquisition occurred as a result of Vacasa's straightforward approach when exploring new markets: the company makes a habit of reaching out to existing companies or rental agents that might be interested in business partnerships with a larger brand.

"The Utah Vacation Homes team and I are very excited to join the Vacasa team," said Webb. "Vacasa has implemented many of the procedures and processes we previously desired, but were unable to resource as a small company. I am excited to be part of the most technologically sophisticated company in the vacation rental industry."

Vacasa also manages homes in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Idaho, California, and Hawaii. The company, which was founded in 2009, is focused on further expansion into Southern California as well as Utah.

"While we've grown very quickly, we've been able to sustain our success because we invest in marketing and rate optimization, so we can earn our owners higher rental income on more bookings," said Breon. "And while Park City is primarily a ski market, I feel confident that we can show the newest homeowners in the Vacasa family just how well we can book out the summer as well."

PORTLAND, OR- Over the next two months, Portland-based vacation rental management firm Vacasa plans to hire more than 50 new employees throughout the state of Oregon.

While some of the new employees joining the IT staff and marketing team will work out of Portland's newly expanded office in Northeast Portland, many of Vacasa's new hires will not be Portland-based. As the company predicts record occupancy rates this summer in the nearly 400 vacation homes they manage on the Oregon Coast, they face the same dilemma as many tourism-based businesses: seasonal fluctuations require lots of housekeepers in the summer and over holidays, but far fewer in the spring and fall.

"Traditionally, many companies within the vacation rental industry are forced to simply lay off the bulk of their workforce for the majority of the year," says Vacasa CEO Eric Breon. "We're determined to avoid that. We want to provide consistent work, and a modern work environment, for all of our employees not just the ones in management roles."

As Vacasa has grown (the five-year-old company now employs 275 people to care for over 900 homes across six states), they have prioritized hiring housekeepers, maintenance staff, and reservationists who are motivated toward internal growth.

"Part of our staffing strategy is to have a core team of hybrid employees who are qualified to fill many roles and able to work full-time instead of seasonal part-time positions," says Breon. "Reservations, housekeeping, maintenance and care of our homes, and even sales-focused roles can all fluctuate depending on the time of year. And during our busiest times, we can supplement our core team with college students and other employees who specifically seek out seasonal work."

Vacasa also places a premium on creating a modern, flexible workplace. Almost all employees, including housekeepers, are provided smartphones with internal apps to make scheduling and communicating in the field as easy as possible. Telecommuting and flexible scheduling is also encouraged among employees who work out of Vacasa's offices in Portland and Boise, and all employees are immediately eligible for 401k matches. Additionally, the company places a large emphasis on internal growth.

"We've had many employees who have started as housekeepers or interns, and moved into management positions," Vacasa co-founder and COO Cliff Johnson says. "The very first housekeeper we hired has moved up so much that she recently became the head of our entire operations team - she was managing a team of more than 30 employees and contractors and coordinating all of our maintenance for our entire portfolio of homes."

Vacasa's current hiring needs range from web developers and analysts to office assistants, housekeepers, and reservations agents. Interested parties should visit the company's website at vacasa.com/careers for current openings and online applications.
