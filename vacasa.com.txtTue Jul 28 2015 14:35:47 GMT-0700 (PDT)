From laid-back beach cottages along the Oregon Coast to luxury ski chalets in Vail to tropical getaways in Belize, Vacasa offers just the right retreat for any guest.

In today's busy world, a vacation is a precious opportunity to relax and reconnect with loved ones. Spending that valuable time in a real live home can be especially rewarding, from cooking breakfast together each morning to relaxing by the fireplace every night. Our mission is simple: to make vacation rentals easy.

Vacasa offers the unique combination of professional management in privately-owned homes, making it possible for our guests to enjoy a one-of-a-kind vacation experience without compromising on service and convenience. Our team of passionate hospitality professionals is the finest in the industry, with each Vacasa team member (from housekeepers to reservations agents to local managers) working hard to ensure that each home and every guest is well cared for.

Vacasa is also committed to giving back to the local communities where we manage vacation homes.

Q: How old do I need to be to reserve a home?

A: In order to reserve one of our vacation homes everyone who is traveling must be at least 21 years old or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. In some areas, the age requirement may be higher. Please give us a call at 503-345-9399 for more information.

Q: Do infants count toward the maximum occupancy?

A: Generally, children under the age of 2 do not count toward the maximum occupancy.

Q: Can I bring my dog along?

A: Dogs are allowed in many of our homes. Prior to bringing your dog, you must check with Vacasa and pay the required nightly pet fee.

Q: What is the difference between FlipKey/VRBO and your site?

A: VRBO/FlipKey/HomeAway are advertising sites. We are the property management company that manages everything from marketing to maintenance and housekeeping. We advertise on VRBO and other sites to get our homes the most visibility.

Q: Can I bring more people than the maximum allowed listed?

A: Maximum occupancy does not only refer to the number a home can sleep, this is also the number of people allowed in the home at any given time. It is determined by the licensing authority based on the number of exits in the home and fire safety evacuation plan. Some counties or HOA's have codes that are strictly enforced. Please abide by the maximum occupancy number for the home at all times.

Q: What does Trip Protection cover? Is there a time-frame as to when I can add trip protection?

A: If Trip Protection is purchased, you will receive a full refund for any nights of your reservation cancelled due to a death in the family, illness, flight delays, flight cancellations, or road closures due to bad weather. You can add Trip Protection up to 30 days prior to your reservation. If you are booking and your check-in date is already within 30 days into your reservation, Trip Protection may only be added within 24 hours from the time of booking.

Q: I tried to book a reservation online but it gave me an error. How do I know my reservation is secured?

A: When booking online, if you hit the submit button more than once this will result in you receiving an error message that says either your dates are unavailable or that you already have a reservation. Typically the reservation goes through, but you are welcome to call us at 503-345-9399 to confirm.

Q: Can I get a breakdown of the total cost?

A: The rental quote includes all lodging, taxes, and fees. The breakdown of the total cost is in the green box on the website if you book the reservation online at vacasa.com. Simply click the green box to get the breakdown.

Q: What is Vacasa's cancellation policy?

A: You may cancel within the first 24 hours of booking the reservation with a full refund. Rental payments (less a 5% processing fee) are refundable up until 30 days prior to the reservation. We are unable to offer refunds on reservations cancelled within 30 days of the check-in date unless you purchase our optional Trip Protection plan and the reason for cancellation falls within the trip protection guidelines.

Q: What is the pet policy?

A: Pets are permitted in selected homes, depending on owner preferences. Some owners may have pet allergies and we ask that you only bring your pets into pet-friendly homes. The standard fee is $10 per pet, per night, with a minimum rate of $40 per reservation. The pet maximum and fee may vary by unit and will be listed on the home's webpage.

Q: Do you have any homes without a two night minimum stay?

A: Most of our homes have at least a two night minimum stay. We do have some condos and studios that allow for a one night stay and they should appear when searching for your dates.

Q: Do you take partial payments or must I pay in full upon booking?

A: All reservations under $2000 must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 but within 60 days of check-in must be paid in full at the time of booking. Reservations over $2000 with partial payments and more than 60 days out must be paid in full 30 days before the start date of the reservation.

Q: Do you allow weddings in your homes?

A: Some of our homes do allow weddings with the owner's approval. Depending on the home, there may be additional fees, parking restrictions and guest count maximums. Please call us at 503-345-9399 for more details.

Q: How can I modify my reservation, and are there any fees associated with that?

A: Please call us at 503-345-9399 to help you modify your reservation. There could be additional fees depending on the change occurring, but we will walk you through everything before finalizing it.

Q: Do you have monthly rates for your homes?

A: The maximum number of nights one of our homes can be booked for is 29. Therefore, we do not offer monthly rates. The rates for our homes vary based on day of the week, local events, and season.

Q: I found a better unit than the one I booked, would I be able to modify my reservation and change it to the new unit?

A: It is possible to switch homes as long as the change is made more than 30 days prior to the reservation. If the modification results in a higher rental rate guests are responsible for paying the difference. Reservations can be modified without penalty up to 24 hours from making the reservation.

Q: Would I need to sign a rental contract for renting a vacation rental?

A: By booking a reservation, guests acknowledge and agree to abide by Vacasa's rental policies. Some of our homes will require you to sign a reservation contract agreeing to policies that are specific to that home. We ask that you review and sign the contract and return it to us via email or fax.

Q: How do I go about booking a vacation as a gift for a friend?

A: You can book and pay for a reservation for another person. However, you must ensure that the name and all contact information listed on the reservation, including the email address, are for the person that will be staying in the home.

Q: What is the difference between a hotel and a vacation rental?

A: All of our vacation rentals are owned by private home-owners and can be preferable to hotels for a number of reasons. They are typically more comfortable, offer kitchens for preparing meals and are more accommodating to those traveling with children and/or pets. Vacation rentals also offer a wider variety of accommodations which enables them to fit any vacation need, be that a mountain home for 25 or a beach cottage for 2.

Q: How do I pay for a reservation?

A: We accept the following credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express. We also accept electronic checks for reservations booked more than 30 days in advance.

Q: Is smoking allowed in the home?

A: Smoking is prohibited on the rented premises.

Q: Does the home come with linens and towels, or do I need to bring my own?

A: The home will be equipped with all the basic necessities. All the beds will be made with fresh linens and bath towels will be provided. If you would like beach towels, we recommend bringing those with you.

Q: What items can I expect to find in the home?

A: Please see the features and amenities section of the home listing. Vacasa also provides a few items to get you started, including: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, and small trash can liners. If there is something specific that you require, please make sure you bring it with you.

Q: What cable package does the home have? Will we be able to watch the game?

A: Rental properties are individually owned and each home will have a different cable vs streaming option. Vacasa cannot guarantee Television service or TV Channel availability.

Q: If I want to order the UFC Fight, a movie, or a game can I do so and have it charged to my credit card on file?

A: Our homes generally do not provide any sort of pay-per-view service.

Q: How do I obtain the keys?

A: We will e-mail check-in instructions 7 days prior to your stay including driving directions and the code to the lock box or electronic deadbolt.

Q: The lockbox only has one set of keys. Can we get another set?

A: We prefer the keys stay in the lockbox so that each member of your party can access the home at any time. This will eliminate the need for multiple key sets. It also prevents the keys from getting lost.

Q: There are two lockboxes here. Am I using the right one?

A: The lockbox closest to the door or on top is usually the guest lockbox. The other one is for our cleaning and maintenance staff. Occasionally the plates get swapped. If you are having trouble getting in using the code, try it on the other lockbox.

Q: Can I not pay the cleaning fee if I clean the home myself, rather than using your cleaning services?

A: No. Guests are not allowed to clean after their own stay. Our housekeepers meet very strict guidelines and are required to clean the home after each guest vacates.

Q: We've run out of toilet paper. Can you bring us some more?

A: Vacasa provides a starter kit of supplies only. If you think you will need more than what is provided, please make sure to bring some with you.

Q: We can't find any paper towels or dishwashing detergent. Can you bring us some?

A: Please check in all cabinets (under the sink, above the refrigerator) and if you cannot find what you are looking for, we will gladly reimburse you for picking some up. The same goes for the following items: shampoo, conditioner, soap, paper towels, coffee filters, carpet spot cleaner, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, dishwashing liquid, dishwasher pacs/pods, dish brush, kitchen trash bags, small trash can liners, and propane for the grill.

Q: We can't get the fireplace/internet/hot tub/etc. working. Are there instructions in the house?

A: You should have received an email from us with check-in instructions that includes a link to a digital guest binder. With your reservation number, you will have access to all your house instructions. However, if no instructions are found or if you need further assistance please contact one of our Customer Service Agents at 503-345-9399.

Q: I am allergic to pet dander and other smells, but I want to stay in a pet friendly home. Is there any way to ensure that I won't be bothered by them for my stay?

A: All our homes are thoroughly cleaned after each stay. However, we are unable to guarantee that you will not have a reaction to a home that has been regularly occupied by pets.

Q: What are the check-out procedures?

A: Check-out is at 11AM and upon your departure we ask that you start the first load of laundry if there is a washer and dryer in the home. If you have time to begin a second load it is greatly appreciated by our housekeeping staff. A $75 per hour fee will be assessed for failing to vacate the unit by the agreed upon check-out time.

Q: Do I have to check in by a certain time?

A: Check-in is at 4 PM and guests can arrive any time after. There are some cases when early check-in is available. If that is the case, we will email you the morning of your stay to inform you that an early check-in option is available. Please note that we will not be able to confirm or deny an early check in request prior to the day of check in due to our cleaning schedules.

Q: Do you allow early check-ins?

A: An early check-in is dependent on whether or not the housekeeper has time to fully clean the home before your arrival. If guests are checking out the same day that your reservation begins, an early check-in is not allowed as it will not allow the housekeeper enough time to fully prepare the home for you. We will email you the morning of your check-in if early check-in is available.

Q: Can I get a late check out?

A: Late check-out is available if we do not have another reservation that night. There is a fee (plus taxes) associated. The fee varies from house to house. We can tell you if a late check-out is available three days before check-in. If you pay for late check-out you will have the home until midnight the day you check-out.

Q: What is your lost and found policy?

A: We will return your lost item to you if you call us within two weeks of your departure date. We do charge a $25 fee, plus shipping to cover the cost of labor, drive time, and postal fees. Any items not claimed within two weeks will be donated to a local charity.

We are not a single office, position, department, city, or region - we are a team! Every employee at Vacasa is critical to our success and our mission. We encourage employees to take advantage of each of our teammates' skills and talents for problem-solving - and treat other teammates with the same respect that they want to receive.

As we grow, both learning and teaching are critical to our team's success. Each team member should take the time to teach their co-workers how to be successful in areas in which they excel, and ask for insight from their teammates. Continually seek growth for themselves as an individual, for their role within Vacasa, and for Vacasa itself as a company.

3. We count on you

Behind each positive guest experience are countless Vacasa employees that were involved in creating that result. Any missing part to our machine jeopardizes our ability to deliver. We count on each employee to be on time, to complete their tasks, and to excel in their role. Each employee's input is crucial to our success!

4. Do the right thing

Be honest, be trustworthy, be ethical - even when no one is looking.

Vacation rentals made easy." We conduct business simply to create a consistent experience for owners, guests, and employees alike.

We help create amazing memories and fun experiences for our guests and owners. Our employees carry that into the workplace to create a positive and enjoyable environment with their teams every day.

Lots of growth requires lots of change - so embrace it! If an employee thinks a process could be easier or more efficient, they are encouraged to talk to their manager and take ownership to drive change in that area and each employee is asked to support the changes their teammates are driving in other areas.

Because "This is the way it has always been done" is never good enough. Instead, employees are encouraged seek out new ways to improve our policies and practices - and always be open-minded to new ideas, pushing the limits, and willing to think outside the box.

Here at Vacasa, we help travelers experience unforgettable vacations...and we look at working at Vacasa as an epic adventure of its own!

When you grow as quickly as we have been, every year (and month, and week, and OK, every day!) is an exciting one. We embrace opportunities, and have a tendency to hand out responsibilities to our employees to see how they can stretch and challenge themselves. This is a place to grow as an individual, and to be part of our collective growth as a company and a team...and so far, it's been an unbelievably rewarding journey together.

Day-to-day, we also have a lot of fun. We don't all work in the same office, of course—there's our Portland headquarters, our second office in Boise, and hundreds of amazing Vacasa teams across the country caring for homes, helping guests, and growing our business. Our local teams become very tight-knit, but we also love to gather in bigger groups at our regional Vaconferences, where our Vacasa leaders make sure that every employee understands the company's vision, our mission, and how much we appreciate every Vacaser from coast to coast!

Since our founding in 2009, Vacasa has grown from a single home in Long Beach, WA to managing thousands of homes, from beach cottages on the Oregon Coast to ski cabins in Vermont to tropical retreats in Belize—and beyond! We were ranked #9 on the Inc 500 in 2014 and continue to expand exponentially. The secret to our success? Exceptional local team members, a system that makes things easy, and a strong passion for the work we do!

Our rapid growth offers tremendous potential, and our company is committed to cultivating individual talents and skill sets. If you're looking to get out of a dead-end job, Vacasa is the place for you! Vacasa is looking to fill numerous job openings in our several growing regions.

Vacasa's success and continued growth would not be possible without our team of valued employees. Interested in becoming a key player and joining the Vacasa family? View our job openings to find a career that excites you!

When Eric and his wife Alia took responsibility for caring for Alia's family’s summer home, he learned firsthand how much work vacation homes can really be. And when he discovered there wasn’t a professional management company on the West Coast that could provide the services he was looking for, he decided to start one? and that’s how Vacasa was born. Today, the family's Long Beach, Washington cottage is one of over 1900 Vacasa homes spread throughout the globe - and our motto remains “vacation rentals made easy”.

Problem-solving, creativity, and openness: that’s our founder, CEO, and fearless leader in a nutshell. Eric has always driven Vacasa with his strong vision, but he’s also made it a priority to empower employees to help shape the company and their roles within it. Eric's conversations with Vacasa employees often start with three questions: “What do you like most about your job? What are you best at? OK, how can you spend more of your time doing that?”

Eric lives in Boise with his wife Alia and their two sons, Rhys and Rowen. He bikes to work daily, runs year-round, spends the summer mountain-biking, and spends the winter skiing - either backcountry, or in-bounds with his three year old son Rhys. And during Eric?s considerable travel to Vacasa destinations across the Western US, he stays in vacation rentals - to spend as much time as possible with friends, family, and employees.

Cliff is Vacasa’s co-founder, Chief Development Officer, and the most good-natured attorney you’ll ever meet. While still a member in good standing with the Colorado and California State Bars, Cliff’s role at Vacasa has always been more about relationship-building.

Since he first joined Eric at his kitchen table to launch Vacasa back in 2009, Cliff has overseen the expansion of our family of Vacasa home owners. Today, he leads our business development team with his obvious passion for connecting with our owners and sharing how Vacasa can make their lives easier.

Cliff lives in Southeast Portland with his wife Kate and their lab/pit mix Muddy, adopted from Portland's Pixie Project. In addition to his role at Vacasa, Cliff serves as a board member for Eugene-based MAPLE Microdevelopment. He has also completed the Eugene Marathon in 2012 and 2013 as part of a benefit for MAPLE, and he has produced, directed, and acted in several theatrical productions from Boston to Denver... and Cliff leads Vacasa’s Portland kickball team (although we don’t hold our abysmal 2014 record against him).

Kimberly’s current title is Vice-President of Operations, but she’s worn a lot of hats since being hired in 2010 as Vacasa’s third-ever employee. Today, she applies her attention to detail and hands-on leadership style to nearly all the areas she previously worked in: housekeeping, property management, maintenance, owner services, and guest experience.

With a professional background in interior design, Kimberly’s been known to rearrange furniture constantly (her own, her friends’, whomever doesn’t try too hard to stop her) and fulfill the Portlandia stereotype by making jewelry on the side.

If you want to talk about numbers, Scott’s listening - or two steps ahead. Since joining Vacasa in 2013, he has introduced our company - and in many ways, the vacation rental industry - to the power of data. From our rate optimization algorithms to the nitty-gritty of our marketing strategy, Scott has helped use data to deliver a better experience to our owners and our guests.

Scott's a tried-and-true Northeast Portlander, where he lives with his wife Lisa and hound dog Juno. He’s been actively involved in community-building, from serving as Chair of the King Neighborhood Association to co-founding the Friends of Last Thursday Art Walk organization. When not crunching numbers or supporting civic functions, you'll find Scott snowboarding on Mt. Hood or exploring the bountiful hikes Oregon provides. Scott also likes to stage his life milestones on mountaintops: he proposed to Lisa on Mount St. Helen’s, and they tied the knot at Skibowl’s warming hut on Mt. Hood.

Erik-with-a-K is our wizard behind the curtain: as CTO since 2011, he oversees all of our in-house technology, from our business applications to our website to our Smart Home Automation systems. And he does it all from his farm in southwest Washington, where he lives with his wife Jenni, daughter Maple, and a menagerie of horses, chickens, geese, dogs, and a guinea pig.

Erik’s professional background and personal interests are centered around open-source hardware and software. His “side project” is Digistump, a company he began after creating three of the most successful Kickstarter projects in the Portland area (Digispark, DigiX, and Digispark Pro). This led to Erik being featured in Steven Osborn’s book “Makers at Work: Folks Reinventing the World One Object or Idea at a Time”. And in his nearly nonexistent free time, Erik continues to be involved in the tech community by serving as an advisor to start-ups like Glowdeck and Brewbot.
